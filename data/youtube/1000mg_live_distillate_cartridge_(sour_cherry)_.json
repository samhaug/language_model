if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on

at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to

"7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "OHTBbns6PMQ": "so today we're going to be going over the og kush gram distance by kraft um you're going to see me mention later that it's like also branded oil as well but it's spike craft so let's get into it all right this is a full gram or a thousand milligram uh og kush cartridge this is by craft oil cartridge by craft um and i want to say i picked these up for about like 15 bucks or so and um i will say it didn't work initially on my yokan styx battery and then i tried it on a ooze battery uh and it didn't work so i had to resort to my magneto and it works on my magneto so i don't know the hardware is kind of weird for these i guess that's always been like an issue that i remember having with these because i've had some of these before in the past but other than that uh they're really good cartridges and they're really great they taste this one in particular doesn't really like have like a flavor it's not like a flavored cartridge per se this is like o.j kush you know more like a weed strain so it's got really no terpenes for like you know to taste any kind of way that you would think it would make it taste fruity or good but other than that these don't taste like terpene-wise like or without the terpenes i should say don't taste too bad so these are pretty fire all right so we were talking about the thousand milligram or gram craft oil cartridge i got this at the golden meds federal location and uh i want to say i paid if i didn't i already mentioned it like what uh 12 or like 15 bucks and at that location that's the location where i had the incident like i said where i bought the uh veritas or the veritas and it came empty that's also where i got the uh consumables the keef drinks and soda or whatever but they're going to come these cartridges when you open them like i said i'm going to insert a photo or picture of the containers and tubes what it looks like the packaging and they're going to come with these uh orange tips here and i like these because these are nice i'll keep these on there after i'm like using it still after i've already opened it because what it'll do is it'll help keep like lint and stuff out of the tip and whatnot you'll get some like gunk and [ __ ] in the tips and sometimes you hit them and then they're clogged or whatever you just get some crap in there and then it goes back down into your cartridge and it can kind of mess it up so you don't want to do that but other than that the taste on these like i said they're going to be very earthy they're going to have like a normal like not really any kind of terpene taste that like any terpenes added to it to make it taste like flavorful or like fruity or like any of those flavored ones because this one like i said is uh oji kush so very very good earthy taste i recommend like if you're out there in colorado at all ever anywhere in the dispensaries you can get a hold of the oil the craft cartridges go ahead and make sure you do really great good quality distillate but that's going to wrap it up it's going to be a short one and just a quick review of that cartridge i was only able to get one of them and uh yeah so like i said stay tuned for anything cannabis related or you know smoking related so peace the [ __ ] out like comment and subscribe", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would

video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "2Ez-_fyqK7g": "[Music] you know like I'm completely protected from this I there's my door right there someone decides to walk out they'll just see me and the teachers walk out there all the time no gang signs of my hairline kid but I got a bandana on cuz you know it's because that's true but like alright so I'm home from school I went with my Nana during the weekend once again which it's I'm happy I love it hello going here it's the Q's dong in war right here it's awesome Ellen you know look that good right now cuz it's just rain but it's are it's just beautiful in the sunshine yes yeah he's my protector I guess hey buddy how are you how are you so yeah I'm not gonna wrap it up my school video cuz like I made a video in school it's you've already seen it so yeah peace out guys", "R0FAuYfxmNw": "if you watch the show often you know i typically roll but i'm feeling lazy tonight so i'm gonna pack a cone friends tell me [Music] how you guys doing tonight it's gp here from cbd hemp library um if you watched the show before then you recognize me if you haven't welcome to the show welcome to your first episode it's kind of crazy to think for me to think that this could be somebody's first episode really just because we've made 300 not even because we're so big or anything because we're not that big but it's just wild for some of the first video to be the 300th video but let me get into said video what are we talking about today i guess today i'll talk about the downsides of delta eight thc sorry i'm about to start packing this and then i'll get to talking all right so the downside to delta eight thc well for me i would say the downsides depend on the product so for the first product i will talk about i will talk about edibles which we do have on sale right now one bottle left but with the edibles the biggest downside to me in all honesty which is something you'll deal with with all thc so this is i'm probably gonna get some comments below like that's if you deal with anything but the cottonmouth associated with delta h thc edibles seems to be more intense than other edibles and other forms of thc that i've had whether it's smoking delta eight whether it's a delta eight tinctures whether it's normal delta nine the cottonmouth associated with delta h thc just always seems to be extreme like sergio says it as well when the edibles the a big way you can tell they're starting to hit in my opinion is that cottonmouth really starts to starts to settle in so if this is something that you deal with please comment below um i don't want people to think i'm crazy and i'm sure you don't think i'm crazy because it is a normal a normal marijuana issue if you will but at the same time in my experience or in my opinion how much cotton mouth you get for how much you eat for delta eight edibles it's intense really don't need much more than that see i only have it like a little over halfway so typically i just burn off the top if i don't want to pack the whole thing sometimes i don't want to pack the whole thing i'll be sitting here talking to you guys forever if i smoke that whole thing and i know y'all don't want that [Music] i am packing some rocket fuel inside this cone today and we do have it on sale as well because square is [ __ ] with us but the next the next downside i would say about delta 8 t8c is with the carts and we haven't gotten a lot of complaints with our carts but many of the carts many of the disposables they leak in the normal delta 9 they leak as well but for some reason or maybe with some distillates um the delta 8 just seems to be so runny like if we get some delta eight dabs and we leave them out at like room temperature a lot of times they get runny they get liquidy everything gets sticky which is another downside when it's running and gets sticky and they get nasty if you have a disposable and it gets on the top then you put in your pocket now you have lint hanging off the top of your disposable and it's just not an ideal situation so the viscosity of um delta eight thc um the the distillate is another downside i would say a lot of times it gets really messy if you're dealing with the dabs if you're dealing with the dabs i would really suggest freeze them um and that's something you could say for dogs 9 as well but often delta 9 you can still leave them at room temperature and they're okay many times the delta eight dabs are not okay at room temperature any of you guys that smoke delta dabs watch out for that and for the carts make sure you vape them at the right temperature and not all of them are the same but in general i've seen the 2.5 to kind of uh i would say even up to 3.5 depending on what type of terps are in there um for them oh [ __ ] i forgot to head back but that's what i would really suggest is to just find the right temperature when it comes to the vapes or else if it's at too low of a temperature then it pulls it not already vaporized and so now you have even extra oil pulling up with a already liquidy substance so guys when it comes to distillate one be careful in terms of putting your hands on and stuff like that because because it comes because it becomes really sticky but also just make sure that you also freeze the dabs when you get them and make sure that the temperature is right when you set the pin which i would say i'd say 2.5 more than like like 2.7 to 3.5 somewhere in there um to make sure that it's not too harsh but also make sure that you're vaporizing the distillate before it kind of goes up the up the cylinder so that's a tip for you guys but that's also kind of a downside with delta eight is the viscosity or the lack of viscosity i didn't do too well in science but i know viscosity is the resistance of things to flow so that would mean since it doesn't have a lot of resistance to it flow it would have a low viscosity right please comment below if i'm correct i may be smoking but i will just some school another downside about delta hthc next i'll talk about the flour so when it comes to the flour um the distillate is infused with cbd flour that's what delta 8 flour is so now more things are at play so the cbd flour has to first off be quality cbd flour the distillate has to be quality distillate and it has to be infused correctly to where there's oil throughout the bud because a lot of times they'll just spray it'll be a light coat on the outside but all that dense cbd flower on the inside has no delta eight therefore you're getting uneven smoke it's sprayed unevenly it's just not a good situation so um that's another downside to delta thc and it's not saying that's all budged you have to be careful you have to make sure the company is using good cbd flour is using good distillate and is infused throughout and these are questions you could ask like if you ask us i can tell you that our rocket fuel is infused throughout and it is the top shelf on cbd buds but that's something that you should ask these companies before you buy it just in my opinion because that's what we've seen and we're in the industry obviously trying as many things as anybody i'm told i can tell you that some of the cbd flour it's harsh because the cbd flour isn't good and also um some of the distillate that we also smoke is pretty low quality on top of the fact that sometimes the buds aren't infused well with the distillate which doesn't make for as pleasant of a smoking experience considering that we do have dota 8 products available i am definitely not making this video um to scare anyone off from using delta 8 thc but at the same time i think that informed customers are always good customers so i just wanted to kind of let you guys know and and kind of just share some light on the delta thc market what to watch out for what some things are good to buy and what some things aren't good to buy and obviously we have tons of videos explaining these things but just some things to watch out for like having good quality flour like be careful of the disposables you get because sometimes they get runny so be careful about keeping your pocket keeping them and things like that i have had oil run out of the pen onto something i was wearing or something like that so definitely be careful with that and when it comes to first i talked about the edibles and when it comes to the edibles um keep a drink close by because that cotton mouth gets real it gets real sorry if i've been talking kind of fast i try to make sure i get all the information in my normal style is to more just lay back chill out just make a video but i want to make sure that i don't stretch the video out too long so people can get all the information possible i know people's attention spans are very very short so guys these are just some things i wanted to share with you i'm not trying to convince you to buy delta 8 or not to buy delta 8 is definitely a very viable option it's a product that i personally enjoy but cbd hemp library we were created to kind of warn you guys about what products you should buy and what products you shouldn't buy um and that's kind of just what i'm trying to give you a general guideline for so when you're looking for quality products last time i talked about terpenes today i'm talking about just what is quality and what is not quality and if you don't have a quality product some of the reasons i name today may be the reason why obviously cotton mouth is something that can't be helped you're just gonna have to keep some water close but these are some things i wanted to point out to you guys um so guys i definitely appreciate you hanging out with me i talked about delta thc talked about the flower talks about the vapes talked about the edibles if you guys have any questions about delta hthc please feel free to reach out to us dm us email us we can get you answers we can tell you about the products we tell you about our products here about other companies products we've tried so many so guys i really

Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "gA_u309IDA8": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing an avatar or avitas cured resin a cartridge all avatars as far as i know are single origin extracts and they make um distillates cured resin and live resin carts and pax pods as well so they're super high and super high quality from what i've seen so i haven't tried one before just do the price tag but i've been wanting to try one for a while so here's here it is and i'll give you a close-up and then try it out and let you know what i think [Music] let's try this thing out and read it um talk about it so forth so this is made by avatars which as i said seems to be a pretty high-end brand i've wanted to try them for some time um the strain is cherry og which i looked into it seems to be a mix of cherry thai afghan and lost coast og which all seem to be pretty old strains so this might be a fairly old strain as well this is single origin hybrid cured resin meaning it all comes from same grow of cherry og you're not getting a bunch of different growers people's cherry og so that adds to the price tag of these carts that's pretty exciting though uh that just makes you feel that much safer with what you're getting and know this proper um the strain and everything about it really it is cured resin i opted for cured resin over live resin because i'm actually one of the probably one of the few people who i think i like cured resin more than um lime resin i like i feel like generally a more complex taste and it has more more terpenes that live resin is usually overshadowed by like beta miracin pint um limonene a couple others like that where some of the heavier ones seem to stick around in the curing process and get more interesting ones so anyways um very nice looking packaging as you can see very sharp um these are i think 40 recreationally um i got mine i think it was like that'd be like 32 med and then i got 25 off that bringing it down to like i don't know what uh eight dollars off that twenty four dollars or so i know it's like 36 for the live resin then a little cheaper than both of these for they also have ultra which i think are distillate carts all of them are single source they're all a little pricey they all look really good so that's probably part of it oh okay let's get on the back first on the back you got cherry og one gram thc coming in at 82.3 percent or 823 milligrams for a container cbd is at loq um you've got 10 total terpenes in this and um okay and then you got thirty percent of that ten percent is beta cardiophiline i guess i'll just say that um what it is of the total thing it should be three percent beta cardiophiline one point nine percent selenidine one point one percent pinene one percent limonene one percent cedrol c-e-d-r-o-l i'm not familiar with that one that's exciting um nine point zero point nine percent humulene zero point six percent alpha cedrine and then alph um zero point five percent alpha terpenial so as you can see pretty complex and also a lot more terps that you don't really see so often oh weird anyways that's someone going down the street that's cool so this was made on what is seven um march april may june okay july i'm terrible with months sorry this was made on july 13th 2020 and tested on july 15th a little bit older than the other cards i've been getting but still not old at all really in the in cards i start wearing one they're about like a year older um you got light scale labs report id they even have the report id on here so you can look up their um lab reports how cool is that um and then they got the uid so you got everything there all the general info a lot of info on the terpenes which i like and potentially more if you look at light scale labs who they run a lot of tests or a test for a lot of companies around here a lot of the good ones especially i see use light scale labs and some lower end ones we'll use rose city but i don't think there's any real like correlation uh i think it's just a lot of lower end companies have a lot of like lines and brands like mana and lovely and um a lot of things like that so they probably just use the same people usually all right so when you open this up you got this which is super cool i probably should have showed you a close-up but i'll take a picture of it and post it in here too um let's see if focusing helps at all not too much but that's all right so what it says says avatars natural additive and flavoring free no pg vg or peg which is um okay i don't know i just uh don't remember the what that stands for but it's often used in vape vape juices and whatnot that says for best results store upright at 65 to 75 fahrenheit ensure the battery is fully charged for best taste use a 3.7 volt battery not recommended for refilling okay um and then you got same stuff but in like a little picture form got full battery 3.7 volts i think that's just the cart with a little up arrow saying store it up right and then at 65 to 75 degrees fahrenheit and then you also get this interesting thing definitely will know if you ever got a fake if anyone tried to fake these because these are pretty intricate little packages so you got that which kind of holds it up oh wow i'm gonna have to use scissors which luckily i have some right by yeah it looks like you gotta use scissors to open this there's really no easy way to open that might be able to find a way but i don't really see the need to so i'll just slice that and here you are really beautiful oil in there very very clean looking i know nothing wants to focus on this but that's alright and i'll take that sticker off like i always do very nice looking looks vaguely cloudy on the camera but it doesn't look like that in real life it's very very clear so again you get a jupiter c cell high quality c c-cell very no leaks or anything like that so all good jupiter is always fitting my vessel jupiter's fitting everything i swear those are some of the best cartridges you can get all right so it says for best results 3.7 volts which i'm 99 sure is going to be the um the middle setting on my vessel so let's try this out cherry og beautiful vapor production as usual with jupiter c cells that taste is so good damn that is a good good card right there it's already one of my favorites right now that's so good just an effect on everything so far or we'll see about effects i mean but like taste and vapor production that's smooth in the lungs and everything wow that is a solid cart high quality right there these might be like my new favorites a little pricey so it's hard to grab them as often but that is seriously good so it's a pretty clear taste too that's when you get i guess i don't know if it's from like single origin or just the quality of the production or what but i mean i have no problem like getting a good taste off that very very much like you got a very like earthy taste to it i lean heavily for earthy on this one which is weird it says it's mostly cardio filling um let me get that yeah now it's kind of like a not not very spicy because all the other terps and i don't know if it being cured matters at all but it's not a very spicy but it's very like earthy not very herbal but like very earthy um and then you got some nice cherry undertones see where they get the cherry from um yes i'm just like sweet cherry tom um i would say cherry because like usually there is definitely like a berry taste i'm not quite sure what ter what terpene it is but there's definitely like a berry taste that cannabis can produce and it usually reminds me of blueberry or like rasp kind of like raspberry but it's definitely like a heavier berry like a blue or something like that but this one's a lot sweeter and like a light way so it definitely reminds me of cherry i mean you can just see the vapor production on that that is intense it's got it they got it dialed in for 3.7 volts for sure that smells so good too that just like very light cherry after like an herbal tone or i mean a earthy tone that's crazy how clear that is so you know i buy a lot of i don't buy like a lot of low end cards except for the hushes but i don't expect flavor from those but these are just a whole whole different level um i didn't think about it till afterwards but these i think 40 bucks wreck we're a half gram these are four grams but we're a half gram half rock hash rosin cards i think it's live hash rosin that goes for 45 so next time i'm gonna buy one of these i might just go for a half gram live rosin to really get the best cart because but otherwise i think solventless these are some of the best cards their live resin cards are probably incredible um but i prefer cured resin as i said all right i'm close this video out thanks for watching everybody thank you avatar for making beautiful beautiful oils and great extracts like and subscribe um click the notification i don't know if you can do that do all this stuff that generally subscribers tell you to do i mean youtubers tell subscribers to do thanks and have a great day", "iLX3UoKx3-g": "[Music] yo what is going on guys it's your boy joseph dorel is back at it with another review i don't know why i keep saying that in every video but i got used to it so whatever deal with it so anyways i just did a review on the delta delta eight thc from texas stem culture their orange peel cbd flower slash also has delta eight in it i believe uh it's definitely some very nice so make sure to check out that video if you missed it but also i got some oh this is a sticker yeah they sent me out that and i also got the paperwork uh that they sent you out so i'm not reviewing the delta eight shadow that they sent me um no i didn't get no lab results with that one but i believe you could like take i believe you can check on their website um but yeah they also sent out the receipt they sent me out well this comes with the letter to law enforcement and ups and this is industrial hemp it also shows their handler's license this has also sends you out a receipt and the lab results of whatever you order so i don't have any lab results for these they sent it to me in a pouch uh wrapped around wrapped in some uh some paper so we're gonna open this up and uh check it out because i'm super excited to try out delta h shattered i haven't tried any delta chatter at all i tried rosin i tried cbd and tac rosin um chatter um yeah i definitely love i love chatter so so this damn i didn't realize how big this paper was and uh so this is it right here so ingredients hemp fda is not evaluate this product for safety so it does have a barcode i kind of figured it did as you can see so it comes in this little pouch wrapped in i believe that's probably parchment paper or wax paper uh but yeah uh you have to break the seal i'm gonna try and open this up so this this is delta eight th oh let me show you this other side i can see that delta a terp shatter and it's called cherry lemonade which sounds amazing i can't wait to try this out i don't smell only because it's wrapped up the i don't know i don't usually smell shatters i don't know what it's supposed to smell like but yeah this is parchment paper it's definitely paper oh [ __ ] i forgot to zoom back in on me so this is the delta eight cherry lemonade shatter there that's the way it looks so yeah so damn it looks very um it's very sticky uh well it looks really cool whatever how like clear it is uh looks like it's very potent i stuck my nose on it okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna use this to be uh how did it not how did it focus out again that's weird sorry about that guys i'm gonna be using this whatever which is my go-to vaping for wax or whatever rosin whatever it is this thing is awesome i had the top part for the longest time it's a case you you're wondering it's a at most greedy this thing is very affordable the top piece the the bottom part my friend my friend gave me but this top part is about 30 bucks i got this at a local vape shop it was like 30 bucks on the web and the website too is about the same price or maybe a little bit cheaper and dude this is awesome because it comes with um inside coil stainless steel whatever surgical steel which is like very durable easy to clean with alcohol um i use unscrew the inside and you just replace it if it ever like goes out or it gets too like dirty so that's the cool thing about it you can just keep using it so on the in the bottom part of this whatever i could put my whatever in there so i could like you know have a little extra anyways this is not a review for this but yeah i'm just laying out what i'm using in case people are wondering i know people are somebody's gonna ask like how much you get it before or where'd you get it or what's the name of it so i just wanted to knock that out real quick so i'm trying to find something to grab this with okay i needed like a little two and i have like two of them somewhere but this one's actually meant for that uh but first i think it's a little dirty so i'm gonna have to burn this little piece out sorry guys [Music] i got that i gotta throw this i have all this trash here all right so yeah i burned that because there was some stuff on there probably when i was cleaning out my pipe but i'm gonna get some of this shatter [Music] yeah it's very sticky um oh wow that's like very sticky okay hopefully hopefully that works i'm gonna try it out let's see if it works [Music] foreign i think this would be i think this wax would be very good on a dab rig uh just so they could grab it and just stick it in there with this thing it's uh it got stuck to the sides a little bit but i think i got it right in there so i got it in there so i think we're good but yeah that first hit was very nice it's very uh i said um sweet um i don't know how to describe it's very nice so it's very like a like starburst or something like that it's very sweet wow that's a that's pretty strong i forgot how this this thing's it heats up pretty quick let me make sure i got it i don't know if i got everything in there and probably melted down into the bottom yeah this thing like this thing like way i could describe this shatter it's like very sticky like a like a very thick honey or um or syrup damn it actually hit me hard [Music] okay i can't if i had to take another hit i'm going to be on the floor because this shit's strong very potent delta a i believe the shatter and the edibles you got to be careful same thing with like a thc whatever take too much you're out of there so delta eight it does get you high without the anxiety or the you know the paranoia it's very nice ever i like the i've been liking the delta a lot especially when they add terps and you know make it very flavorful because if it's pure delta eight it's really like no flavor at this one company sent me i won a cart delta was becoming very popular um and there was no those there were no terps so i made it very plain but this one is very nice definitely get that cherry lemonade um very sweet wow try and get my composure all right so i hope you enjoyed the video guys shout out to texas a m culture make sure to go check them out on instagram and their websites on their instagram i unfortunately i can't post any links because youtube doesn't allow me to so i

going on youtube fam it's looney coming at you with another video as you guys can see this is the mask i was talking about that field gave me when i purchased a cartridge shout out to field dope mask appreciate it really nice so this is what i reviewed last video if you guys weren't aware definitely enjoying the product not talking about that one we're going to go ahead and be visiting a brand that we have uh already came across on this channel which is friendly [ __ ] farms excuse my language but we last time we uh had a little rodeo with their cured resin absolutely hated it and now we're going gonna go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt and go ahead and try their live resin their actual live resin this is going to be the smoothie with a z total thc is coming in at 76.49 total cannabinoids at 79.86 so it's not that much uh not that much of a difference between the cannabinoids and the thc only three percent difference uh less than two percent in cbd packaged on 8 24 expires on 8 21 2022 so this is a it was a package relatively recent i already cut the box open just so i wouldn't have you know struggle with that on camera but obviously i haven't looked at the product yet they're a little saying you use it you know you deserve this i hope i do i didn't deserve the last one definitely didn't deserve the last one uh anyone that's not aware with friend uh about you know of anyone that's not aware of or know of friendly farms they're all true spectrum the whole live resin the whole real deal that's what they claim to be i'm gonna go ahead and see what their cartridge is looking like i've never had their live resin cartridges my first time so i've never had the strange smoothie and oh that is beautiful that looks nice look at this guys look at this beautiful live resin oil really nice they did a really good job so all right off the bat it's looking a lot better than the cured resin uh was looking smells really good like it smells smells very like uh very cannabis-y which it should you know it should smell like the smells smells real dab dab like it smells like real resin like real like resin is what i'm trying to say though obviously it's real resin but it smells like real like real resiny wow let's go ahead and take this garlic cookies off and attach the new and new one since i took this uh where was that little rubber piece damn so let's go throw it away idiot so i wanted to put this rubber piece on this cartridge right here on the bottom since i'm not using a cartridge no more that way to put it away keep it protected i highly recommend you guys to do that save those rubber pieces and use them all right screw it on this is the smoothie i have no idea what the crosses are what makes smoothie if you guys know go ahead and comment and let me know below i'm gonna go ahead and take this down to 2.8 because right now that's red is 3.7 blue was 3.3 plug oh no i don't want to preheat it one two three as green as 2.8 and they recommend you hitting you smoking vaping their product at anywhere between two volts and three volts so don't go above three don't go below two is what they're saying pretty much oh i'm so excited guys friendly farms i love their packaging black and yellow beautiful box packages is always nice they always have a they give you a little pamphlet with a bunch of random information on there if uh you guys can check out the other video on the gmo you know i'll show the pamphlet off doesn't really tell you much it's just pretty much re regurgitating what it tells you on the box that's pretty much what it is i'm going to try to get an aroma from this you guys already know the deal try to get aroma try to get a see if i can smell anything and taste anything before i vape the product let's take this off to do that i'll be honest so right i'm already having high hopes for this live resin cartridge and the reason being look at the headspace their headspace reminds me of ursus ursa has a lot of headspace just like theirs not a big deal but pretty much what i was saying is uh before i interrupted myself is most live resin cartridges most cartridges in general i don't get a very strong scent or aroma from the from doing this from the tip before vaping it this one excuse me this one has a very strong scent like i can smell it it smells like it smells like purple it smells purplish like it has given out that purple scent like so like a purple punch kind of scent wow all right that smells really good i'm actually wow this smells really good it has me kind of like wondering how it's going to taste you know cleanse my palate let's go in for it it's going for a pool cheers guys you guys got a friendly farms with you or any other cartridge you're smoking with you comment below let me know what you're smoking on take a hit with me and let's let's go ahead let's go in for this ride guys wow really good wow forgot to mention it's a hybrid really tasty wow tastes straight like a dab it tastes like it tastes like a purple smoothie like a weed purple smoothie that's oh lung expansion is there very intense uh cerebrally and um the relaxation the mellowness on the body is kicking in wow yo this this shit's uh this is uh some good ass [ __ ] this is some good ass [ __ ] oh my god that wow this isn't even my first smoke of the day either guys it's like it's in the afternoon for me right now probably 4 or 5 p.m right now and i've been smoking this garlic cookies uh you know i was i hit i hate it probably like three times today you know twice in the morning and then once in afternoon and so it's not my fruit this isn't my first smoke of the day not my first high of the day but it hit me as if it was like this smoothie live resin cartridge from friendly farms already from that initial pool from that initial hit already is better than his garlic cookies and garlic cookies is my favorite strain but i would rather pick up this this is more potent than this this is 82 percent this is 79 no this is 79 cannabinoids this friendly farms 76 thc 82 thc but this smacked me more than this did so whatever that means i don't know it might be just how potent the strain is but wow that was uh that was a very amazing surprising good hit excuse me all right let's go ahead and uh go for another one let's see if i get the same thing oh excuse me guys wow this thing actually uh it hit my throat uh my throat so you got me lit already hit my chest harder than usual usually um i can take these like nothing all right let's go go for another one that hit i said it's a hybrid it's an indica this is an indica but it hit me so hard in the head that i thought it was a hybrid wow so let me try to explain this to you guys the taste it tastes like something purple it has that very strong purple taste to it has a very strong live resin tone to it at the end upon exhale after you're finished hitting it you get that dab like that resin like a sensation like you taste it and then it's super smooth but on the exhale or rather on the inhale it hits you it's like a meal kicking you in the chest out of nowhere wow because it's smooth going down and then when you go it's like whoa you know it's like oh i don't know where it just hits you as you guys can see there's no bubbles it hasn't really gone down and uh and uh hasn't really gone down and uh the oil hasn't really uh decreased this has me faded guys you guys need to pick up this smoothie this smoothie um live resin from friendly farms you guys need to pick this up you guys need to pick up a friendly farm live resin in general this um ran me uh 60 bucks but and then with taxes it takes it up to 73 which kind that's like so much but honestly i see why the product is so expensive just because the quality is really there like it's this is some [ __ ] that i can literally hit one time put it put it down and i'm good i'm good to go just one hit is enough and you guys see i got the smoothie right i'd even mention but i'm about to i got another one coming for you guys hey this isn't uh sunset uh sherbert sunset sherbert i seen uh so this is smoothie which is a one i've never tried but sunset sherbert in a live resin cartridge four gram i can't wait to try that for you guys that one is uh coming in at 82.45 thc and 88 total cannabinoids so i'm gonna review that one for you guys uh probably after the ursa one after the after i review the ursa one but that's coming up so um in terms of what i uh expected from life from the friendly farms i'm not gonna lie i thought i had i didn't have high hopes for their live resin because i for some reason after trying the cured resin i just figured that the cured resin was gonna be similar the cured resin was super dark it tasted like straight soil like straight plants and oregano like like it even it almost it faintly tasted like weed but it tasted more like the soil that the wheat is planted and it was crazy i've never had any flavor like that in my life that's probably why i dislike this so much excuse me but this on the other hand this is like this rivals nug this beats field this kicks field right in its ass this is up there with ursa this is high quality good cannabis that you should be uh definitely consuming if you're somebody that that's looking for you know the top-notch [ __ ] the you know top-tier [ __ ] wow this um they had strawberry banana i almost got that one but the only reason why i didn't is because they had two different strawberry bananas one was a collab version which was friendly farms collabed with humboldt's finest and that that strawberry like a banana live resin cartridge full gram cartridge was at coming in at 90 thc 96 total cannabinoids and for some reason they have another strawberry banana but it's straight up just friendly farms and like like just like these just strawberry banana friendly farms and for some reason that live resin was at like 80 thc and 88 cannabinoids so so since it didn't have the most potent one i didn't grab it but i picked up this one instead and let me tell you i'm not disappointed whatsoever this [ __ ] exceeded my expectations and i'm looking forward to definitely trying the next one but let's go ahead for another hit and so i could uh describe it a little more for you guys because it does i see why it gets the name smoo smoothie because it's definitely smooth like it's smooth but then again i'm taking some fat ribs guys so that's probably why it's hitting me so hard and why it's uh hitting my chest so hard but let me take a normal hit and see how that goes wow so a normal hit like that you won't even feel it like it's so smooth like nothing absolutely nothing the taste it's hard to tell on the taste because those two fat ribs kind of have my mouth all like like not it doesn't feel like resiny but it's definitely like like i can like it's just smoke like you know you guys you guys know what i'm talking about after taking a hit that's what the water's for all right so i didn't get much flavor from that hip it was a small hit so let's take a big hit uh [Laughter] oh [Music] sorry guys sorry for any headphone users that crank up the volume wow that brought me to tears okay guys that uh what i just did there how i took three fat ribs i clicked the button three times i'd never do a blinker i like to do bigger hits than one blinker wow i also believe blinkers will eventually deteriorate your battery but that's besides the point anyways they got the cartridge uh kind of all warm and [ __ ] which i would expect but wow wow so normally i'm able to take three hits like that normally three hits like that and and blow out the smoke and i have a problem this had me choking as if i took a dab off of a rig that was insane i've never coughed like that off of a cartridge a cartridge what and it's not my first smoke of the day guys this is crazy i like i'm not ever reviewing another cartridge unless it's my first smoke of the day but i didn't want to hold i didn't want to put this video i didn't want to wait you know to review the product i was so excited to review it so i just got got to it but wow this [ __ ] is uh not only is it potent it's smooth it's tasty it hits the lungs at the same time of being smooth you can choose if you want a hit that's going to kill you or you can choose if you want to hit that's going to be smooth and you can go on about your day no problem all you got is just all depends on you taking a big hit or taking a small hit i'm hitting this at 2.8 volts any lower would be so much tastier i could only imagine and yeah you guys will probably could could uh so some of you guys have seen my other videos could say yeah why didn't you bring out the ursa uh ursa battery for this uh cartridge the reason being because i want to review that ursa battery using the ursus cartridge how it's supposed to not only that but they do say on friendly farms doesn't say on the box that you can use any voltage between two to three three is the max so 2.8 should be like if not perfect like you know if i would assume to 2.5 would be perfect but 2.8 is like you know two two below zero point two below the voltage uh limit so i think that's right around where you would want to be if not a little lower but i definitely would want to try this on a lower setting i probably will when i'm reviewing the ursa cartridge after i'm done talking about it reviewing it and doing my full review about the ursa i'll probably take a hit of one of these uh friendly farm cartridges uh probably most likely this one because i might have this one uh available to hit so i'm probably gonna try this one on the 1.9 volts and see how it is but so then this 2.8 perfect perfect hits perfect vapor production clouds i'm medicated as hell but i'm able to speak this is weird this is an indica for some reason i'm so faded in the head that i thought it was a hybrid so that's my that's another thing to say where in one of my other videos i mentioned how indicas and certain indica certain sativa certain hybrids certain strains affect everyone differently so even though this is labeled as an indica it's affecting me like a hybrid because i definitely feel relaxed i definitely feel the body sedated i feel my legs almost numb like it's amazing but i also feel extremely faded in the head and behind my eyes and right here in my temple area so it's very cerebral but in this very uh body height too it's very couch locked like they would say you know that's very it's definitely a couch lock i took three big hits so uh that's probably not going to be the normal dosage that you know you guys are probably going to be doing but if you guys want to experience what i'm experiencing then i would recommend to do the same thing take three big hits but i want to know comment below what you guys think about how my hits are because my friend uh my partner he always looks at me he'd be like damn do you take some big ads no wonder you run through your cards i don't feel like i run through my cards but let me know what you guys think about my hits are my hits normally or my head small do you guys take bigger hits do you guys take smaller hits like let me know what you guys i'm just curious is something that you know a little high thought but in terms of this cartridge man there's no complaints nothing i can say they can do better and i love the the tip the this tip is way better than this plastic tip that uh field has the this tip is perfect like you get like it just feels everything about it looks better feels better and it's just better quality the oil viscosity is perfect like it moves slowly very slowly like barely like exactly how like live resin would move is like it can uh hit it's crazy because it's like you can't watch it move up but as like i'll look away and then i'll look a look back a couple seconds later and then you'll see it uh at a different spot excuse me let's go i'm going to take another final hit for you guys wow i'm really enjoying this this is a big thumbs up i i i wish they had you guys going to hate me i wish they had this cartridge as a gmo and live resin instead of cured resin all right let's go for this final hit hope you guys enjoy your day like comment subscribe and pray for your boy wow this is the smoothie friendly farms you guys need to

[Music] [Music]", "aEaoDC2EwM0": "it what's up guys it's your boy master blinky back again with another video today what we're gonna be taking a look at is this live East Coast cartridge cart I haven't really seen these around before I recently got one and I've been really excited to try it for you guys it says that it has one point four percent CBD eighty-two percent THC and six percent Terps I like that it has the stats like that and they actually seem believable real cards shouldn't really test above 85 percent if they have Terps in them um and having some CBD in there is cool too apparently it's supposed to give you forea um and give you an energized mood and it's a sativa hybrid so yeah let's go ahead and get into this card so opening up the cart we pull it out and we see that it is AC cell atomizer with a white ring on the bottom a lot of people says that that means that it's a fake atomizer but I also want to think that maybe it's because live rebranded at C cell atomizer they also put their logo on top of the mouthpiece which actually looks pretty legit not gonna lie so I'm hoping this car actually hits pretty nicely and tastes good as you can see the bubble is actually pretty slow it doesn't move too fast at all so I'm definitely definitely having some high hopes for this cart so let's go ahead and get into my first puffs of it alright y'all so I'm gonna take my first puff off this live mimosa cart I'm using my C cell m3 battery because that's the pretty standard battery that most car companies will sell with cards so either way let's actually check this card out Cheers [Music] okay feels very smooth cheers again [Music] when it comes to the potency of this cart I am already feeling effects I'm already seeing the flash very weird it looks like a star in my vision taking that blinker straight looks a bit rough on my lungs Matt go lie well I'm sorry I feel very warm as well I think I'm gonna be a fan of these cards oh of course I can't give my full opinion yet I always want to wait at least a day to tell you guys if these carts are good but before I go for right now I'm going to be taking a hit out of the damn cap so Cheers [Music] but I tell you that this part feels a little different um it's slapping a bit more than I'm used to not gonna lie like I'm for sure gonna take a night to review these and then tomorrow I'll tell you guys that these are actually yes but as of right now I'm like a hugger home it is just [ __ ] awesome all right yeah I'll be back tomorrow B's all right hey guys again I forgot to record a hit from the CBD [ __ ] battery so I'm gonna do that real quick I already preheated all we got to do is hit it Cheers this card produces such thick smoke oh my god bro also what you hear in the background is me about to record another gaming video in case y'all are kid get hip to my gaming videos they're actually kind of funny like what the [ __ ] are you doing also subscribe to the channel if you're not subscribed and leave a like I'm really high right now I love this cookie I'll get back to y'all tomorrow see it alright hey what's up guys I'm back so I've been smoking on this car for two days now and I think I'm actually a fan of it so after two days I've only used around 1/4 of my cart which is really good on those TKO cards I two days I was around halfway done this I definitely still have a good amount of uses out of as far as the highs go I don't think I could honestly get over 10 hits of this thing without having like take a break for a bit because I was just too tired or too high when I say too tired I don't mean like this car put me to sleep or gave me a headache or anything like that it's just after 10 hits I was like way too far gone to even know how to like actually function it was pretty awesome not gonna lie another thing about this card it's starting to get a little cloudy which doesn't worry me a little bit but I tried to do some research on it and I've been seeing that some extractions or like some people who extract their own oils end up with levy oil - and I don't know if that's something to do with the plant that they start out with but it has something to do with the extraction process but either way I'm not tasting anything odd that the current hasn't become harsh and it hasn't become less potent that's something that I do notice with other card brands that I've tried at least like dab was TKO sometimes even dank vapes sometimes after you get around half to two-thirds of the cart done they start to hit a lot harsher and then they sometimes change color actually with that with the dr. zodiacs bait card I reviewed the bottom of the cart started to turn a little black from where the atomizer was so those are signs that I look forward to seat bag carts versus this one which actually does feel like a quality and good kart I massage with it a little bit just to see if like maybe the wax is getting a little cloudy because of it just sitting so maybe after heat it up a bit it'll be fine so I'm gonna take around three puffs on it and then I'll do a wrap-up Cheers [Music] [Music] just a little - coughs from that but very nice vapor and very good flavor on it I forget what I said it tasted like last time I'm gonna take another hit right now just to see you again but it definitely does still have a very consistent flavor cheers again [Music] I really can't get an actual like opinion on how this car tastes it's so odd because I really can't like pinpoint the exact flavors of this cart I know that it had a around 6% turps in it so that's probably why I'm not getting like super strong flavors versus like other cart brands where they actually use like flavoring or they use a lot of Terps and that's why they're very runny this car isn't runny at all it's actually very slow-moving and it feels like it is I really think that's why I'm not really getting super strong consistent or super strong indescribable flavor simply because distillate doesn't have flavor um I'm gonna go ahead and hit it out of a rig though and see if that helps Cheers [Music] [Music] all right so we got a good amount of calls from that hit but I'm not gonna lie I don't know if y'all have ever smelled play-doh like if you had a little cousin who like played with it around you or you have like siblings but this cart tastes house this cart tastes just like how play-doh smells um I don't know how y'all will take that I think it doesn't actually taste that bad I'm not gonna lie but I've also never eaten play-doh so if anyone in the comments has tried play-doh go and let me know if it tastes good either way if I had to give this Curtis or I would give it an easy eight out of ten the wax did end up getting less cloudy once they eat it up a bit so I think that that's not really a sign that I'm gonna be worried about if I should be let me know though but yeah this card gets an 8 out of 10 potency easily a 9 to attend this cart is amazing I don't need to hit it a lot to get high it lasts a while um and the wax feels quality when it comes to taste I'll give it a 7 to an 8 out of 10 because I cannot really exactly describe the way it tastes other than how play-dohs smells or however I described it in my first it's a bit the atomizer is a real C cell so it tastes good it hits hard and you get good hits out of it versus seven tens which I don't think hit as hard overall I have never heard of live East Coast cartridges before getting this one but after getting this one I would put these above tank vapes or even kingpins king pens in my opinion are a bit overrated this is what a cart should actually feel like if you're buying it especially off the black market this is amazing so yeah 9 out of 10 this cart is great it's consistent and I would definitely suggest it to y'all if you see them around you um good job live East Coast cartridges so I'm in the video with two blinkers from the CBD 5 battery if you guys enjoyed the video

you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it

"lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone

super tired right now I'm about to bed a little bit it's like almost 10 o'clock I think um so I'm pretty tired yeah I've heard me a stressful day I don't know why I was swing very overwhelmed and it frustrated today so I started out doing a lot which I don't think like help that building out up and then I just got so frustrated that I just like stopped doing everything for the day which then was a little bit more frustrating it was less overwhelming but more frustrating because I wanted to get stuff done but oh well also I'm sorry to hear weird background noise I had my windows open to like kinda get some fresh air and it sounds like someone on my road is like leaf blowing or something I don't even know which is really creepy though because I live like on a private road on mountain 115 acres so like usually here during the day like power tools and stuff from so my neighbors for that goes through the forest but that guy said it's 10 o'clock at night now so that's kind of weird uh-huh but for today's video let's jump into this I am gonna be smoking one of our raw CBG quiz CVG pre-rolls I only tried the CVG the CVG from vaping it so we're gonna see if I get any different effects I have smoked actually quite a bit of THC whoo sorry um part of it appears to takes like I said I was really stressed frustrated and overwhelmed so I said just really if you know and dole to myself in some THC today because I just um but yeah I'm going to get ready for bed super tired my back is still messed up which sorry um I'm going rafting tomorrow so I hope sit in the back is it too bad I've been telling you guys my back is fit enough stuff for like two months now I think um yeah I don't know I think it's a popped out rib which sucks but I got some cupping stuff done yesterday hoping that it would kind of just help around it and it did help but it still hurts really bad it's a very sharp pain that like takes my breath away if I move too fast or like moving over your direction so my hopes on it this is gonna help okay so let's get started you ace your thought that's super-creepy like it was something a chainsaw but I'm like I'm sure it's not a chainsaw what's up I didn't like it's not headaches for a while but you see if they can fix this I stopped this for myself the green roll wrappers that's a lot better okay yep mmm yeah that's a way better actually so that's good the flavor this might be seeing like some flavor but it's like it's almost like sweeter and like fruitier than when I baked it which is interesting it's definitely that harsh on my throat but like I said in the past it's not like an overwhelming for me it's not but I think obviously like you're gonna have a harsher effect from any kind of like joints or blunts or pre-rolls reading any fat versus they could be babe so that's I think is a given so really tired like I said some could like Spacey but I'm already feeling I was having a lot of anxiety today I was very short of breath and I already feel oh so sorry I already feel like that's relaxing that which is why I'm yawning more now because like I felt like I was still overwhelmed and like stressed and just having in like anxious today then I was just like going going going even when I wasn't doing anything which is an exhausting feeling as a lot of you know so I think that this is like calming that now and now it's like catching up to my body but I've been feeling like that so still feel the pain and like my back it is it's not like absolutely terrible right now which sometimes it gets so bad that I just have to lay flat on my back and like not move because it's just like an excruciating pain that I cannot deal with I need to get it like checked out more then yeah I don't know it's just a lot do you think it's a like popped out Ram but you can't really do anything for except for they let it heal they can't push it back in or anything but I said it like they do like regular bones or like other bones so that sucks and I think that because it's happening it's like causing I don't know if this is really not this I'm just thinking of myself that because I've been having it for such like two months now that it's kind of like affecting my muscles around it and because every time happens I sees that up and like yeah so I think that's having some effect nothing like the CBG yeah I can give a fan of this look oh so sorry you guys I looked up some of the effects of CVG and I mean this is just from like some research I have done this isn't like you know got a doctor or anything to me personally is that it helps with like inflammation and pain and stuff like that so that'll be really good for what I'm dealing with right now to help you with that because they need this I think after this almost like lavender and my diffuser or like smell nice and the windows open for my hey right now Alison that's bloggers that lovers of my favorite I've loved lavender it's amazing they're just a shuttle missile so that's really awesome um yeah it is just super soothing and calming enjoyable oh I'm so sorry guys but honestly I'm not because I I'm glad to be tired it's a good feeling yeah especially when you've been interests and stuff and like going going going it's so nice I feel like relax nothing tired the CVG is definitely helping that so that is great that makes me really happy you think this is honestly one of the ones that's helped me the most with me anxiety because I'm not even kidding when I was saying like I was getting so anxious that I was like getting out of breath and so then I structured like it it helps to like hold your but not really hold your breath like take a deep breath in and hold it for like a few seconds and then let it out slowly which sounds weird but it just helps you catch it and I saw if it's doing that for the past hour because I think I definitely feel like going waste smoking this I think that's why I'm yawn anymore because it's kind of just like who you guys are me yeah it's not then it's a good feeling so happy my dogs right now they're both just like passed out and being so good as I say that one moment show himself of course but all right I'm going to take like two more hits of this and then we're gonna call it good I am definitely a fan of CVG right now though brought my water again which I need to have water when you smoke a joint or something it's like I said you do get that kind of course effect on your throat um okay so like I said everything's Ivy today it's try stupid overwhelmed that CBG definitely just helped a lot I'm feeling a lot more at ease my body is peeling awake it's like finally relaxing um yeah I almost feel like this almost like kind of a buzzing now throughout me just because of how like how much people calling him right now and I think because I was just like I said it going and going you're going inside but that's just helped a lot so that's really awesome um my back kissed not hurting right now so that's really awesome as well which means I need to read for this video so that I can go wash my face and get in bed before any of that wears off because then I'm trying to go to sleep um yeah so that is it for today have a great day you guys I will talk to you later um check that was up CVG if you guys haven't I think it's really awesome definitely one of my favorite we only have the one strain right now so go check it out and that is it for today guys I will talk to you later be safe have a great day or a great night whenever you're watching this and the Seabees leader okay", "pKfDiX-2pVE": "YouTube what is up they

"NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "bVzGx2sC1j8": "all right so we're doing a review here of select elite live and what we got left of it really and this strain was cherry a Kay with lemon tree and I thought it tasted great tasted way better and then select regular carts the hardware is still the seesaw m60 which is the plastic see so I prefer the glassy sell but which is the th - but still this is good it still performs well taste is really good strength is pretty good what do you think about it yeah I think those really good yeah how about strength and just you know to compare from stuff from the same week would you say kanji is better yeah we just these kanji just came up the other day and these were 2 for 40 and of course these were at a different location even different state these are at the dispensary and I just thought that was better than the Select alive and I thought kanji was better than a lot of the cartridges we recently had that's really an excellent quality thing but just as a comparison if you happen to hit the to slightly live compared to the West Coast cure live resin which one did you like better you liked this bed in the West Coast care so we got the West Coast cure live resin and yeah I would say like this better a little bit too it's a it seems a little bit stronger right yeah taste is pretty comparable maybe taste barely a little better but strength seems to be a little bit from out more pronounced on that and so I'm go ahead take a hit that saw and see if it's on yeah really light and smooth huh and the effects were energetic and you know this is another thing like this is 94% THC but we had a car early that was 80 that was better so it's like the THC percent is not everything but I've noticed is the icing carts in the 80s tend to be the best there's some of the great ones in the 90s usually the 70s ones do feel a little weaker but I feel like the 80 seems to be kind of like the sweet spot for the right mixture of things for the most part and this seems good you had another Daggett half-life resin I mean it's good it's just not the absolute best I think the strength on the distillate the the effect the hit the stone eNOS was a little more in the distillate have you tried the Select leave distill it Stan I thought the the silat there's a little more stony than this one but especially people to like them additional effects they tend to like the live resin more so select live great product not the absolute best not my absolute fave buy resin I would say better than the West Coast cure live resin MPX live resin was better use live resin was better and but it's still a really good product and I think it's better tasting their distill it but I think they're still it is stronger and still one of the strongest ones out there so that's it anything to add would you give it two thumbs up yeah me too alright thanks for watching and you'll have a great week", "ivRTpxFMtmE": "so what's going on guys we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on another kart the venom X this one is the pomegranate paradise sativa so with uh with that intro already done let's go ahead and let you guys know that this channel is a smoking cannabis channel only so if you're not 21 and older 18 and 21 depending on your state you can't watch this video it's age restricted or some some some I don't know I don't know YouTube doing me dirty with this but sorry so well now we can start the review like I said so it's the pomegranate paradise it's the venom X this is the first venom X we've reviewed on the channel I did like a week or two ago have two venom X's they were actually the same exact one they were supposed to be different but the girl gave me the same ones for some reason so that was whatever but I just didn't make a video and I explained why in another video so go watch that one um but this one I don't think it says anything about like what percent it is oh no it does this is meeting with 100% all-natural terpenes C cell technology but bought 85% - you see right there in the middle marade there we got it on the doctor's odx battery here it's pretty well charged when I was when I got this it was supposed to be like really fruity that was supposed to be the flavor like a fruity kind of earthy taste but after hitting it for like the last few hours like a day like I've had for a day I notice that it's very very cush it's just straight clutch taste so if you like those go for it but the high on this thing is probably the happiest ha I think I've ever gotten out of any car especially or out of any sativa especially any card this thing just smacked me like in a good way and I was like fully chilling the whole time but I just felt really good I was in some good vibes you know I'm saying so I got like hair they're mangroves if you guys like sativas um and you really want to get like a really good happy high like feel great moment I highly recommend this car venom X pomegranate paradise it is solid for that I haven't felt that that like great high in a long time and this one definitely did it so let's go ahead and take one one good couch off this bad boy and yeah let me know if you guys are smoking anything down in the comments melesa interested to know so twos guys yeah I mean it I I will say there is like a little bit of a fruity taste maybe like pomegranate maybe a small hint of it but it's very cushy maybe a small hint of erythema like that that like weird you know the taste I don't want to say it's earthy but that's how everybody describes it but y'all know what the taste is but it has a little bit of those too but it's mainly cush to me that's at least my personal taste you guys might taste a little something different right sorry to me here like little noises in the back I just got a puppy I'm fostering and he's a little Brad so it makes a lot of noise I mean when yeah this thing's I'm already feeling a little little hot and body I already for sure head high a little a little bit I'm gonna feeling chill you don't here's the wax it's a really nice golden color beautiful background huh 10 out of 10 it is pretty solid they're pretty thick pretty damn thick no there was a deal it was a to 440 the homie uh-uh he the big the big homie got ice play with me so we went 20 20 and he got a cart shoutouts to him you got the same cart and I don't know how to say let's just shoot you another one guys cuz that's all I can say Oh yo so real quick so it's October right Oh in September Jesus Christ but it's September so it's almost Halloween to you that means that Halloween serials in season Nash it's the best so let me know which one's your favorite there's like Count Dracula or whatever the chocolate one a cocoa dragon track you cannot what it's called there's Franken berry and then Boo Berry let me know which one's your favorite I'm personally a Franken berry I think Don's left I think I was like tops for sure and then boo Berryman choco vampire [ __ ] whatever told mm-hmm but that's just me that's just me those are some bomb-ass cereals oh for sure for sure well well [ __ ] there is a little bubble right there and one thing I have noticed after hitting it when you do create a bubble like that inside the card it kind of hits off that bubble again so you kind of get like the weird battery like fume taste so it's kind of ideal if you can let the bubble move a bit that would be I that would be a bad deal but if not you know you can still get a pretty decent draw off it for sure for sure well let's take another one you choose yeah you know what I want to do for you guys I want to do a for one of the strings Saturdays or screen Sundays or whatever it is his move his battery's getting all my little one well for one of the streets after it is do like a Keith pre-roll or something like that like a full like Granberry Keith line or like a 3.5 grant that would be dope the I I'm not really ever smoked a chief joint at all I don't even know if Keith blunts it really made it often but I'm more of a joint kind of guy anyway but definitely man wow my lungs right there I definitely really want to smoke occasionally they look so fired or a moon rock a Zodiac moonwalk one of those those pre-rolls are expensive but I'm definitely found if you guys lend me one and see one of those I gotta find a dispro that hassle near me but I'm sure that'll be pretty damn easy I think that was three is that three yeah well I think yeah here she I'll kind of show you there's the bubble right it's just it got bigger it didn't like Oh to any other one I don't really know if he can do that maybe if I switch switch it a little bit if I open it a little bit more like not so tight no I'm saying it might be blocking a little bit of airflow let's see well I wasn't I feel like a lot more smoke and normal for sure Richard Oh ma'am that was interesting I don't know if I that was a good good idea or what I just I've always had it pretty tight so I just kind of loosened it so there's like a little bit more air fall but enough connection to get a hit yeah definitely hearing more air flow going through for sure well what interesting I'm gonna mess around with that a little more see how that works and see what happens there but I think that's a wrap for this video guys I hope you guys had a Wow Jesus Christ I am stupid I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did go ahead and give me a like or subscribe that would be awesome comments are always dope I always reply to all of them you guys are super dope on all the last ones you guys pretty much left comments on every single one except for like one which is totally chill for me but yeah I love to love the feedback so it's always good to hear with all that done and like for kids there's on them feeling feeling a real nice here real nice so I'm probably gonna put on some music by about some games or you know YouTube whatever maybe but yeah I'll see you guys in the next one deuces have go", "i2oILPARGUQ": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddies cartridge video but a buddy's cartridges that i have not tried before this is cherry pie and uh i had a choice between gelato frosted zin squirt or cherry pie and cherry pie had the highest terpene profile so i figured you know since i haven't tried it let's do this video i also picked up another buddy's wax as well but that will be for a separate video because i feel like it's pretty special so first off let's show the cherry pie no i'm saying and we got the buddies so i'm excited to try this in its own video itself but yeah you know i had to pick up today so when this says d and s it means diamonds and sauce and if it says these is diamond s sauce you know i'm saying so that's how to read that so let's get started oh by the way this is 32 out the door uh not bad and as you can see the turret profile you could pause if i'm going too fast guys but as you can see it says 11 percent and the the most prominent terpene is carophyllene which i it shows like the fruits that it's found in so i think it's grapes so very nice cherry pie oh that so let's just open this so we got a total cannabinoid of 77.59 with the thc being at 75.19 so about 2.4 extra cannabinoids whether it be it's not cbd because there's zero of that so it could be you know cbg cbn all that stuff doesn't say though but you know what i'm saying got the stuff on the side and batch id as well all that good stuff so for those of you who don't know buddies are ceramic coils you know what i'm saying but the downside of buddies is although it is cheap and high quality it does not last as long as your other cartridges you know compared to a nug so we're gonna be using the totron in today's video shout out to you guys oh by the way i'm actually outside habit right now because after this video i'm gonna get hungry about to order some food so you do see cars i am in the parking lot right now so i just thought i'd let you know but so before someone [ __ ] says some [ __ ] well they're going to say some [ __ ] anyway you know what i'm saying but bam here it is it's all all it's glory very nice oil very amberish but very nice let's get a thumbnail maybe like this hopefully it's getting it adjust it and put my face in the middle or something something so like i said we're going to be trying it off the towtron and let me know if you've tried the stream before and let's see if i can actually find my what's in here i was like did i just lose the magnetic adapter for this video like how the [ __ ] am i supposed to do this video so got everything off let's just screw on this shouldn't be too hard there you go let's drop that bad boy in all right cheers boys it's a very earthy taste don't taste grapes like the the terpene profile says but cheers again oh kind of tastes like that um that moxie art kind of like vegetable like weed type but very refreshing in itself but very similar to other cartridges i've tried it's a very earthy very vegetable taste but this one has like a slight sweetness towards the end which is pretty enjoyable but nonetheless not as good as other buddies cartridges that i've tried but not bad not bad and at the end of the day 32 for this you know it's on the lower end of a gram cartridge price so fairly uh fairly good for that price so cheers i'm gonna take another hit and uh let's just see if it tastes different i guess i don't know cheers like i said not bad and this was manufactured uh september 23rd of 2020 so it's still pretty fresh it's about two months old whoa that's quite the hitter very interested to see what this looks like and how this tastes but uh yeah you can see the terpene profile is not that big on this one so i don't know but nonetheless a very good cartridge from buddies not the best that i've tried probably on the lower end of the buddies cartridges that i like but still enjoyable nonetheless i will be taking one more hit for the end of this video and hopefully you guys enjoyed it you know what i'm saying and let me know if you've tried this what your opinion is on it it's very uh floral not floral but like vegetable [ __ ] earthy type of taste with the sweetness towards the end but cheers oh that's a shame the battery just died [ __ ] all right well you already know my opinion of it that's i mean [ __ ] i have no charger either but hopefully you enjoyed the video nonetheless just another buddies cartridge video i know i've been doing them a lot but it's only because i like it and i've been spending my own money on it a lot of people are just like you're always doing buddies or buddies but it's like dude if i like the product and it's affordable you're gonna see me buying it you're gonna see repeat on repeat on repeat and it only it speaks volumes about the product itself you know why would i continuously spend money on this you know what i'm saying like it's not something that i receive for free i've to this day got nothing from buddies and i'm okay with that because it's not about that it's about pushing good products that i myself would enjoy and spreading the information to you guys you know what i'm saying and whatever it may look like to you you know i'm pushing buddies a lot or whatever just know that i'm spending my own money so like yeah that's all i got to say other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out guys [Music] we always [Music]

back to you alright Kristina thank you very much well", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already

coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video if you learned

cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "yeTp-8aHP5Q": "[Music] youtube what up your boy cushy here make sure you hit that like subscribe ring that bell we got the new select cartridge it is white sour and we are going

it off and put on the TK old cart let's go oops and go I had to take off the little rubber piece I'm just gonna put it on my other cart just so it doesn't get like dirty and all that they're gonna I got that all put the new one on focus there we go it's not really focusing whatever I turned her off back then I'll turn back on there we go let's see first fat they're killing me I wasn't even sure if it was hitting it's hitting but it's hitting sitting very weird to be honest I don't know I don't know I don't know why to and wait though there's like zero smoke coming out of this I don't know if I got a busted cart what but this is not very good right now I mean some smokes coming out by there's nothing made this videos gonna be short because it's not I can't really hit this like I know the person like close that got me this I'm just gonna have him give me another one because I mean I don't know it's not really hitting that much and you said that like a couple of them weren't um working correctly so decided for one's busted just let him know and he'll give me um like another one so that's straight ahead that'll be in this picture right here nice boat on the TKO there we go that's a thumbnail picture right there so I mean I don't want to say we're done with this one this video I don't want to be finished with just that the form in the video 3-minute video I'm just gonna put on back on my cookies cart smooth that for a little bit just talk almost drop down so I'm just gonna put it back in the case now I know every box like it's like different there's so many different types of details um I guess I'll just depends I don't know so put the cookies cart back on and this oil on here is so I'm trying to get it's so thick because I've had this for like I don't know three weeks and I hit it every day and it does not die let so many people hit it like it's really super thick and lot of smoke comes out so it's pretty good I was pretty good most probably one of the best ghosts I've done to be honest freakin Lippert I like a little cutter something I'm newnode it from but I guess okay I don't even talk about nothing really yeah so uh let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know what type of battery guys use I always say it I just like to know because I'm more looking that cooler batteries come on that - beep um you keep I think that's the name here's the box I don't know what happened on my desk guys babe you keep pretty nice think two stories and then here's the back and then I have just well yeah it's a pretty nice battery small it's not like I've seen the key batteries I think double the size not the best that's mean in the video thing guys for watching subscribe leave a like comment do whatever if you guys haven't already I don't start giving some activity on this channel I've been gaining subs and I'm having fun so yeah and you guys watching she didn't sign me out peace", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you

you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "Zo5jiigf_JM": "So I've come to public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na

He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "PAk3eXM8VhU": "guess for starters let's put some water in the bond hey guys so today we are going to be sitting down and doing our second edition of flower versus concentrate the strain that we are going to be looking at it's going to be Girl Scout cookies or gse depending on where are you buying it from and what the hubbub about Girl Scout cookies versus GSC is I suppose the only reason I say that is because today somebody was just telling me that there has been like all of this hubbub and legal matters was surrounding the name Girl Scout cookies because I don't know trademark reasons Girl Scout cookie reasons I'm going to be sitting down and talking to you guys about the strain as a whole and talking about its effects in flower form and concentrate for him and then we're gonna choose which one I like better as a hybrid Girl Scout cookies is a really great middle-of-the-road strain great for the afternoons if you want to just hang out on the couch or if you're kind of indecisive but you just want to smoke a bong and you might get up and do something later I personally enjoy Girl Scout cookies most when I'm about to sit down and watch a movie and just kind of do mindless stuff for the rest of the day though again I do definitely like it as one of those strains were like I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna smoke it as if I'm going to be lazy and not do anything for the rest of the day but if for some reason I end up having to get up and go run errands or you know do something I'm not totally groggy and like in the couch from the strain I feel like Girl Scout cookies is one of those strains that has a very familiar look and smell to it like like when you see Girl Scout cookies and you smell it and you taste it you know it's Girl Scout cookies umm GSC just has this really vibrant green and orange look to it it's pastilles are very very like fluffy and orange and Girl Scout cookies is such a like sweet almost like fruity scent which is kind of funny because when I think of Girl Scout cookies I think of like thin mints or dozy doats but it totally does have a very like sweet fruity candy almost like aroma it's taste does kind of represent that sort of fruity candy taste but it definitely does have more of a cookie taste I guess you could call it so the parents trains of Girl Scout cookies are Durbin poison and OG Kush which are two strains that I've never had a chance to try before so I always find it interesting to come across what the parent strains of some of my personal favorites are and just to see whether they are strains that I'm a fan of or that I've even tried or heard of GSC has kind of made a name for itself in the medical marijuana community as being a pretty popular strain for just everyday stress and depression as well as it's been known to be a really great just body relaxing strain as well as like total mind relaxing as well so like I said Girl Scout cookies can kind of be in any time strain I personally like it in the afternoon however I can see it being a really good strain to start your day with a fewer person with super high anxiety or maybe really manic depression on days that I don't have a big to-do list Girl Scout cookies is definitely on my breakfast menu so in Flour forum I would have to say that Girl Scout cookies is one of my favorites overall I mean it just has a really great look a really great smell and a really great feel to it it's definitely one of the more popular flower strains on the market I have noticed as well now that we've covered the flour part of this video let's get right on into the concentrate part of the Girl Scout cookies I have transferred my concentrates just into this little oil slick because it's just easier to contain them than the packaging that never had provided so Girl Scout cookies as a wax definitely for me is different than Girl Scout cookies for me as a flower I noticed that I'm definitely a little bit more able to relax with the Girl Scout cookies flower like I could probably fall asleep whereas the concentrate form of it is definitely a little more upbeat I notice I always find it interesting how depending on whether you get a strain in flour or concentrate it will definitely affect you differently or it definitely affects me differently I notice I've definitely heard some people say that they think Girl Scout cookies has a sort of diesel e or fuel scent or taste to it I don't really get that in the flour however I definitely do get it in the wax form I feel like in the wax form it also has more of like a desert flavor versus like a candy or fruity flavor GSC is one of those strains it's almost like a triple threat between the way that it looks the way that it smells and like it's After Effects of smoking and using it um like I don't know I just feel like it's such it's such a common strain and it's just like hit home for so many people and gotten on there like top three favorites I definitely prefer the wax form of GSC for more upbeat things versus the plot the versus the flower form where I definitely would use that for more of like an evening on the couch or you know like I don't know crafts or something I can definitely see myself using the wax form for an afternoon yoga hanging out with friends or you know just kind of getting some light work done around the house nothing too major nothing that I need like a super sativa for but all right I'm gonna have myself one more dab and then we're gonna have to choose which I like better the flower or the concentrate form of GSC and today we are devin on our xlb glass rig that we got in seattle this thing is like I was just shopping cases before I was sitting down to record this video I'm so excited at the beginning of this video I really did think that I had my mind made up already whether I was going to like the flower or the concentrate form of the GSC better I mean I really really thought that it was going to be the flower I'm like I think you know actually I think it still is going to be the flower form of the GSC that I like better but like that dad really threw me for a loop like I'm blown away right now I think that the flower is going to be the winner winner chicken dinner of this flower versus concentrate episode with you guys I guess I'll call it an episode it's our second episode I feel like Girl Scout cookies for me in flower form is just like a really great end of the day kind of like melt away the stress of the day kind of just sit back on the couch and watch an episode of something and just relax the wax form was just like phenomenal I'm still just blown away by how how incredible that dab made me feel so that's always like something that I'm going to be keeping right up here thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you get a chance to try the both flower and concentrate form of GSC or Girl Scout cookies however you may like to call it and I will see you guys again for another episode of this hopefully it'll be a lot sooner than it took me to get in this one after the first episode which was the arcade a train wreck but alright I'll catch up with you guys later feel free to subscribe if you have not ready give me a thumbs up if you have not already put some words in that little comment box if you have not already and I will see you guys

doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good

"welcome to a community cannabis review today I'm gonna be making a quick little video nothing too in-depth I mean making a video on a brand of concentrates and cartridges we have here in Oregon called hush brand they're a very very low end bottom shelf here's the sticker that I was able to take off see that $16.66 that's med taxable Eve's like 20% here so comes off to $20 out the door for these cartridges this is a package you can you get them with I get with them rather hard to see towards detail there might be able to focus it perfect so I used to not get these because from I I could have sore they used to use non cannabis derive terpenes which I am NOT a fan of I don't trust them personally but ever since I want to say about like six months ago there was a nationwide and Oregon also had its own flavouring band for vaporizers and this also covered cannabis products as well apparently so ever since that happened you have a couple brands that were lower end but I usually didn't get like hush Mojave because from what I knew they used non cannabis derived terpenes it's not the case anymore so these are I'm gonna give them an another try to see what I think this is UK cheese how it comes well pretty standard card packaging they're got a rubber caps on these end up it in the vessel when I started on two point seven volts it's a really nice flavor kind of neutral it nothing stands out really but it's very nice I don't know if that's true that UK cheese I've only had one cheese straighten and it wasn't UK cheese but it does taste like that strain I will get at that I didn't expect the terpenes to be on point but I really think they might be no bad I'm gonna bump it up to I believe 3.7 volts now give it one last hit if I can get my vessel to work there we are I don't know how to work this thing sometimes I mean that's a great taste I'm really surprised for 15 16 dollars for a gram that's really nice it's surprisingly nice so calm I'm gonna do another one of these videos here in a second on Mojave this is a live resin cart that well you know I'll get to that in the video so hope to see you on that video and I'll see you next time on community cannabis review", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you

connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out

to include its speed precision and flexibility you probably have questions and may wish to see more so will follow with a detailed step-by-step guide to the installation and operation of our new 810 hotshot systems for openers you're looking at the number one reason you need our hotshot 1500 speed at the rate you're now watching you can fill this entire tray of 50 carts in a few ticks under 2 minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point zero 1 reason 3 flexibility use our Hot Shot 1500 to fill any oil viscosity use it to swap out batches mid-run use it to quickly and precisely fill almost any style vape cart pen or syringe speed precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously demonstrated and use supplied socket drive to remove valve model 1500 comes with replacement valves so look for one in the kit screw into place tighten lightly with socket drive replace tank reprime system is described previously and continue filling procedures finally here's how to replace a lower valve remove tank as previously demonstrated using Philips screw bit on the 61 tool in your kit unscrew the 90 degree bulkhead on front of the injection arm next use the hex wrench to loosen the two screws on either side of the arm and slide injection arm straight out using the six in one tool without the screw bit carefully unscrew the lower valve reverses procedure to install that's all there is to it as mentioned early on our new cool drawers Hot Shot cart filling systems deliver the speed precision and flexibility you need to achieve optimum profitability from oil product lines and here's something else to consider if you're like most current 810 users you have at least one filling system gathering dust on your shelf because it just flat doesn't get it done enough you've tried the rest not ordered the best the all-new cool jars a 10 hot shop tart filling systems available in two models at hotshot cool jars calm right now", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you

those cbd crystals um like i said they have a whole bunch of different products obviously we got the cbd crystals but cbd also comes in the tinctures isolate they have pet stuff topicals let's talk about this bad boy first real quick and let's look at these crystals oh my lanta baby we got some little diamond action going on this is very nice oh my goodness that smells so delicious 850

delta eight now delta eight comes in either carts disposables tinctures or as you can see here we got a nice little gram of those girl scout cookie dabs baby now i'm not sure i don't think this is

big old noggin out of here these are some diamonds baby those are some delicious smelling and looking diamonds holy cow banksy jesus louises all right let's take a break real quick and let's go over um delta h obviously most people know about what cbd is but not a lot of people know what delta 8 is so like cbd delta 8 is a cannabinoid similar to cbd or delta nine um delta eight is actually an analog of delta nine meaning uh it's very similar but there's some noticeable difference differences um the biggest one is the lower psychoactive potency delta 8 is supposed to be about half as potent as delta 9. i believe that's what makes it actually legal it's not supposed to really get you high but it does for some users produce like a euphoric effect euphoric effect sorry um but some of the very uh similar differences sorry some of the similarities between delta 8 and delta 9 is uh it will still stimulate your appetite stimulate sorry i cannot speak right now it will still stimulate your appetite reduce nausea and soothe your pain but the best part is it will not give you anxiety and there will be no paranoia so it's like the best of both worlds my friends gotta love it let's just take a look at these again i want to compare this we got the little diamonds oh my goodness those terps and then the crystals we'll leave these open banksy promise not to get your cat hair in here look at this this is some top notch high quality stuff here people we got the cbd crystals and the delta eight diamonds damn becky that stuff is beautiful holy cow the smell coming out of this these jars right now it is amazing okay moving along this is something new for me honestly i did not know too much about cbg before i started working with this company um but guess what my friends we are all in this together learning new things every day um obviously we've got 900 milligrams of the cbd crystals the skittles shittles whatever you want to call them um but guess what stop right there we're going to do a little education on cbg real quick first of all silver owl has cbg crystals and tinctures available and the big thing about cbg is it really works well with other cannabinoids most importantly cbd when the two are combined together it creates uh what people refer to as the entourage effect meaning it elevates the response of the endocannabinoid system and the effects of both both cannabinoids are much more noticeable when they're together so when they're all working together uh they're all you know helping each other increasing the potency the effects all that good stuff that's one of the main benefits of like full spectrum cbd is you're getting everything minus you know that delta nine so very nice stuff here but enough talking let's get back to this little jar over here and i'm dying to see this i'm sure you guys are too dying to smell it here we go my friends oh we got some powder powder dang oh my goodness people i wish there was like a smelloscope or something so you guys could just smell the smells coming out of these bad boys oh my goodness this is just too good to be true my friends all right now last but not least on our list here we have some gelato like i was just saying here is a nice little combo of some cbd cbg uh 450 milligrams of each excuse me and like i said they work better when they are paired together which is exactly why this is a little combo pack here let's just see what we got here my friends gelato oh we got some more we got some more oh we got some more goody goody goody goody goody this just leaves me speechless i feel like an idiot i don't even know what to say but oh my god this stuff looks so good jesus louises my friends let's compare the the two these are supposed to both just be isolate they look very similar but definitely still different holy cow people the quality of this stuff is amazing like i cannot believe this like we gotta get a close-up on all these my friends like just look at this we got our crystals oh my god we got some diamonds just look at that stuff just look at it oh we got the isolate this is some top notch stuff my friends gotta love it all right everybody you know what time it is this here is our final haul boy i am truly truly excited about this one today we've got a lot of great stuff and we even got a big surprise that i was not even aware about uh we'll get to that in just a second but as you can see here my friends we've got a little bit of everything uh starting off we've got our hemp flower babe as you can also see we're finally in a little bit better light so let's just open this up and see if we can get a better look at this let's look at some of these nugs here huh truly not bad looking at all if i could grab one of them you know this is some pretty good looking stuff not bad at all my friends um i forgot what the strain was called already but if we look over here it was called uh oh double owl i ripped it but yep it was called double owl got some nice hemp flour if i do recall correctly on their site they only have two strains available right now but you can buy anywhere from a quarter ounce all the way up to a pound so gotta love it my friends that's a lot of that's a lot of flour but okay moving along look at this we have four grams of concentrate here my friends they are all different um starting off with number one here we've got that key lime pie hitter those 850 milligrams cbd crystals let's just get another look at these bad boys huh super nice looking stuff very very very excited for this cannot wait to try that out um same with this the girl scout cookies baby that delta 8 hit hitter we got a whole gram of this and boy if i remember correctly there is just a huge diamond in here just a huge huge if i can get this open diamond look at that thing gotta love it baby oh my god in the smell coming out of this one jeez louise uh moving along we've got those cbg crystals and then this is definitely more of like isolate powder um still some really good looking stuff look at that baby mmm very nice very nice smell to it and like i said the cbg uh pairs very well with the cbd and that's exactly what we got right here my friends that gelato 450 milligrams of each in here and the smell coming out of this one too jesus just some bad mfn stuff very nice my friends very very nice definitely one of the better hauls i've gotten especially for cbd delta eight this is probably the best one i've gotten so far and now guess what my friends if you've been keeping score you're probably like wait there's a whole

"8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah

[ __ ] Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days", "dU9NVR4mOx0": "[Music] hey everyone today we're gonna be giving you a list of our top five oil cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if you found this video helpful and leave us a

and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it

anybody you sometimes you struggle with content that one of release really good content so it's just been a few minutes since I release and stuff today's video I get a lot of questions about is what are we going to do with your leftover carts and we get a lot of these you know questions about these cartridges there's so many of them there's a bunch of different ways they connect together and really but it's really quite simple you can definitely get inside the carts even if there's a lip just a little bit of oil less than that we want to make sure we're using all that yeah this is a very expensive program and using all your medicine efficiently is really what's going to make that make or break it one month to the next without further ado you're gonna need a few things so I got what I did is I put a hook up excuse me a couple different cartridges together just show you different brands who we got here we got standard forms brand cartridge we got GTI brand cartridge and then we have a Terrapin brand cartridge right these are simple they just screw off they're not hard I'll do one for you right now this particular one is GTI and you just squeeze here and rotate righty-tighty lefty-loosey real easy to way to remember don't you get that off that's your trash this is what you're going save now some of you might be wondering what in the hell are you gonna do with that that that's gonna be worth my medicine there's a got a lot of things you can do you could soak it alcohol you can soak it in warm dump MCT oil or like tonight what I'm going to do tonight is I'm gonna heat up a little bit of high fat milk on the stove and once it's up the temperature I'm gonna drop like no no like 10 of these and there mix it together you'll start to see the milk turn like you know an amber color if you use the llars or the co2 carts how about them light tint to it that's your indicator that nicely you know this is already smoked up you know and you just kind of stir it in there you know not overheat this is something we made out of so it does get warm so it's okay to begin something that is warm you know you don't want to go ahead and throw them in the milk turn the milk on high and boil the cart in the metal together I don't recommend that I always heat up my milk and one for my milk is that temperature which is just slightly similar in our a little bit of bubbles I'll go ahead and throw it in there I'll mix that together add a few little bit of a chocolate then I'll mix that together but that's in a different video we'll do that specifically for the other brand cartridges like let's see we got here like your moxie carts or your LLR carts yes Koecher tangi whoa love it best corn ever and then you got your where these that's your outage this is your another one of those Cresco carts as well all right so we got that banks are you know what to say in a christelle cart this is actually a grassroot cart so these three carts here have compression fittings and this is why you're going to need these two tools and the two tools I'm speaking about today it's just like pair of vise grips pair of needle-nosed that's all I'm going to show you how I'm going to take this apart let's move this camera down here to see these guys are able to see what's going on on the table alright so once I've worked with a lot are these crest coats like I said kosher tangi you know sorry everybody all character changing is my favorite cartridge in the whole program it's amazing if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you check it out we're gonna want to do this right where that strip is you're going to get that in your vice grips now if when you initially put that down there I can't squeeze that it's too tight you don't want to squeeze it too tight so then you're just gonna loosen this up which is gonna allow you to lock that end see that and without holding it it's gonna not fall out and we want it to not be able to be wiggled either because if this is you can wiggle this that means it's not tight enough even if there's a little bit of play in there we want to make sure you got as much tightness as possible you know without squishing it okay so that's how that's going to look and then you can try a couple different ways you can put it on here and just work your way back and forth slowly but surely you don't want to squeeze this metal piece here bat metal piece if you squeeze that a bunch of times you're gonna make it hard for yourself I come out here or what I do another good trick is to stick your needle nose inside there put a flap down on the table and just give it back and forth little Wiggles stabilize your base of your car just so if it becomes an issue you can get it out what I like to do is increase the tightness on the court remember you don't want to squeeze you don't want to squish it and then and as you can see I'm squishing the crap out of the top of that but sometimes that's what's needed if you just wiggle back and forth boom off cam your piece and as you can see the end is good and I squeezed out of there and now I can gain access to all my compression fitting carts with all my medicine in there and that's what that end piece looks like I know you ladies are gonna ask me where I where I got this sweet little robber thing for the car actually a buddy of mine and 3d printed it for me my man Eman you're the man dude thank you so much that's awesome all right so just dump gonna do one more a couple one more here with these twisties just so you can see it up close just kind of twist it that's it if that has a bunch of stuff on there you can even throw that in just don't throw any rubber in and buy rubber you'll see like that sometimes I had this little rubber piece or they come on the bottom you don't want to go thread up and there don't kind of get in your way I know another one of the carts that have a big problem is these Moxie carts I'll do one more of these just to show you squeeze it right there clamp it down stick your partner map there we go squeeze the crap out of that hmm actually the moxie was easy easier to get often the crest Gallic has like it's like a little rubber piece so it just kind of flexed off on me which is nice that's pretty cool now you just kind of repeat this process until you get a bunch of carts opened any stuff you can move away from the top you feel free to do so but all that hot liquid is gonna get inside these carts so you can just leave these open like that and believe it or not there's another thing you can do now I don't recommend anyone just doing this but you can definitely get one of those extractor kits with the hollow needles and just suck up as much oil as you can honestly this is I've did that before this is still the best way I've ever figured out how to use my empty carts it's very efficient people are gonna ask me what's your dosing size generally when I do this I'm doing this on a Saturday or day I know I'm gonna have off I'm gonna do about five to ten carts that have a little tiny bit of oil if you get one like especially the standard forms ones oh wow I caught that you see how much of that is up there that's a lot of will right so maybe on this batch if I have something that has that thick that much oil at the top caked on there I might drop it down one or two carts just cuz I know it's gonna be pretty strong that day you know and then you know like I said I'll be making more videos and I want to definitely make a video on how to actually put these in some form of edible or drink and I will definitely be doing a video that in the future so thank you every much everybody thank you for watching take care of yourself and each other and hang loose", "KdpVntWyFOk": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com here today with special guest justin cures what's good doing a west coast we tour review featuring the buddies brand forbidden skittles liquid diamond live resin one gram baked cartridge i'm excited we've got a buddy's brand vape battery it's going to be an exciting time now the cool thing about this particular west coast we tour review is that justin's review his score is going to be the official review score for buddy's brand why i work for buddy's brand so to be fair and unbiased you're up i need you to be extra tough you're on camera always honest with you i know you're always honest stay honest okay i'm not paying you there's no money right now i've given it's a 6.5 all right here we go but be honest so what we're working with here is the one gram cartridge see we got a buddy see cell cartridge 76.7 on the total cannabinoids thc 74.61 terpenes are always listed right so buddies greenbox terpenes are always listed on the back we've got eight point two one percent on the total terpenes we've got three terps always displayed which terpenes do we have this beta caryophyllene limonene in eight yep yep which is from hops i think this is going to get me this is going to bring like that stoned uh that's like the one word that one word i think i'm like really that's gonna get slightly 8.2 woody yeah it's going to be good 76.7 total contaminants with our cartridges i always recommend a four to six long like vapor rip you if you have a battery that can change temperatures put it on the first like lowest temperature setting or the second the second lowest and you're generally pretty solid if you have a battery like this one that just pulls then four to six seconds should do you just fine if it doesn't if you pull it and your battery doesn't like do anything then consider changing out your battery that's how you can really tell it's that real deal live resin liquid full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub-critical temperatures are you ready this is real live resin nothing but no atoms this is that low temp life right here five seconds no blinkers only type of [ __ ] you don't want to do a blinker and burn at all yeah don't burn the terps all right let's see i love it clouds right there see what i was saying oh i get that taste that skittles are right off the bat man that's bomb that's really smooth really smooth probably one of the smoothest uh live residence panda i've never tried it usually sometimes i'll get like uh which one we'll call which is harshness in the background right like super citrusy vapes tend to be kind of harsh sometimes right because it's so like potent or powerful tasting right right this is the key word really is smooth light there's a piney gassiness in there like the turks kind of roast the nostrils right but then that when you finally exhale it out you get a slight citrus just like anyone you know i'm really i'm really getting the uh uh um the humeline and the karyophiline coming through because when i was blowing it out it's almost like it's like a it's like a um like a cider almost yeah it's like a right it's like a earthy cider citrusy earthy and then the woodiness yeah i really like the color i really like the taste i really like the flavor um i mean everything speaks for itself like everything is the high letting you know what it is uh right off the bat seeing the terpene profile i'm like okay this is gonna get me stoned this first hit i feel uh i feel like calm i kind of feel it in my legs a little bit what do you feel and i feel uh that indica high like you're where you get it behind the eyes you know and already making money what do you feel like behind the pressure in your eyes because that's what i'm really getting right now is just like i want a homing sensation i want to squint and i'm also like you almost could just go to sleep just puffing on this bin it tastes really really good and the high is immediate in terms of both the body feel and like a slight burst of energy as well get it out the nose just to get just to get more of those major curves and that's how i kind of like you know if that if that really like is a burning sensation sometimes i'm a little iffy on the pen that's why i was saying this one's really smooth no harshness even with that i'm not even no no phasing over here and i'm i'm stoned presentation appeal i'll think consider all these things right now okay there's a number out there i want you to marinate on it presentation appeal the color the taste the smell you can smell the turkey you want to get stone buy this banana potency more information available would you recommend it overall what are you thinking i'm thinking i would recommend this especially this strain like i would say go find this because uh two hits and i feel like i took a dab yeah two doc feel like i feel like i took a dab nice dad you know um and that's hard from from a pen to give you that such a head change so that's like really upping the score for me um and then also i like i said i really like the color on it um yeah this packaging's there your major terps you letting me know the potency uh doesn't really show me anything on cbd but that's okay that's not everything that says that happens um but you're showing total cannabinoids and that's what matters that's what matters so overall i'm gonna give this a nine a solid nine i think what would be missing is just maybe more i need to do that well that's what i was going to say just more of the information on on what like this specific strain is going to do to me what it's about and that would be it that would be it i mean everything else is is letting me know this is this [ __ ] is what it is it's fire yeah that's what the color the color is come on come on that's consistent right there so but uh i know you guys you all heard it here and also from the rosin head himself fresh as well yeah this is this is our newest drop really good solid night i tried to bring i tried to bring some the buddies maybe maybe throw some more info on there it doesn't hurt people want to know i want to know you know what's up with this

bit so let's go for rip number two tell you guys a little bit about the taste all right so that was a blinker I'm not sure that's ten seconds but it might be a five-second blinker this one's the white widow this one tastes pretty good I'm not gonna lie it has a good taste to it it's pretty therapy tastes fruity taste like mangos that's what I got off of it mango taste let's try to take two blinkers

[Music] you [Music]", "w0_1bXksiUM": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up guys back here for another video and your boys back here with another freaking cart review slash versus guys i haven't tried these too strange in so long so your boy had to try him um the homie he picked up and he's just been you know collecting a lot of cars so you boy had to you know hop on and he let me try the bezel so shout out to the homie you already know see get yourself a homie who got cards that you can review you feel me and try out you feel me so we got the nug and the nug is a big sur it's a live resin and then the bezel it's actually called bezel i think i said bezel earlier it's actually called bezel it's a sauce cart and this one is actually i think higher in terpenes and stuff than this other cart and it's actually it's also um made using butane actually i read it on the side in their ingredients but it also says it's high in terpenes so we're going to check that out see how good it is it's a a disc chill it with terpenes basically turns it into sauce i guess but the other one is more of a live resin so sauce versus live resin you kill me but um let me give you guys a close-up this is uh what the bezel comes in like a tube comes in a pretty big box but they only sell uh half grams so if you guys are in the full grams you're probably gonna end up having to buy two they haven't made a full gram cartridge of this yet but you know what it's all good let me take a hit before i even open up this other package hope everyone's smoking right now i'm smoking on um the rest of the absolute extracts the orange creamsicle freaking fire we're going to turn this temp up i know y'all like seeing them clouds because y'all like seeing a brother cough i let a lot of that get away but y'all saw me but um as you can see it's hard to get these shits open with one hand but it's all good the bigger one is the nug it has their little symbol on if you can see it you can barely see it but as you can see the sauce cart it's a little lighter and that's just because it has distillates and the terpenes you know it's not enough to make it super dark but it makes it dark the terpenes i'm pretty sure is what makes it darker but it looks good it's a nice little i don't know what kind of i don't know but you know it's pretty much the same as nug it's just another is a little bit darker but they're both kind of an amberish color this one's more yellow though you know what i'm saying but um we're gonna try out the nut first just because i am a nug fan over basil so we're gonna try snug first shout out to nug if y'all haven't seen um i made a video on their dispensary so go check that out um and also i did a review on one of their freaking fire ass products called thc a if you guys haven't seen that i'll try and put it in the top of the screen but don't be mad if it's not the top of the screen just go through my vlogs check me out watch it man you guys will catch a [ __ ] vibe all right cheers guys enough time let's see if i can take a blinker hit we'll see it's on a very high temp right now so i don't know if i can bam what street big sur i don't know what [Music] what freaking strains they use flower wise but it definitely has like a um let me taste it one more time guys hold on i give you exact what i think in my brain what it tastes like i don't know i feel like it has like a little taste but it's not necessarily sweet but it's definitely just like super dank because it's not guys it's live resin you guys already know that but it tastes super smooth like it's not harsh really at all you already know it's freaking it's amazing like nuggets probably one of my top live resins that i would get and one day i'm gonna do like at the end of the year when it's a new year guys i'm thinking about showing you guys all my product so tell me if you guys want that vlog showing you all the products that i did um that i smoked this year and telling you guys which ones i thought were the top best ones because i feel like in some of my vlogs i don't necessarily you know tell you guys oh this is better or this one's better because some people like different things and i want people to try things you know think for yourself you feel me because i'm not an influencer guys i i'm just gonna put that out there right now i don't want to be called an influencer if anything the thing the message that i want you guys to get is to think on your [ __ ] selves you know but um shout out to you guys let me take over here before i try this sauce yeah that shit's a hit man that's just to hit you turn the temp down and try oh yeah let me turn the temp down and like maybe i could taste it better that's facts i forgot see this is the honey stick that i used to have guys you've seen it in um vlogs before but mine broke or got stolen one of those i can't remember but hey it's almost 10. it's a little tip and we're high as [ __ ] but um let's see what it tastes like on low temp because low temp guys this is what people need to understand like yes it's cool to have big clouds get that fat head get loaded as [ __ ] hella quick whatever but it's also cool to just gradually get high and take low temp hits because you actually get the flavor of the strain that you won't you know that you're smoking like that's why it would be dope to you know vaporize but you know it's just a lot of vaporizers that i want like the volcano are super expensive because i would honestly bake the bud get high you know and then use the vape bud to make edibles or something but we're gonna try it on low temp [Music] i don't know it don't almost taste like uh like a cake like plain by itself you know what i mean i don't know if you got like just you know like pound cake or something i don't that's just me you traced in i don't know you i don't know maybe i'm wrong it has something in there like a certain taste to it that i feel like but it is dank as [ __ ] mainly it's just like a super dang dab taste but it has a taste to it i feel like what do you think [Music] dude i could taste this sauce it almost tastes like like lemon cake see i'm saying it's like a i feel you it's like lemony or something bro i'm puffing on this right now and like it tastes sweet as [ __ ] take a puff on that the sauce tastes sweet as hell when you puff on it right now like don't you think holy [ __ ] like i think this might have this might win no no we ain't gonna say that yet we're gonna say that yet hold on let's switch it up [Music] and i'm not the biggest fan of these tops because like you can end up seeing the oil there but these tops because they're circle they're good for taking bong hits you know if you don't have like the tool to smoke your boners so cheers guys we're gonna taste this on low temp because it tasted super fruity like it had like flavor to it guys so we're gonna see what it tastes like [Music] damn bro [Music] this [ __ ] is good guys holy [ __ ] i'm trying to match the flavor on this [ __ ] bro it's like um like a like i see like i don't know [Music] it's like a sherbert you guys can barely see the vapor probably because it's on low temp but it tastes like freaking sherbet or something taste it real quick tell me i'm telling you bro flavorful papaya papaya okay papaya what which one is this dude this is the the miss usa this is miss usa guys sorry i did not say in the vlog you guys probably can't see that but it says miss usa and it's an indica hybrid slash hybrid so it's a hybrid probably dominant indica or indica dominant you turned up 10 a little bit [Music] all right guys this this bezel is is giving nug a run for their money not not trying to dis nug but you have to see it like this guys the bezel is a distillate that's high in terpenes nug is a live resin so it's not a fair comparison because they don't add anything you're not you don't really add anything to librarian some brands do like um i'm trying to think like buddies they add terpenes to their live resins but um i don't think nug adds any terpenes to their live resin i'ma look at the ingredients [Music] they might have terps in it but it's like maybe low in it low in terps but um this freaking diesel actually tastes freaking fire you gotta try this strain exactly guys miss usa try this straight exactly i'm gonna take um a couple more hits for you guys and i'm gonna dip out and just chill you know gotta chill a little bit you know you know spend time with homie talk a little bit and you know maybe have some high moments some high thoughts guys tell me if you guys want to hear our high thoughts video comment below if you guys want to see a video about just my high thoughts or some [ __ ] we've been like me and the homie been thinking about it so maybe we'll just jot some things down that we said because we say some like crazy freaking [ __ ] that's just like what the hell high thoughts guys like i thought but let me take a rip real quick [Music] damn yeah this cart i'm buying this car soon i'm buying this car soon guys but um i hope everyone enjoyed this video new vlog coming soon probably in a couple of days literally after this vlog drops um finally 2 000 subs guys so i already told you guys i'm telling you guys in every video bong giveaway coming

getting me to 2000 um you guys will see that video i think i talked about what i wanted to do in that video and you guys will see what really goes down so i'm gonna take this last hit and then i'm gonna get out of here guys [Music] peace [Music]", "880TLs3fjmg": "okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to that glass and that is how that is set up right [Music]", "ZTgKBViXyx0": "youtube what is up cushy here and we have the most expensive cartridges uh in pa medical right here uh hundred dollars apiece for these cartridges uh they're one gram um but we're gonna uh open them up and try them on see if they're worth a hundred dollars make sure you guys hit that like subscribe and hit that bell and make sure you uh if you want to legalize medical marijuana make sure you hit that subscribe button you guys rock here we go so this one here i already did open uh i've been smoking on it i love it it's a great great great great sativa rhythm is a great company uh there you go picture of the cartridge from rhythm nice liquid don't move at all straight uh nice thick thick stuff throw it on the battery here like so like i said i've been using this one a little bit so i mean it does have uh some out of it but then we have this one here this is the gelato from alera this one is also a hundred dollars but they even bling this one out for you it has a golden blinged out uh cartridge and i did take a couple hits it was full so i mean it was fuller than that but i just figured i'd do uh the most expensive cartridges uh video but oil looks good it's a little lighter than the other stuff and to be honest with you i always thought the lighter stuff was better but i'm starting to think the darker is better i don't know but yep let's give this guy a try we'll flip his camera around and uh try these babies out now this one here is what i don't like you need a big battery for uh you need either a push button battery with a big high voltage or something like this a yo can to make this thing hit to its uh proper proper capacity because it has these air holes in the cartridge that are kind of a pain in the butt but like i said if you get a big battery uh it's not even a problem all right screw this on all right we got both cards hooked up and ready to go all right we'll start with the rhythm here this is lost coast travel diesel 1 gram 86 it's like almost 87 thc boom rhythm great company great cartridges they're half grams or a little a lot of head space in them this one here was pretty full i was really happy with it uh this has been three days now four days i had this and it's still a good bit left so i mean i'm liking how long they last it's really good oh whoa has a great uh citrusy flavor instantly three seconds in you feel it very good cartridge is it worth a hundred dollars no but very good cartridge love the taste of that lost coast travel diesel okay round two a second hundred dollar cartridge this is a gelato from alera gelato and then we'll give you the boom again like i said you need a good push battery for one of these so we've got the yo cam plus here make sure she's on she's on and here we go gelato is my favorite strain another 100 cartridge right here uh here we go that thing rips oh that gelato man i like it i really like that gelato i bought the 0.5 for like 45 or whatever it was 50 bucks uh this one here i got it for fifty dollars it was on sale i got it on a discount so i wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for these cartridges at all they're i mean they're worth it they're one grams but sell them for 85. come on give us a deal uh we should be 60 but then we go here this is the hundred dollar one here and uh like i said this one here i paid 86 for after the deals so i really didn't pay the hundred dollars for them but i did pay for them uh i don't know if they're on sale at a good price i would buy another one but i can't spend 100 on a cartridge you guys rock like subscribe hit that bell love you hey them [ __ ] got me dumb litter", "LfdsaO34phE": "hello everyone and welcome to my channel I am low to describe and today I'm gonna be talking to you about a product that I have here that I have been using for a little while now I have been using CBD products before and they have helped me and so I decided to try this brand this brand is called just CBD and the these are their Signature Series cartridges the one that I have right now that I am currently using is the pineapple express this is a hybrid cartridge it says so right here on the label and another one that I have been using is the is the Sour Diesel this is one of those sativa cartridges they come in this clear plastic container with like a cork top so I think that's pretty nice that they do that this is how they actually look right here so this is the full-spectrum container this is glass right here and it comes with this pretty awesome wood tip and I shall see that right there how it looks and I have been using it with this vape pen its BIOS if y'all haven't heard of that brand or I'm sure that y'all have heard of the brand it's very good very reputable brand it comes with a that you can set the voltage down here at the bottom and you can choose which voltage you would like to have it as so with me I use CBD products mostly for my depression in my anxiety I also use it to calm my nerves whenever I feel stressed out or in a stressful situation I have used Lazarus naturals before the only thing with that is with that one it kept me up at night and then I did you CBD MD and that helped me as well and so I decided to try these out since I have been tired more tired lately and so I decided to try the pineapple Express and the Sour Diesel since the pineapple Express is a hybrid cartridge and I read on there it is a 60% sativa and a 40% what's a 60% sativa and a 40% indica and they're Sour Diesel is a sativa so they have lab reports on their cartridges and they also have lab reports on other products that they do have that y'all can check out so with these with the Geist CBD brand the cartridges they have another one also so they have the sativa the Sour Diesel the hybrid pineapple Express and they also have another one called Northern Lights now Northern Lights is an indica as for more of like whenever you want to relax more of you can use it before bedtime to help you sleep I haven't tried that one yet but I'm going to be trying that one soon enough I might get it later on today or tomorrow I have to see if I have time to actually go purchase it but these two cartridges that I have here they have been really helping me out lately with giving me more energy with giving me more of a positive outlook because usually with my depression I was given by the doctor antidepressants to take but I haven't taken those yet because I would like to try more natural stuff before I actually take antidepressants so I have been doing my research on what products to take I have been doing my research on on the different terpenes on that health depression and different terpenes that help would get more energy more activity more focused and so far these have really been helping me this brand has really been helping me so far and I'm gonna try there like I said I'm gonna try there indica Northern Lights and then also with this whenever I take a hit from it it is like the smoothest inhale I have ever taken from from a CBD brand it is like very very smooth on the throat does not irritate the tro does not irritate the lungs these two that I have they come in 200 milligrams CBD and it's 100% u.s. grown hemp has a right here on the label and also it has it on their website and like I said before they have lab reports on all of their products so y'all can check their products to make sure how much CBD or you are getting how much what the terpenes are that you are getting I highly suggest this brand I bought these out of my own money so I'm not endorsed I'm not a paid by them or anything and I don't have like a affiliate link to use I have just been using these out of my own interests and out of my own for my health to help me get better and so that I can do more one thing that I want to let you know that I have talked about in my other CBD products reviews is that with any CBD product there if you have to take a drug test there is a possibility that you come out positive for THC depending on your on where you work if they drug test you or if they don't there are people or companies that say like on here it says zero percent THC I'm not sure if you I can see that zero percent THC let me show the other one actually they have recovered up but it says zero percent THC on it and so whenever it says represent THC that is 0% basically it is under the amount that's that's not legal it's under the amount that's that's detectable for THC on the lab reports that they done but there have been cases in a group that I follow on facebook called CBD oil users I highly recommend y'all check it out if y'all can but on that group that I follow they have been cases where people have said that they took a drug test from their job and they came out positive and they ended up having to lose their job because they thought the product was you know the people told them it was zero percent THC you're not gonna be show up on a drug test and all that but you can on any CBD product you can show up on a drug test because over time it accumulates in the fat cells and it also depends on your metabolism and each person is different they're having people who have been on CBD for like a year and they have not come out positive and there's people that have been on CBD for a month and they have come out positive so it each depends on the person but as for these the gist CBD brands the pineapple Express in the Sour Diesel the taste I don't know if it's just me but they taste very similar but that just could be my taste buds I'm still you know China deciphered the flavor it's they taste to me more of like floral what do you type but that's just me and my taste buds and on what I've tasted so far there is another CBD product that I have been taking that our review next time and I just wanted to show you all these these ones that I had I bought these at my local smoke shop they had a very good reputable reputable brands that I seen these were $34.99 for each one and I would think that it's worth it because of the way that they look the way that the glass and the full-spectrum is and also comes with this really awesome tip one thing that I do get to say though that I didn't like about them it could be the shop itself on and on how long they had the product or it could be the way that they are packaged but when I first bought the my first cartridge which was this one it was gunked-up at the bottom it was gunked-up at the bottom and I'm not sure if you I can see these little holes right here but they were like black and I'm guessing because maybe the CBD oil with the conduit it just got clogged up and so when I went to take a hit and nothing came out so I had to go back I got another one that looked like this like they had the black and nothing came out of that one either until we found one that was clean one that was clear and I made sure with this other one to make sure that it was clean and clear and I took a hit from those that let me test it before I took it out to make sure that the product was working well and it was and since I've got these it's just been phenomenal so me personally I suggest y'all try it out if you want to like I said next time I have another product that I'm going to be reviewing by funky farms and so hopefully y'all stick around for that one so with these the pineapple Express the Sour Diesel and then the Northern Lights by just CBD and I also suggest checking out their website I'll put the website in the link in description down at the bottom so that y'all can check it out but if you are having any problems like let's say tired anxiety the or any other symptoms that you can find on the on ano zone there is CVD that might be out helping CVD can work for you or it cannot there are lots of products that are out there and it just takes time to find the right product that y'all are looking for I highly suggest if you are getting maybe like discouraged or anything don't give up on trying the product don't give up on on find the right one because whenever you find the right one it'll make a world of a difference thank you for sticking around and listening to my review on just CBD on their Signature Series vague cartridges and hopefully I'll enjoy talk to you later", "ZarvcmhxBSI": "hello everyone and welcome to another product video brought to you by cheapest vape

[ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "_dwDGj43WRM": "hey everybody it's Jay again with a brand new video on how to fix a broken vape pen cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]",

early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "VPNksumOtHI": "in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video before before this video starts I just wanna let you guys know that I slapped on some sunscreen so I'm not all greasy and [ __ ] so if you guys want to know you know why I'm hella shiny and [ __ ] it's not cuz I'm sweating I mean I am sweaty not gonna lie I got mud butt right now but definitely I'm not one for my face you know it's just if I'm this greasy I'd never be this greasy you know man I hate the [ __ ] shower well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we're gonna be reviewing yet again another select cartridge this time accidentally you know throw in a row no a couple times where you know I had pretty much whole is gone where it's worth I think there's about like one-third of it left so it is a select once again it's the elite brand the select it's the pineapple express because he see its 85 85 percent THC so there's some good [ __ ] you know was good at the hybrid right here it's a hybrid right there so it kind of gets you a little bit of everything but here we have it everybody and like always check this out y'all check the song there you go you guys see that right there and you turn it around I see you notice that gauge that you know especially if it's clear you know I guess it's the more the clear the better especially man if you guys are smoking on some of that some of that dark [ __ ] man I see like I'm telling you guys one time I got I bought a fake brass knuckle cartridge right I smoked it up and you know after a couple days it was just turn in it was turning brown it was turning like the the oil was like really dark you know so like always everybody we're gonna turn this on we're gonna put him on the the lightest for the low temp he already knows good cheers everybody pineapple express select so if you guys watch the previous video I actually reviewed the ghost the ghost train haze cartridge with my boy Hoss you know so that [ __ ] was pretty good you know this year the Select I'm telling you guys it's the light cards man they get you freakin loaded man they get you they get you pretty lit and again I talked about in the previous if you guys want to go check that one out it's gonna be down a description it's some ghost ghost train Oh ghost train haze something like that yeah I think that's what it's called sativa so it's gonna wake you up but pretty much I was just talking about how like the flavor the flavor it doesn't have a really strong flavor whatsoever but then again it gets you super frequently like you taste it you know you know what you're smoking on you know you're smoking awesome THC you know [Music] as I was saying you know it's like the best part you can smoke this in public I mean like you know if you get the taste of it it does have like the distinct taste you know obviously if you're smoking THC so you're gonna know you know but the thing the thing that I really like about these is that the freakin smell is not strong whatsoever does not stick I'm telling you guys like right now I'm just saying this [ __ ] in my room you know it's not I'm gonna be able to open the door it might smell just a little bit but it's not gonna smell like super strong you know so that's one cool thing that I really like about these cartridges and select is some of the first cartridges is you guys if you guys know you guys were watching this channel select is a cartridge some of the first cartridges that I started smoking you know back when like you know wax pans and all this this and all this stuff was like new you know it's this [ __ ] this three alright we're gonna switch it up to blue to the middle temperature damn blue is just perfect because this again this doesn't really have like a big taste to it it hasn't it's crazy to me also like cartridges for me they all taste the same it really depends on the percentage because I know select has a couple I think it was select pretty sure I'm 100% I'm actually ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent sure that select it used to have some of these or still does but I don't know what you could get them but select has these carts that are like what like a point three in a cartridge and it's like super strong it's like high maybe like in the mid 90s low 90s I think 90 to 95 percent maybe even 96 percent who knows but I do remember there was like they're really small and you would just rip it you take one good rip and damn man you'd get [ __ ] blasted I know a lot of you guys really like these cartridges reviewing videos it's crazy man it's like the new thing right personally me cartridges are I mean I guess you're cool you know especially when you go to like family parties and you're at the house you know you want to step outside and smoke you know smoking this is pretty far you know because you can just do it work you know you're taking a [ __ ] you sit down on the toilet you're taking this [ __ ] you give you a hint in this you know if it was waterproof you giving in into the shower but you know when you're laying down you're watching the movie huge puffing on this [ __ ] but to be completely honest with you guys I get lit but it's like it's just like a head heart you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy you know like I don't get beg debate so I mean I I'm actually lying there has been a couple times where this is so spire that I guess you made it I guess faked I not believe I like this one you can barely tell it's like a little different taste these like cartridges especially these ones right here they all have like a similar taste but I'm lit man personally let me know the comments down below what you guys like better you know and you guys like either cartridges or flowers especially mean I like the flowers you know a lot of dabs and everything I like flowers I mean dabs are cool you know cuz again you can take them here in the crib you know you get super baked like dad or you just trying to get bang foot you know if it fits up if I'm starting my day with dads man all right be my date man I'm gonna just be slump I'm gonna just be hella tired so that's why I kind of wished it up you know I kind of I'm gonna start to take like then dad's you know at nighttime you know or man especially if you guys are gonna watch a movie you guys are gonna eat but it's like you know later in the day where you just don't really have nothing to do and yeah because sometimes if you died man your soul it I mean it it's honestly depending on you guys you know you're gonna go with the highest it's a bit depends on on your guys its body type like let me know what you guys get productive you guys get lazy cuz there's either one or the other bros tree and either THC all there's others only [ __ ] oh I can tell it was a weekday let's make some nice clothes but personally mean I don't like that height I'm you know I feel like it just burns through all this [ __ ] damn I thought I completely forgot what the [ __ ] I was talking about oh yeah okay so either either it makes you or it breaks you like personally me what it does to me is when I usually smoke or whatever and if it's like a sativa it's gonna pick me up it's gonna pick me up and it gets me really like creative I start thinking about you know different ideas and so for me personally me I feel like it relaxes me and I could definitely be way more creative I mean I'm already creative sober but it's like you know it's like sometimes for example like like earlier today you know have a little short [ __ ] die last night I didn't really have that much to sleep or whatever you know I don't take take a few puffs you know get a little lit and I'm just like damn bro I think about you know I started getting in my head and I started thinking and usually when I get on my head I'm just like dude I got to do this I got to do that like oh [ __ ] let's do it now you know and I take action so sometimes for me tree regardless I mean sober or this you know I'm gonna be [ __ ] creative productive but sometimes this [ __ ] is like there's days where I'm kind of like look I feel like I have like I feel like I can't think of [ __ ] or I'm just kind of like [ __ ] I'm just like chillin there you know and I'll get lady and I'm just like boom [ __ ] this pie it's just a sativa you know it really depends indica it gets me a little tired it'll also be the same but I'll be kind of like slung but there's other people who they're gonna just have a sash that I said and they're not productive at all you know they don't really get nothing done during the day they just throw the whole day around you know and I've had days like that that's why sometimes I'm just like [ __ ] man I gotta start doing that [ __ ] you know I gotta stop [ __ ] you know but again you know people do you know a lot of people look down on Chief and stuff like that but I'm telling you guys sometimes if this [ __ ] could give you literally like just a weird and blue sometimes that happens sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes I'm late I'm still doing [ __ ] but over time you kind of just get to learn how to like what your body likes like for me if I stay I like to smoke sativa all the time it doesn't matter if it's a day nighttime sativa cuz actually picks me up and I'm just [ __ ] like a machine bro you know just [ __ ] do it [ __ ] and I'm just lit out of my mind and I'm just like dude what the [ __ ] I just did all the [ __ ] you know and I'm just late I was really like it was just everything was naturally happening if that makes sense you know I don't know I'm I'm horrible at explaining [ __ ] everyone damn so liked everybody make sure you guys go check them out man if you guys the only thing that I would say I guess what kind of suck is that the flavors aren't really that strong you know it's like you you do get a flavor but when they say like for example like different stuff like this pineapple Express definitely I had like a different taste you know especially like other cartridges they throw in like a little extra flavor to make it think like Oh like a pineapple type you should hide Apple Express or some [ __ ] but you know you you just know you're getting the extract from this sharing or from some legit pineapple Express you know the book is lit man if you guys owe a good thing I would I would totally recommend this brand and this these cartridges it's like cartridges especially if you guys don't want to if you don't wanna like hotbox your room or some [ __ ] you guys are burning like in the bathroom real quick you guys have a quick sesh you know cuz the smell isn't that strong there's no like stick to it like rock gardens oh my god they have like a crazy like leafy it's it's a [ __ ] it's it's a strong a smell on the other [ __ ] you know they have they have strong smells of [ __ ] down [ __ ] late cuz I do not shut the [ __ ] up I got a chatterbox anyways you guys thanks for watching like always soon everything we have from dispensary man in Italy some flowers so

carts I crashed my eye or craft what is it yeah craft concentrates got a few different ones here today got some banana Kush some green crack one of my personal favorites lifesaver what was the other one banana I was super Lemon Haze another green crack got a few those another Saturdays I've got a few of those anyway squeeze these rotate it open that's pretty cool not very many cards for that fancy this guy it's cool but it's also like a lot of waste this is heavy duty plastic and there's cardboard on this paper and there's tips on both ends like it's a really nice package but it's also just a lot of waste anyway anyway here we go come on baby there we go alright let's get this [ __ ] open when I hit it oh yeah and I forgot these are the half gram cards they're not they don't come if they do come on full green cards they didn't have them so we got these to try you know proper open this this I've never seen I mean I guess a few of me I think can they come with these but it's nice so they can just cover back up no lint get in there nothing clearly states THC like a lot of new ones do which kind of sucks you can't drive with them and stuff with anywhere I mean you still can't obviously let's get people very good pretty good flavor pretty good got a good flavor ice a good pretty good punch man on my period my pen does a pretty good job anyway I would suggest these I got um hell of a deal it was [ __ ] there were $10 each so I was actually 2 for 20 and then I was out the door was to for 26 a gram cart for 26 bucks which is pretty good nowadays since grams are going up and buds gonna her flowers going down cuz carts are just so [ __ ] convenient everybody's hitting them everywhere anyway Bubba want some food wait and wait [Music] there's a mob of oh they will eat out of your hands and [ __ ] such a fatty I just put 20 feeder fish in here not even a week ago and you already ate them all there are decent size goldfish not little tiny Guppies anything anyway

ranging from 350 milligrams to 800 milligrams 70% THC per cartridge live resin uses fresh frozen whole cannabis flowers as opposed to buzz that have been dried and cured we have packaging here

LG delivery's org", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "BMSzf_bzJ14": "and how's everyone doing today we're gonna be doing a cart review and this one I'm actually quite excited for it because I bought this just yesterday its indica Skywalker the eureka cart these ones are really high in potency and this is coming in that THC level eighty-seven point fifty-two percent THC mg at 875 points to mg CBD point twenty six and more CBD mg coming in at a whopping two point six feet before this vapor cartridge now we're gonna be unboxing it so it is but put some close-ups on the screen for you guys I love the box here because it actually is a really nice box I don't think you just will end up to the camera really does it justice so exactly a sense of what you hope you guys enjoy this for other people we just had you orgasm you I really do you don't really digging this packaging Buddhist oh my god its packaging you don't really get that you must get them in a vial or something this is how they normally are open so foggy we are going to a he's faking his reviews these things come like this artisan so this is the cartridge here it is a clear oil as you guys can see it clearly obviously explained the title of the video yeah it's real cart we're gonna try to get on this booze penny at really trying it at three point three votes if you guys can see that they're hittin this bad boy alright alright its baby boy hopefully you guys were big along with me and it's can to hit in this car [Music] [Music] first impression all right first impressions of this really good this is a really nice strong pool I like it it's a it's a really nice pool body's pretty thick I like that adds a really pungent and same taste to it this guy Walker by the way but now already mentioned that already but um yeah okay well after those two shitty ghosts um I like said this oil is pretty freakin dank it is pretty freakin fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits me in the face when I'm just too baked and I'm really baked right now so hopefully you guys did enjoy this video leave a like comment and tell me how you guys are doing on this quarantine and yeah it's been your boy visa", "xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss

video stay tuned stay lifted and I'll see you next time", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "kQmL3zc2sOk": "hey YouTube how are you I hope you guys are having a good day and if you're not I hope by clicking on this video you're feeling a little bit better today's Monday okay and I'm back again with another cart review oh I picked up another cart that I have not tried okay I did take a couple of puffs off of it but I didn't like actually like experience everything so this is gonna be pretty exciting oh garden sky doggy and this I don't know um but this is an indica named live resin okay now I was like what is the difference between all the other cards and then the live resin like what's different about it well I looked it up online and I wrote my little notes down so I guess live resin an onion flower rather than a dried cured flower so I guess the other types of cards which are called dis lint or I don't know I don't know if I said that right but basically those I guess are made of flowers that's already been cured you know it's chilling and it's already dry so that's how they make their you know chemistry happened with those kinds and I guess what's live resin it's fresh frozen flower if that makes sense so I thought that was an interesting found the raw garden site because on the packaging you guys it has your little warning it has the manufacturer date the batch number and all that it tells me like the percentage right here on top of the sticker but yeah on here it doesn't say much it just says ingredients 100 percent frozen fresh frozen whole flower Turpin's and cannabis oil so those are the ingredients in this wax well card it says no trim no additives ever and that's all it really says and then it tells you like how to use it and the dosage you should take or whatever once you open it up so this is the inside of the box it just has like a little container where your cart sit so it's all box name inside of the box so that's cool and then in here is where it's all at and you push down and you open it sometimes I'm having trouble okay got it open yay okay so um in the thing that's what the color looks like okay this is beautiful it's so light it's just attractive you know it looks cleaner to me it feels more natural but that's just the color that's just me talking on the card of course it has a California sticker and then it has the raw garden and then it has their little symbol so on a symbol uh logo logo yes yes yes and then on the card screw on thing that you just take off once you're ready to use it and then it has a little top it this is what the mouthpiece is looking like okay that is the opening hole and then sort of those say is just you know regular white little tips screw her on and let's start this smoke stash I have not smoked today yet it's my first time yesterday I got really okay story time I got a little drunk okay and then I think I had three beers and I have well three beers and a half is too much for me I don't drink often at all rip and oh my god I was so sick you guys it's like I just started feeling really like woozy and like just tired and I was just not having fun anymore like I didn't want to be drunk anymore and I threw up like I was sitting in my car and I was just chilling first I went outside to catch some air you know I was with a couple of friends so I went outside to get some air all feeling better and you know you [ __ ] up even after you go outside and you don't feel better like the fresh air isn't helping it's not doing anything so I already knew what I was going into so I was just kind of walking around kind of like chillin then I just then I sat in my car and I was [ __ ] sick I just was like okay you know when you feel like you're about to throw up like it's coming you can't stop it it's coming it's exactly how I felt you guys I threw up I didn't throw up all over me you know I threw up outside of the car I have not smoked since then because I got so sick I came home I think I don't even think I took a shower but I laid down I slept I woke up at 12 I ate so I don't know how I survived but here I am okay it's website and I wanted to focus on some of the little facts that they have on there what they claim cuz like I said on the packaging it isn't much so I wanted to kind of tell you guys and also with the live resident another fact if focuses on maintaining is strong and pure flavor and honey I can totally agree with that because the first hit I took of this when I was leaving the dispensary oh my god like I was so freakin late I was coughing my ass off it was really pure like as far as the flavor it literally tastes like you got some like dab or like wax and you took an actual dab you know out of it Raik that's what it feels like it feels [ __ ] well now feels it tastes really good and the flavor is definitely very like weedy you know and another few few facts from raw garden so they claim they are a hundred percent natural farm-fresh cannabis so they only grow fresh cannabis they're not using stuff that's been sitting somewhere really grown plants so all of their flower you know that's extracted for their cards or their wax or their diamond saws there's so many different stuff from them it's all California cannabis grown in California valleys so if you guys you know support that I definitely do because it's like if it's a closed source it's more of it's not past past past no fillers and their product no added flavors and no additives and I [ __ ] with the no added flavors part because I don't really like the extra stuff just for it to taste better or something like I can care less but anyways I'm gonna stop rambling and we're gonna get lit and I'm gonna and I didn't bring a water what is she thinking amra all Gardens definitely gotta take little hits with this oh my god yeah yeah you guys I'm warning you okay if you guys are I'm telling you guys take little hits off of this when you first get it if you haven't tried one of these already because I have not tried this so I'm a whole new person to this you know it's a very it has like a wax taste okay like this is an indica sky doggy so do not expect a no type of light you know fruity stuff from guys like this is the flavor is like like I said I'm gonna tell you the flavor okay very very wax like that's exactly how I describe it I don't think it tastes like any type of fruit or any type of like you took a DAB and that tastes you have in your mouth but a good damn you know not a nasty not on whatever something you just whatever no a good clean wax tab out of a clean break that's how I would describe it okay had a terrible night yesterday though I [ __ ] fell asleep like my whole [ __ ] like it was turning out to be cool and I did a lot of stuff yesterday but as far as like I went to the grocery store then I went to the dispensary and then I think I ran like two more errands and that's after that is when you know somebody when I first went there I had positive thoughts I was like I'm gonna have two three beers and I'm just gonna drink I'm not gonna smoke and at first I didn't even smell them they were smoking at first okay and then you know it was fine I got drunk I got confident so but I did throw up it was fun being drunk I felt really faded but then I just pushed it pushed my own limit I knew I should have stopped when I should have stopped but yeah I mean other than that you know as far as what other flavors have you guys tried if you guys are watching this and because this should spider like I love it okay like oh and let's do that bubble test y'all like I don't think it's fake so if it comes up fast is it's it's a full gram so I feel like this should last me a while because I mean I barely take few hits and I'm high so like I said it's good it is an indica so I mean they probably have other flavors where you guys are at so it might be different stuff I don't know but as you can tell my voice is like recipe now because I'm a little high and you know this did it [ __ ] it did it [ __ ] nothing I don't know what else to really say about it but I definitely recommend it it was I think where I got it from 55 before tax and then would tax a little bit more so you know you do what you do as soon as I'm done filming this video I'm gonna go edit smoke some more you know is honestly let's do a rating one to ten what am I gonna give it once and for all it's a good 9 okay I'll even give it a 10 I just haven't smoked all of it yet and then I'll definitely tell you with an empty car to be like yeah what do I really think about it this [ __ ] hits but yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on what is your other flavor that you have tried that you recommended me trying let me know you know let me know but I'm gonna go because it is getting a little darker and I'm pretty much [ __ ] I don't know talk about hang out of 10 it it tastes like what it claims you know the no fillers no added flavors no additives it definitely feels like that it feels really like pure just Tacey [ __ ] pounds in your face baby hits baby hits you guys oh my god but I'm gonna go I'm gonna edit this video maybe smoke a bowl or whatever you know the huge the user dues but I hope you guys are having a good day and I hope this video made you feel a little bit better because it definitely makes me feel better making them and yeah let me know let me know well I'll see you in the next videos so you don't know anyways have a good day have a brighter day and have blessed day", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my peace", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel give this video a thumbs

cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "bd5O4LcaDdQ": "[Music] what's up guys I'm breathing 420 I'm back with a new review and I do not have Bank babes for a while now I ended up getting some new stuff and I'm telling you now guys this is not anything like paint babe snore like supreme cards know like any of those little [ __ ] Street carts these are actually dispensary cards and I know y'all heard of them before they are by Ben baller and they're BBS pins so if y'all seen them you know what I'm talking about look at these guys I have the three colors they have out right now which is the silver the gold and the rose gold and the strains on these are Sour Diesel animal cookies and Master Yoda OG are the three strains look Sour Diesel is the silver one animal cookies is the gold one you see that and Master Yoda OG is the pink which is the rose gold one they are at BBS or VV acecomm if you see this the boxing is really professional they're really nice it looks way better than anything I've ever I've never smoked before look at that guy's the hologram BBS and it says a higher level of clarity with the Ben baller symbol at the bottom the back it does not tell you the THC percentage and to me I think that makes it more official because and thank vapes they all have a they all have a THC percentage you see that this one is 94% THC but how or how sure are you that is 97% or 94% you know they they can't always just read like pre boxes and know that that tank is gonna be that high in TC percentage these are different you feel me cuz these don't tell you anything except on the back it says activation time immediate suggested serving one five-second inhale light indicates activation in close contains 125 servings for best results store up right at 65 to 75 Fahrenheit so that means what you have them on you don't have them upside down you should be having them standing face up like this because they are prefilled and they're disposable so that means make sure don't worry that you can just toss it away and it's over with so you don't have to endure see cell there's a new C cell ones they made so and the back it also says government warning this part it contains cannabis a schedule 1 controlled substance keep out of reach of children and animals cannabis products may can only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient the intoxicating the intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours cannabis used while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products and pairs your ability to drive in operate machinery please use extreme caution and then add videos or videos calm and a holographic paint see that guys these are way different now here comes the best part y'all ready forgive this look at that this one comes like this as well as the animal cookies comes like this too but I ripped off the thing because I didn't really like it so look at this that's animal cookies as in the gold color and this is Sour Diesel I took this one off too I only kept one just to show you but I like them more like this if you look at this this our decent one is the silver one and this is the one we're gonna be trying out today so let's see how this is if you look at it they kind of remind me of the King bun because the King pen comes in us in a box like this and it comes with something holding the the cartridge inside as well but this comes with the full battery and a CFL cartridge so it's even better for you to take it out it comes really tight inside this this kind of black styrofoam or foam that they put it into you see it it's all you got to do is put your now on the top just light it up look at this guy's silver battery BBS at the at the top look at this oil guys like it's some beautiful beautiful gold almost clear oil these do have a little bubble but that I know these are how they all come and it has to have the seal at the top guys also if you look at the bottom Ben baller son and if you see really closely this right here looks clear because when you hit it it lights up so he's gonna light up every time you inhale take the seal off and this isn't plastic this is like aluminum it's just like the battery is aluminum as well you can't unscrew the cart so like I said once you're done you dispose of it see how the first hit is guys this is Sour Diesel and I'm very freaking excited never had one of these before y'all can't tell me these aren't legit cuz y'all know where these come from so let's see how this goes Cheers yo okay tell you right now she tastes just like bud just like the flowers sour diesel it has no flavor additives to make it like Danks that they had all those fruity flavors has none of this this comes pure for the strain just broken down into concentrate and put into a vape so you're not getting you know additive flavors or no fake terpenes or Nothing you're getting the real deal this is freaking delicious it tastes piney and a little bit sour but when you when you inhale it you don't really feel the smoke coming in or the vapor coming in when you exhale it you don't really feel like you had anything in your mouth so you feel like you're just blowing air but they're really smooth they're not so hard on your chest they're not so hard on your throat you shouldn't be getting like a a nasty burn in your throat nothing like that I did have things do that to me so I had to stop smoking them for a little while these are healthier guys they are pesticide-free if you go to their page they will tell you everything about them these are pesticide-free they have passed their their um their little tests or whatever they go through so you're good on these they're healthy there's nothing wrong with them they're not gonna do anything bad to you just be really careful cuz I know these are way better than thanks so do the second year guys let's do this second here guys and Cheers stupid strongman oh oh I'm baked I haven't even smoked today this is all I and this is all I had today and I'm already good this is freaking delicious guys tell you right now flavor ten out of ten I would even give it more if I could but I scale them from one to ten so I gotta give it a ten out of ten the the high on it definitely ten out of ten I'm baked it's freaking delicious these are legit look at this I'm not even gonna flip it for you guys bubble one move that's just so thick that bubble will not move you're gonna worry about these guys Ben baller keep doing your thing I know it sounds weird VBS is actually a jewelry company just like you know the supreme cards but Supremes are fake they got nothing to do with cannabis VVS another hand burn ball I decided to get into the cannabis business and he made them a little bit fancy also you know they're not that bad on the prices so if you can get one definitely a cop stay tuned guys cuz I will be out with more cuz look I got two more to go through man I know how this goes keep smoking and stay high [Music]", "JDeOMn_ZpuQ": "yo guys what's going on I don't know if y'all notice but it's been a minute since I posted a YouTube video it's been about probably two weeks a little bit over two weeks maybe that was the last time I have smoked weed I haven't touched a blood of join edible a cart anything since that video so this is gonna be a fun one this is gonna be a great one um the reason I was gone is I had a lot of school I had to do some I was working I'm still working now but I was I was getting a lot of support on the last videos I didn't think I was planning on smoking anymore or doing any more videos but like I said there was a ton of support I'm at like 47 subscribers you guys are killing it getting a lot of feedback on some of the videos sounds like I can't just end it there I gotta keep going so yeah we're back with another cart today's car it's gonna be an indica that's gonna be God's God's gift so if you guys are excited let me know in the comments drop a like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] these channels 4:18 over 18 plus 18 whatever however you want to say 18 plus if you're under 18 well [ __ ] you can't be here but you know how am I supposed to know you probably chillin right now you little minors um anyway so right here is like I said it's an indica select elite so y'all know it's gonna be fire already and since I haven't smoked in two weeks I'm about to get dumb blasted so I'm pretty excited uh the THC is running in at ninety point four five percent here which is pretty dang insane right there lets you look at the blocks for a second and I won't focus so you can't read it but there you go it says here it's supposed to tape tastes like grape sweet and earthy so that's cool and it's supposed to give you a relaxed happy euphoric feeling so that's cool they say it right there on the box I don't have planned videos for the next few we got two of them right here if you know their colors you know whether they're in because the TVs are hybrids its blah blah blah those will be coming here pretty soon um yeah so like I said it's been a minute so might seem like a little weird of a review I'm kind of trying to get back into it trying to think of how how I did it so let's just uh let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open here ah [ __ ] so actually let me tell you because I always see hey seam reviews on whatever it is and not knowing the price so the dispensary I went to was Metro meds I here in Phoenix Arizona let's see this select God gift cart right here I paid $80 for this but it was a buy one get one basically so to 480 it wasn't a biome but they always do two for 80 deals so yeah so I got this and then I got another full gram for 80 bucks so 40 bucks each basically and then I got a eighty sativa yeah well I'll tell you guys now I got a higher no that's anyway I got a hybrid half gram here which I don't think I I might have reviewed a hybrid I don't quite remember I'll have to go back and look at those um I just was charging this pen a little bit it wasn't getting full charge and I charged it for like 10 20 minutes so I don't know that's alright though uh well let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open oh no I remember you guys you kind of got to open it from the bottom these parts because if there's some long ass fingers to get to the top for some reason and poke it out stupid ass blocks and [ __ ] blah blah yeah maybe not you know this box isn't even childproof and I can't even get through it Jesus okay there we go there we go wow it's been a minute since I have touched a cart let alone a full gram cart that is one big [ __ ] that's good okay just real quick I wanted to say this cuz I was thinking about it if I don't have a video in the next few days it's because it's gonna be hard for me to it's gonna take a minute for me to get adjusted and smoke a full gram pretty fast so I'm not gonna quit again it's just gonna take a minute for me to get this done and then put out a new one so [ __ ] I'm very excited because I mean I know it's have to give me like the craziest high in the world but hopefully it should smack me pretty goddamn well um let's go ahead and screw it on the dr. zodiacs chew Moonrock clear battery there hi you already know I like that little fine point tip better than those round ones because they get less dirty well I told you guys the type of car brand price dispensary I don't think I told you guys about everything let's uh oh except for the liquids you already know peace tea still haven't sponsored me that's okay they're gonna one day don't worry pop that open go ahead take a sip hydration break yep hell yeah man hell yeah all right if you guys are smoking on anything in the what what I guess you guys are smoking on anything let me know down in the comments I'm always excited to know what y'all smoking oh by the way if you hear any random noises like squeaky toys I brought a foster dog home again that the owners were dog [ __ ] that's another story maybe I'll explain that at one point but those are what those noises are so cheers guys oh [ __ ] you oh yeah that's that's definitely a snack you're right on the first like inhale God dang that is hole [ __ ] I definitely get that earthy feel for your version dammit dammit weird though I'm definitely feeling it already like I just thought that's weird that's weird how it hits god damn well I already like it says it's supposed to taste sweet / creepy and earthy the only thing I'm really getting out of it is is that earthy taste not getting really anything sweet there maybe I'm you know like that much sweetness that's about it so yeah you know that's alright that's alright you're not usually in the cards for for taste that's for those nicotine vapor guys sucks to beat them and they're getting [ __ ] end of the stick people are dying from these poisonings and these black-market cards and these guys are taking this the beating for it because people think it's believing that's pretty rough I kinda want to make a video on unlike the fake cards I might buy I know a few people I sell some TKO some banks and all that [ __ ] I might buy one of those in compare them I really want to do that I think I've said it multiple times in some videos but I really really do want to do that cuz it's pretty bad out there man y'all like some smoke and some boof and I mean I've done it before you know it happens you gotta do it sometimes but if I knew what was seen him down what was happening to the kids that are doing it now I win it so I just want to say if you all just look at some tanks some TKOs some exotics I was looking a lot of exotics by the way be careful be very careful try not to smoke them I know it's it's easier for me to say it to you because I have dispensary cards and all that but it's not worth it guys yeah you're not even getting that real high you're getting that synthetic [ __ ] you didn't pesticides you can ascertain E which you know that's just no bueno just be careful guys they thing's not gonna kill you if y'all are in the nicotine I'm not that's not gonna kill you vaping this stuff isn't gonna kill you is this even considered to be me I think it's vaping yeah yeah that's vaping this isn't gonna do anything it's gonna be those black market cards so if anybody's all like at school here hit my pen and be like the [ __ ] to get that homie and he's gonna be like I got it from Joe down the street at Casa de ghetto and

select didn't make the [ __ ] [ __ ] brand Jesus imma ended there guys I am posted highly recommend this cart if you can get it legally highly recommend get into my really do recommend it so kit before I ruin this video even more I'm gonna end it there be sure to like subscribe do all that [ __ ] deuces", "iiWt_oC0Li4": "[Music] [Music] what is up guys simplistic here we got be legit and we got nikki in the back you feel me and uh yeah if you can tell from the title this is a cartridge that costs nine [ __ ] dollars you know and uh someone mentioned to me to actually try it and also shout out to my boy shaka he also has been [ __ ] with these he said it's good and uh yeah we're just gonna have um uh be legit open this so i could film him no i'm saying hey definitely but yes shout out to the homies for helping me with this review all right papa or this video um papa it looks like randy's daddy [Laughter] we're gonna be trying it in my tronian battery is gelato 33 you know gelato 30 oh [ __ ] it's child proof oh no i can't open again [Music] and you said you wanted a cartridge and that's what it looks like uh um for this lit i would i would expect it to be lighter uh but it's um it's kind of got that like uh brownish tint at the very top too maybe if we swirl it around oh let me get a thumbnail with your shoe holding it from the top with the proper herbs hold on my [ __ ] fingernails kind of dirty so i'll like not get it in there there we go all right so that is the pop of herbs it does have like the the tint but i heard that's actually the the the terpenes that they put on the top of the distillery or something so you can smell it how's it gonna get smell ooh it's like a i don't know what it is as usual we're going to have the person to my left take it first yes you know then hopefully it works with this battery it should sounds like a wrist movement [Laughter] i was but they said they can have this deal for a while it's yeah well as long as it's there you know i don't think it's really a deal it's just it's just price that low because i've had this brand before guys you you know it was a eighth or i think it was like seven grams or like an eighth for like 10 bucks or something that's how cheap the flower was and that car's pretty smooth let me show you you can't really go wrong with the nine dollars unless it's off the streets of course yeah but for nine dollars nine dollars this is this is hella worth it definitely wow what the [ __ ] yeah it tastes good bro good flavor good flavor it's not like a special flavor it's gonna taste like seven dollars but with the tax yeah it's gonna taste like your average cartridge but yeah it's got a lot of a lot of flavor yeah it's a very candy like flavor yeah yeah that's not exactly candy nine dollar [Laughter] shout out to the homies for helping me but i also have the cure company you know that this you guys have been requesting so this will be in its own video obviously it deserves one right but we got the papa herbs so i'm saying ben ben's liking it you know so i'll your typical weed flavor you know it doesn't taste like weed to me it's more of a like a sweet candiness with a little bit of a pineness towards the end i would say but you know i feel like it's not gonna get you caught up as much as maybe live resin cartridges would um but yes at the end of the day for nine dollars for a half gram it's really uh a win-win you know at the end of the day like if you spend nine dollars on it and it's trashed you only spent nine dollars on it right but you spent nine dollars on it and it's good so that's like [ __ ] amazing so i'm gonna take one more hit these guys are gonna take one more hit after me and we're probably just gonna call it a video but uh i don't know if i mentioned that the back i believe it was running at 85 thc so it's definitely still wow a whopping amount of or percentage right so possibly does budget cartridge yeah falling on a budget i'm not really a cartridge guy so i wouldn't know but that definitely seems like a good throw right there would you say it's probably the best budget cartridge that you've ever seen from me uh honestly i don't remember when i hit your cartridges bro i just hit it yeah i feel it you know not everyone's gonna know as much about cars with me you know yeah because honestly some of some carts they all taste the same to me sometimes yeah no i feel it like a lemony-ness yeah yeah that's most of the time it's gonna be sativa when it tastes like that okay yeah like the the super silver haze that i had recently of buddies like that lime salt and taste yeah yeah yeah but yes uh other than that it's been a really really good product review and we've been hitting it and look at it it barely moved and uh i'm definitely gonna be enjoying this on the next coming days hopefully next coming days not just like one day um but yeah do you guys have anything to say [ __ ] why didn't i buy one you know like comment subscribe and subscribe but yeah uh subscribe like the video if you did enjoy and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music]", "jZ6x8shCQqI": "- PO Boxes you're gonna be doing a video today for you guys I really hope you guys are doing good it is Wednesday afternoon today I'm just kicking back - I was just wondering you know what do you guys prefer you live residents really hot right now really popular now compared to distillate which distillate pretty good you know don't get me wrong it's still [ __ ] fire but a lot of people been saying you know distillate get you a little bit more higher than live resin or I don't know it just depends but they say live resins way WAY tastier than distillate but this really gets you higher than live resin so here we have a live resident Stiggy what a distillate is your regular stays you know that means hopefully you guys got a close-up on the tasty percentage so one has more CBD than the other one so that's pretty interesting as well so let me know what you guys prefer a live resin or a distillate you know pretty curious about that so we're gonna see you know to me I honestly I love both I [ __ ] with distillate a lot to me honestly I love distillate since dizzy came out it's one of my favorite distillate cartridges or applause whatever you want to call it plug and play and there's just other some other distillate cartridges are pretty fire out there but here we have a live residence tizzy this was a this was a living cookies you know I did a review on it but I haven't dropped it it's just I've been really really busy you know it means daughters coronavirus [ __ ] going on but if you guys haven't noticed live resin is way darker than actual distillate is as you guys can see this little a way lighter than what a live resin is so you know first when I seen a live resin cartridge or a pod I was like what the [ __ ] you know cuz it's way way darker so that it was like one of my first times I had try live resin so it was way darker so I was like kind of sketched about it but you know they taste really really good they taste fresh like most of life resin cartridges are really dark you know dark amber color compared to like a rocker which is really light but the but the taste on it is way way different but so today we're gonna do comparison table I'm gonna take a blink round of both of them and I'm gonna hold it in and see which one will choke me out a little better to see which one will get any high so first off we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and hit this regular distillate sativa cartridge it's a Sour Diesel as you guys can see I've gotten out of my dispensary in the fake [ __ ] you know it's good to spend extra money on the legit cartridge guys you know to make sure you guys are smoking no [ __ ] so we're gonna go ahead and take a blink out of this distillate pot and I'm going to let you guys know if it's better than the library cheers guys if you guys are smoked a lot let me go ahead and do so [Music] those who know distillates dizzy pods are always [ __ ] fired the blinkers ain't as bad as a plug-and-play but the blinkers on the stasis are [ __ ] fire you know all you need is like maybe one blinker or two and you're good so the oil on the dizzies on the regular distillate they're really thick compared to a life resin after couple hits the live resin the library will run way way more than what a distillate when you know what I mean so if you were to flip it upside down after hit a night it will you know the oil will go upside down real quick so I'm feeling pretty high running off the distal ahead so we're gonna let him show you guys a close-up on the life resin one as you guys can see it's darker as I was saying so I suggest to see the California little sticker but they say you know don't be sketched about it you know if you guys get life rising cartridges and they're darker just because you got smoked rock garden and they're little lighter doesn't mean they're good you know but like rock garden is far but I'm just giving you guys an example you know just because it's darker doesn't mean it's bad but I take a hit of this life resident cartridge and we're gonna applaud whatever I just get mixed up by same pot and cartridge but we're not going to see what's the difference on it so I'm gonna take a blink row this life resin this is the lemon cookies I'm gonna see how it tastes [Music] Wow now the taste on it it's really fired to be honest the THC percentage it's a little lower than the distillate but the feeling you get on the throat is way different it's more like if you took a DAB like an actual diet and the taste on it it tastes so better it tastes it tastes so clean like it tastes like if you actually took like a DAB you know like the smell of it like you can literally taste like the actual terpene in it you know compared to the distillate you know the d\u00e9sol\u00e9e it does taste good but you do get like a little fakeness taste to it compared to life resin but it tastes pretty good you know I'm going to take another hit you know that's how good it is if you guys haven't had the lemon cookie you guys time how the lemon cookie won this one's pretty far ready going now to take another hit off to the [ __ ] taste so bitter [Music] but the light resident does run out a little faster than the distillate guys now now that we hear both of them honestly it's up to preference if you guys prefer life resin go ahead and drop a like or whatever let me know in the comments section of you guys prefer live resin or a distillate cartridge to me honestly I smoke any one it just depends you know I'm not really picky when it comes to smoking cartridges as long as they taste good and get any high as [ __ ] I'm good with that but that doesn't mean I'll get like the cheapest [ __ ] but you know I just like to try new [ __ ] not like I'll let you guys know if it's fire but to me honestly I'll [ __ ] with both but let me know what you guys preferred so now that we tried both of them it's time to abuse the share of these bad boys let's go ahead and hit both of them at the same time oh wow catcha is really good you know I see a lot of people that carry two batteries at the same time it's just one of them [ __ ] up so I had to get another one but ended up working all of a sudden so now I have to so that's pretty dope I really hope you guys stay safe out there while she got his hands coronavirus a [ __ ] so don't really want you guys to end up and catching it and nothing like that so you guys be safe out there take care of supra-conscious and you know and drop a like and comment what you guys would like to see next but peace guys", "zFiluDchhvg": "yo what's going on guys sentry

at another cart this time live carts these are a live resin and terpene cart says they're based out of Maine there there's their logo let me see if I can it's like a plant with you know drop distillate or whatever um these are based out of Maine I don't I went on there if we look at the box it says Made in Maine natural terpenes premium premium cannabis distillate then on the side there's nothing on the back on the side it says their Instagram and I went on the Instagram I just the boxes look a little bit different so where I live it's very hard to find you know reliable cards it's hard to know if they're you know what's in them and whatnot and if they're the official company so I think this may be a fake if we look at this is a destroyer and a flavor another thing I thought it was weird just see this cap to the to the tube it's like it's too big for the tube so it just just goes in there I thought that was weird but um this is a indica hybrid yeah indica hybrid strong Nana I will say the terpenes are pretty alright like um even if they are fake they the terpenes are not bad like actually tastes like strawberry banana I thought that was pretty good I'm surprised I thought this would be like you know not a not a great card taste wise and you do get that aftertaste you know did the classic street cart taste you know just kind of unofficial kind of you know pesticides or whatever but if you look we have I have a TKO cart right next to it and you can see she's gonna be kinda hard to show but on the right is the TKO and well you can tell the live is a little bit darker and that's normal but the live cars also it seems a bit thicker like the wax I don't know but um no I definitely I definitely make sure if you get these I'd definitely make sure these are legit it says Made in mean I think they come out of they're not a horrible cart definitely not the most official ever I would try to stay away from them but if you want to try them I'm sure the other flavors are good too this straw game is pretty solid but if it's a short not if it's a short-term cart not a you know pick up every time you need a cart if you want to try it out I would go for it but and stay away from them for the long term that's pretty much it thank you guys for watching", "iTGAmHipYL0": "[Music] filling and capping correctly will preserve integrity speed and cleanliness are the key for an efficient assembly if you missed our mixing instructional please follow the link to the video once your mixture is warmed and ready you will have to fill in cap quickly

sure there are no air bubbles still trapped in the piston if there is you will hear a sharp fizzing make sure to leave some space from the bottom of the cart when you press the pedal to avoid spillage take care to not overfill try to finish the entire run to avoid reheating your mixture when switching flavors purge and clean thoroughly time is crucial when it comes to capping after you fill filling

__ ] video and today's video we are trying out something new i should tell by the title i am going to be trying out this delta a cartridge for the first time if you go back like two videos then you'll see that i did a goody kind unboxing and they sent me this delta a cartridge it's actually a new product on their line their store link will be pinned in the comments or in the description down below i didn't even have a battery for this and they went ahead and sent me a battery so i was like [ __ ] yes this company is so generous yeah i'm just so grateful that they sent me this and i get to try it but yeah um before we get into this i want to explain what delta a is because i actually just now started to hear about it so i'll try my best to explain what it is but basically delta 8 is a cannabinoid everybody's heard of delta 9 but if you don't know what delta 9 is it's like the main cannabinoid and thc that gives you that high effect but delta 8 is basically just like the reduced version of that you know it doesn't get you like high like delta 9 does it still gets you medicated you know but it's not going to get you like so medicated where you're just like i'm so strong bro no it's not going to be like that but yeah that's basically it when they sent me this i was like are they allowed to send me this but it turns out that delta a is actually federally legal and the reason that it's federally legal is because it is extracted from a hemp plant and that's super duper dope and i can't wait to try this i did smoke a bowl this morning but i waited until my high wore off so i could be completely sober for this to give you guys like a nice review on how i feel and things like that as you guys know i don't usually vape i bought a couple of thc cards in my lifetime before but they were never any good but this one's like legit it came it came in a whole [ __ ] box but i don't i don't mind vaping it's a discreet way to get even though this isn't like delta 9 thc it's a discreet way to get high to get stoney and you can't smell it maybe i should do like a video on how to be like a discreet stoner if you guys want to see that video comment down below let me know what

like almost clear i'ma go ahead and puff on this for you guys hold on it's flashing but i don't know what that means see i don't even know how to work i don't even know how to work vape pins y'all am i doing this right why is it flashing does it need to be charged oh my gosh y'all i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing i'm just trying to do a nice review but my ass does not know how to work vape pins it's like flashing and i don't think it's supposed to be flashing so i'm gonna charge it um brb okay so while this is charging what's up i apologize my ass was not prepared today you guys oh know man this pen didn't come with any instructions so i just don't have to figure it out myself okay so while we wait i'm gonna play some among us i wish we could smoke a bow i don't know how long this is gonna take [ __ ] yes this battery charged in like 15 minutes you guys that's [ __ ] dope but it finished charging right when i finished the round of a mangas we get to try this [ __ ] let's try this distill it out i'm do it on green we got it on free flashy flashy flashy i'm excited i'm excited [Music] oh whoa i'm in pain holy [ __ ] my ass was not expecting that this [ __ ] rips honey hold on do over do over do over cut take two my chest is a heaven then this [ __ ] knocked me out damn i should have started slow hold him a [ __ ] needs some h2o okay now we know that this pin rips well let's let's see how the [ __ ] delta eight tastes man i'm crying [Music] oh [ __ ] this actually does not have a taste it says no flavoring i said that from the beginning oh [ __ ] it says no flavoring but it hits so smooth you guys it's like airy you can't even feel it in your mouth that's how it took too big of a rip you can't even feel it in your mouth holy [ __ ] it smells like like a burnt coil to be honest like what you usually get from vapes that's also one thing that i didn't really like [ __ ] with with vapes is that like it gave like a a a metal taste and like a burnt smell but this one doesn't taste like metal it doesn't taste like anything it just smells like like a hot coil because that's what's happening right here you know this is nice uh this is nice what i read is that it gives you a head and and a body high so we'll see i don't know man i feel in a head rush right now but it's probably because i uh almost had a near-death experience this rips y'all and this is only on green how long maybe if i put it on blue it would have less of a smell unless you like sniff on it you can't smell it it still has like a slight smell but i just feel like that's just gonna come with any vape but enough about the the vape pen let's talk about the delta a i'm liking it so far you guys um it's very light it's not harsh on the throat unless you take too big of a hit like i did it's pretty most definitely it's so [ __ ] gorgeous it doesn't really have a smell just the pen has a smell it doesn't have a taste if you want something like really light and mellow like with like the effects and the taste and the the handling of it this will be perfect for you dude delta a is also said to help a lot with anxiety and i [ __ ] struggle with anxiety i've struggled with social anxiety most of my life and i know when i go outside i get all [ __ ] anxious and now i can have like something very discreet because i can't just like smoke like a cbd joint outside because people are going to be like the [ __ ] is that but nowadays people vape thc so they're probably gonna know what the [ __ ] this is especially if it's in a pen then they're gonna know something's up but you know no cop is gonna stop me like is it a vape pen and it has no smell you guys oh and plus it's federally legal even if the cop did stop me it is federally legal nice i'm actually starting to feel it in my arms and my feet i started working out lately you guys and my legs have been killing me my legs feel better oh wow this is nice i'm actually feeling a body high i don't know if i'm going to feel a head high i only feel like i feel like a head rush is because i cough so hard and you know once you when you cough so hard yeah your brain gets to like posting and [ __ ] like that but i'm definitely feeling like a body calm right now like i'm being medicated it definitely helped with my muscle pain that i was having earlier today in the past couple of days dude and i'm only taking a few puffs [Music] [Music] a lot of people like to use thc to help with like headaches and pains like that i have never felt those effects from thc i've had headaches and tried to just use thc without any ibuprofen but it never it never worked for me i feel that like cbd works a lot better for pain and things like that instead of thc but i heard that a lot of people use thc to help with pain but this has actually helped with pain it's weird it's so weird how this plant works dude it's like absolutely amazing and the fact that it's not accepted by most people that could probably benefit off of it is so mind-blowing to me i feel like this would be really good for somebody that has like a really low tolerance or somebody starting off like a newbie i feel like this would be really good for them i'm not talking way too much when i'm in a good mood i talk way too much this is nice y'all man i like this a lot i feel like my eyes got lower i don't know does like all cannabinoids do that or does like just delta nine make your eyes lower because delta a probably also make your eyes lower hold on we have a phone we have um wi-fi we can google it are my eyes red yes delta eight makes your eyes hella droopy and glazed over so if you do smoke delta eight then you will also have like the same effects in your eyes because i legit feel my eyes lower yeah i'm feeling good this is like literally just like a mild not even a mild high it's just like a little lower than that bro bro i don't know i feel like i feel like i'm feeling a high to be honest i feel like i'm feeling behind i think i took a lot of puffs and it's still it's still to the tippy top [Music] yeah i like this a lot goodie kind thank you i never knew my limit and i didn't know there was like a limit when i first started smoking cannabis and i would like green out i greened out like about two to three times before and i didn't know anything about cbd or delta eight and delta a is really good for nausea so if you're prone to green and out if you don't know what green and now means it's like basically overdosing on thc but you get sick like you your stomach feels sick you get nauseous i feel like if you were to smoke this like in between hits or just like smoke a few puffs before you smoke thc then it will help a lot with um that nausea feeling oh no i'm not trying to sound like a scientist but these are just conclusions theories conclusions and theories no i just had a [ __ ] idea do a science project while high how fun would that be how fun would that be but anyway yeah if you had if you struggle with anxiety or if you struggle with like the effects of thc or you just simply don't like the effects of thc then i would recommend this to you to be honest i do feel a little high and if you just do not like that high feeling then you it's probably best for you to just stick to cbd you know man i feel good my body feels good my shoulders feel relaxed this is so good and i'm so grateful that i was able to try this out and able to keep this product as my own thank you so much goody kind thank you everybody and thank you just like you know just thanks but um yeah i think that's it i feel a little

"DMdIS3YSdwY": "hi my name is Peter I'm with transferring USA and today I am proud to present to you the transferring bait cartridge autofilter this machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions and more if you contact me directly by emailing me at USA at transferring comm or by giving me a call at 925 four zero five five five eight to offer the only us-based sales and service for this filling machine and I have warranty service that is back directly by the factory so I can answer all your questions about ordering

battery but yeah that's the logo right here we got some Eden Oh one thing about this - that I do like about this brand is that they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta take like [ __ ] point for size dad's and I'm like damn bro you you literally could [ __ ] kill the whole Grammy like four or five dads you know for them it's just like whatever and I'm like but anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and right now I feel like I feel creative you know I feel like I could go on my computer in shock I start getting down I start writing down ideas I start editing videos cuz again I do have a main channel go down to my description it's called I'm crunchy one we're at 120 one case ups or 120 cases around there you know um but the next step is gonna be your guys as you guys is diamonds cartridge second it's a soft diamond there's something like that but I saw up close and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks like some sauce divers it filled with diamonds little tiny diamonds and just like sauce no Mike I think this is some sauce to this is something I was just like [ __ ] here we have it everybody eatin fire I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs out it was everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this review makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe click that Bell so you guys get notified

I'm not to take the pic like this oh nice and I approve this is far tastes good too", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "DrRSLuSShD4": "hey guys this is dab connection we're gonna be going over the difference between fake brass knuckles and real brass knuckles this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "VNCbyRATK3A": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another video and if if you're new to the channel my name is shaka and if you're og day one you guys already know who i am what's good guys man thanks for [ __ ] always showing love we're almost at 2 000 subscribers guys and you already know when i hit 2000 subscribers i'm gonna do another bong giveaway plus i'm gonna just do something crazy for the video like smoke hello weed you know just do a dope ass video because last time i didn't do a dope ass video really i just did a little giveaway thanks smoke a little bit chill with you guys but today guys man everybody was tripping about this cart that i got they kept on trying to tell me that it's fake because i got it for nine bucks and so your boy had to do a review on this and you probably know from the title title and the thumbnail that it is papa herbs so i've been seeing this floating around the internet a lot um if you ever watch snelk steve will do it got a package from these guys he got wax carts flower and it just makes it seem more legit to me but i already know these legit because i've seen their instagram i seen what they're about they're a real company you feel me and they're a real reputable company so if you guys are looking for cheap cards for a good price cheap bud for a good price boom papa herbs but the reason why i got it for the price of nine dollars this was a nine dollar half gram card the reason why i got it for nine dollars guys i'm going to explain it right now is because i order all my weed and stuff from a place called flower go boom you probably see flower co right there i don't know i'll probably put it on the screen or something but um i made a video so if you guys want to know about flyer flower co and why you get it for a stock price and instead of retail price look at the video it's up in the top of the screen you know around that area you guys will see that video i already made a video about it so i don't really want to go into and talk about it i just want to show you guys how good this thing tastes for nine dollars guys like honestly after taxes and everything it'll probably be about fifteen dollars but your boy um you know it'll be about fifteen dollars but it's still a nine dollar car it's just that it's a delivery so you're paying taxes guys pretty much but um this cart has 86 percent thc in it guys it actually has a pretty high percentage of thc in it but it only has like .4 cbd as you guys already know most carts do not have a lot of cbd in it but this actually has a good amount of thc in it so we're gonna try it out real quick so honestly guys the packaging you know it honestly looks like a weed package this is what their weed comes into it comes in a package kind of like this so you know it's not like you know in a super expensive package or something something super fancy but oh my god right off the bat guys i can't lie i'm gonna get you guys a close-up right now but right off the bat guys oh [ __ ] i dropped it right off the bat guys the quality of the oil guys looks so good very clear it's definitely a distal it's not a live resin guys but it looks super good the strain that i got guys is a grand daddy perp you already know that's a well-known well-known strain throughout the cannabis like world is granddaddy purp so i got that one and they have blue dream and they also have another strain i forgot what it is but this one is an indica you know i'm a very indica kind of guy and the whole reason why i do live resins guys also guys is because digital it always gives me a super head high and i don't want to be feeling that super headlight you know what i'm saying i want to just feel more of the body high more relaxed like a head high super good but that's one of the another reason why i don't smoke distillates as much the next card that i actually want to buy is definitely going to be a live resin um comment what cards you guys uh want me to uh do next i've also seen some of the cards that you guys want me to do i see your comments guys those cards are coming i've seen uh the kingpin live resin you know more ursa extracts more of you know grove and rove live resin and you know bloom live resin i'm gonna get to those cards guys on i haven't forgot about those cars i'm just trying to you know do reviews on the stuff that i have right now so boom we got this we're gonna put it on the stag i honestly do not recommend this battery if you're just gonna use um distillate or just use carts actually in general because the stag is meant for putting a dome on it so you can smoke actual concentrate so it burns a lot hard hotter and the blinker hit is 45 seconds guys 45 seconds and it burns pretty hot so i could kill this one gram with a stag probably in one setting if i really tried if you guys want to see that video comment down below if you guys want to see me kill a half gram car like this in one setting get stupid loaded but um let's get into this guys this is going to be a short little vlog for you guys i just wanted to do um because i have the car in man everybody's tripping because it's nine dollars they think it's fake guys this is real you can look it up this isn't um a lot like lion's breath you go look online's breath page you're not gonna find anything like you know this is real because when you go to their page they got a good following um and they they're making more than just carts guys they're making weed they got weed going and they got concentrates that's how i knew for sure that they were real too guys like you know a company is real when they they have more than just carts straight up guys so let's take the first hit [Music] oh i ain't even smell it well i can't really smell anything right now but it tastes super sweet guys like um very fruity it has a very fruity taste um tastes pretty [ __ ] good actually but um yeah guys i just been chilling um i've been off work for like 30 minutes so i got to take a shower and all that stuff sorry if i look a little scruffed up and all that but i just wanted to get high before i take a shower get something to eat and relax today guys this is just going to be one of those relaxing days because it's too hot to really be going now and doing stuff and i'm just tired guys sometimes you're just tired and you just want to sit back and relax and you know what that's what i'm going to do i'm going to sit back relax get high watch some anime um someone recommended me parasite another freaking um vlogger on youtube um who does we vlog she recommended me um parasite so i'm probably gonna watch that and see how good it is but i ain't gonna lie guys for nine dollars after taxes like 15 bucks this is like the cheapest car you'll get for a half gram like this is [ __ ] a game changer honestly shout out to papa herbs i'm gonna do more reviews on you guys buy more your product you guys are actually [ __ ] fire like it has such a sweet taste like i don't like i'm really not a big dish with guys but i would say this this strain of the papa herbs is better than the strabinski that i had that part review of strabinski and this distillate tastes better than that this is probably the best distillate that i've tried like in a long time [Music] it honestly doesn't look like your normal dish lid it's a lot more gold more it looks creamy like if you look at it in person it looks almost creamy i wish i could get a better close-up but this one's like amber gold but since i got you guys out here before i end the vlog i wanted to show you guys my plants um just to give you guys an update on what's going on with them they are still alive they're still growing and they still got a ways to go before i can tell if there are if it's a male or female but this is the first plane i got it's looking very thick getting very tall you know these are my little ones that i still need to put in bigger pods then i got one in a bigger pot over there but um something's been eating my plant so it look i feel like something's been eating my plant so some of the leaves are looking a little like they got little holes in them and then i'm also having this problem where my leaves are changing color i'm not sure if it's from the water the ph balance or there's somehow there's nutrients because i haven't given my plant any type of nutrients or anything like that so i'm hoping it's just the ph i'm gonna have to do a lot more research but this just i just want to do this just to see what will happen if i just give it normal water you know sunlight you feel me see if i can get butt off of it but i don't even know guys if this is a male or female yet because it's not big enough to know yet guys so when it gets to that point um i'm definitely gonna do a vlog and i'm definitely gonna show you guys how it goes i'm hoping at least one of these is a female but i hope everyone's having a good day this vlog is getting pretty long and so i'm about to close it out take a shower i'm hella loaded off of this i'm not even gonna lie so peace out guys keep doing you thanks for all the love giveaway at 2 000 guys like we're only going up from here never backtracking there's always going to be a vlog if they're in a vlog in six days i want you to hit me up if there's not a vlog in five days contact me on instagram hit me in the comments i'm always looking online if if y'all think i don't see you trust me i see you guys and i hope you guys can hear me because it's kind of windy this is the last hit guys peace out you", "tHXXQbLYmP8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another freaking video you already know what it is and if you don't know my name my name is shakka zulu um thanks for freaking watching the video clicking on the video but um today is going to be another freaking review but today i'm going to review um a strain that the people from my freaking live stream wanted me to freaking try out and it is runs guys finally got me one of those rent carts because um a lot of people in my live stream said do the runs over the lemonade and then also like i bought this mainly because a lot of people um saw me do the geo pin and i showed that they had runs for geopin and they want me to do the runs for geopin but i don't want to use the geopin so i just got the 510 thread one so i got the oh obama runs guys let's go but before i get into it you know your boy has to take a rip smoking on the roach right now [Music] and if you haven't seen the video on this i made a video on this it's a disposable um cartridge it's called a roach if you want to check that out it's up there on the screen in the corner but um let's get into it guys so i decided to do runs and runs is actually powered by cookies guys there are um a couple brands that are powered by cookies maybe more but the three main brands are runs lemonade and mints if you guys are cookies fans you kind of know those are the main strains that are the main companies that are powered by cookies but um today we just got the runs and whoo and the runts is also let me sit down for a second let me let me walk over here and sit down so the runts is a lot it's a live sauce i'm pretty sure that's what you call it or it's just a sauce car period as you can see it's kind of golden it's not as dark as a live resin but it's pretty dark and that's because of the added terps if you guys don't know the difference between a disc jillet and a sauce cart it's not much of a difference but distillate when you make distillate usually all the original terpenes are taken out when you make that distillate so what they do to make a sauce cart is they add terpenes back into it to make it a sauce so it's distillate basically with terpenes in it let me get you guys a close-up real quick so you can see the golden goodness today i got the runts and i also have another lemonade but that'll be in another vlog i'll let you guys know when that drops soon before i go into that hit actually let me freaking tell you guys the content in it so it says thca 10 53 milligrams it says delta 9 thc 55 278 milligrams and then it says cbd two milligrams so we got delta tac and then taca they don't even have just you know usually they just have thc on it but they're actually telling you the type of thc that is in this pack so i'm gonna just take this first rib you know just to get the taste and everything and then i'll take a blinker head for you guys because you know i gotta take a blinker head every time i get a new car i gotta take a blinker head at least one on the new cart so let's go okay so off top this is definitely very terpe very sweet and if i didn't say so before it's obama runs it's actually not that bad guys [Music] [Music] so yeah guys man this [ __ ] is like definitely very terpy you can definitely taste the terps but it's also earthy at the same time so maybe

and we'll see you guys on the next video all right man peace", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "UndHiqmoCwo": "sour banana sherbert fresco cartridge looks very nice shot [Music] [Music] yeah that made you call from the sort of smell like Hanna maybe you really came [Music] oh he's done and he cared Lawrence well they got the bills around

card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a review there IRS's it's an ice cream cake and yeah this should be pretty bomb you know the it's full gram I don't know where these guys in their Humboldt County so yeah guys we're gonna get in straight to so you have this little button here press this button hey let me show you guys a little close-up ice cream cake and it's a 76 percent THC what I think yeah 76 percent so yeah guys this is pretty dope you know the everyone that the shot was telling these are pretty far and we're gonna go ahead and see I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys know I love rock garden and [ __ ] but I'm gonna see if these are better than raw garden so you know I've never had a liquid diamond sauce car which it says there is pretty dope you know so if you guys ever see these be on the lookout so as a little button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't for you guys I would never got my channel monetize you know it's [ __ ] crazy so if you guys ever see ads on the videos don't [ __ ] skip them guys watch those ads watch them all please it really helped me a lot in the channel but thank you guys you know you guys are awesome so we're just gonna go numb we're going to hit this and I'm let you guys know if it's really worth it or not you know what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys get well but hope you guys are ready for that Super Bowl if you got a Niner fans like this V no comment you know I'm a big man of fun as well hopefully we win it probably just a barbeque that day tomorrow you know drink some beers and [ __ ] watch the game that's on this Saturday morning he

guys stay tuned I'm gonna be coming up with a new beat as I said and yeah", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges

it's going to be from rogue river labs instead though this is the super sour diesel delta 8 thc car this is just the packaging just to show you guys and here is the cart itself um just you know you guys get that color on there so yeah um real quick before i take it uh this is of course a different brand and um from this brand you can give two options of cartridges cards with bdt and cards with cdt so that being said let's go ahead and take our first ear here and then let's talk about what's going on here with uh you know taste flavor and effects things like that so cheers everybody i hope you guys are all having a great wonderful day week whatever it is when you're watching this and uh yeah thank you for joining me [Music] so right off the bat very very flowery taste and that is mostly because of the bdds in there so here bdt stands for botanical derived terpenes meaning the terpenes are coming from flowers so of course it's going to have a little bit more of a flowery taste there um comparatively to a cdt you know cannabis derived terpenes but it still has good flavor um and well good effect you know like i said before and so my other delta hc videos i feel like this kind of hits me a little bit faster excuse me than regular thc it's a very kind of heavy like back in the head type type of feel at first it kind of just like it just kind of feels like it's pulling you back a little bit um and yeah i mean very relaxing effects not only for a lot of delta thc products and uh you know all that stuff so real quick question guys have you tried any delta 8 thc and if you have please let me know down below in the comments and while you're at it don't forget to like comment and leave another comment and subscribe if you're enjoying the video so far so yeah those are the notes we're getting with flavors here it's just kind of flowery you know i'm not getting um too many differences there you know there's a slight tang and souriness there um but not too much as we're getting a lot of that the flowery tones so let me go ahead and take another hit here and then talk a little bit more about how i'm feeling about this one cheers everybody [Music] okay before i talk about this a little bit more i do want to take the time to correct myself in my last video i said that this was legal in all 50 states it is not i will be putting a list of all the states that delta a thc is legal in uh down below in the description so you know you guys don't get it twisted i mean i have it in the other uh video as well but you know i just felt like i should at least address my mistakes i mean i always do anyway whenever someone corrects me but um you know i just feel like it's a little bit better to address that as well in the video so very sorry to those who might have been slightly misinformed i mean probably not a big number of you guys no one really watches these videos but but you know yeah so after that last hit i'm feeling pretty [ __ ] lit i know guys i feel like the more i hit delta hthc the more obviously you know you get tolerance you get a little used to it but the more i i just kind of learned to enjoy it more um i mean that's not to say i never enjoyed my first hit or nothing like that but yeah you know every delta a thc product i give you don't try out i'm more excited to get another one and give it a go give it a try all that stuff so for rogue or river labs i'm looking to try a cannabis derived terpene cart very soon so um for me this is the super sour diesel pretty good stuff i don't know personally whether uh i can discern between a sativa delta eight thc high and uh an indica one so hopefully you know i go grab an indica one as you know the cannabis derived terpene cart so that should be it for this video i do want to thank you guys for watching and tuning in and here's a little sneak peek at our next delta 8 thc video i did get a package in the mail so give me one second let me grab that thing here we are so might as well have a quick little unboxing we're unboxing this opening of a package here we got a bunch of goodies i mean you know i already know what's in this package but you know i might as well show you guys oh come on [Applause] all right well that's it's just ripping right off come on there we go oh we got a whole bunch of cartridges guys so let's see here which is the one that is oh yep here we go so we'll be giving this black lime cartridge a go one of these times you know you guys will definitely see reviews for all of these pretty much white widow koji kush wedding cake and sour banana sherbet so this is gonna be the one that is coming right after this delta a t oh i wouldn't say right after but in terms of you know delta eight thc products the sour banana server is gonna be the next one coming up so thank you guys for joining me on this video once again and please don't forget to like comment subscribe if you have enjoyed it and let's take one more hit for the road guys cheers thanks

cartridges they're 29.99 regular price uh but with my whatever code they're 22.50 i don't know why you go anywhere else at this point in the game right now um christine caleo and i talked about her the other day and yesterday so she actually uh reps for triangle um and she's down in crystal river florida she was sending me some stuff up and it was supposed to been here i guess uh saturday today sunday and hadn't got here yet so i'm gonna go ahead and do this video tomorrow's video by the way will be a little bit late um because i'm expecting that package i'll try to wait for that package to come in before i give you guys a video on that um so you guys can get an idea what's going on there um having said that uh hemp lively um so you guys check it out right i'm gonna go over to him lively i'm gonna be doing some videos for them uh mostly information videos and stuff like that a couple reviews um but these are the best companies i've found on the market so far man you can't find a better gummy um i found out that a lot of those gummy places out there uh they they don't infuse their gummies a lot of them are spraying their gummies man so you guys need to make sure that these are whole plant hemp gummies um so they're not stripping the plant they're not deriving it of all the other stuff that you know the good stuff that's in there you're getting a whole plant hemp gummy here with 25 milligrams of uh infused delta 18c these are the real deal man you're not going to find one any better if you use code whatever 20 when you go to him lively you're going to get them 20 off they'll go bulk drop ship private label you do whatever you want to do with these gummies right here man that that's all they do in delta a right now and hopefully we'll be able to help them in the future with uh maybe vape carts and stuff down the road but right now they concentrate on delta atc gummies whole plant hemp delta atc gummies you're not going to find a better gummy on the market even my girl you know she doesn't even do this and she she enjoys these companies man these are by far uh so far the best companies on the market and again we're still looking um but that's not you know that's not to say that's the end game but you're not going to find a better gummy right now that i found whatever 20 uh they are excuse me uh hemp lively uh whatever 20 you get those 20 off i think they're 14.99 you're not gonna find a better gummy simple as that okay moving on from that um going on to this uh chill review and talking about uh this guava flavored uh chill plus delta a car now chill when you go to diamond cbd man they got a lot of stuff on their website and i haven't tested all of it and obviously i kind of tend to cherry pick towards the most potent on the market you know and delta farms right now is the most probably found um in vape cards and uh hemp lively obviously has the most potent delta atc gummies but i got to give you i got to give a heads up to chill plus man these carts um i think are regular like 86 dollars i think they're on sale for like 34.80 they're a little bit more expensive than the maple supplies cartridges but i'm gonna tell you something man you're not gonna find a better flavor for these cars i don't know what the deal is i don't know how they did it but these carts have a uh probably a potency compared to vapor supply delta farms i'm about 8.5 or nine depending on the cartridge i would give this guava a solid nine of the potency um but here's the deal about these chill plus cartridges i would imagine these appeal to um females and and people that don't like hard hits and stuff that's heavy on the lungs these are light hits man they don't cost any any cough they don't they don't give you any cough whatsoever but the flavor man i don't understand you know other than blue dream uh and that's possibly because i had such high expectations for blue dream these chill plus cartridges are almost like you're i think t-birds said that these were um atomizers i think we would call them um and i think what happens is like you put the weed in the bottom of them and it heats it from the inside out you're not just putting the flame directly to it and those those things seem to give you like the whole the whole flavor of the plant and that's what you get with these chill plus man i don't know what the deal is with that um i if they were a little bit more potent with the vapor supply i mean i would i would probably be buying these all the times they're well worth 34.80 no cough very light high something you can work with all day long um in the flavor man again you most of these vape cards what happens is you'll hit them and you'll you know and after like second third yeah you just don't taste it no more you're not going to get that with a chill plus man when you pick this card up you're getting at the same time every time so it's like the first time every time with these cards this guava is a very intriguing uh taste um i like this i'm actually probably going to bake this the rest of the day um because i like this flavor it's a really good flavor and um you guys go down there man i'm gonna check it out we'll put diamond cbd on the bottom you get these cards for 34.80 they have other things on their website also um some things i've checked out oh i know what check this out you're not going to find a better deal on the market right now these [ __ ] pins okay cost about 20 bucks at the um at your local vape shop right you can get this [ __ ] cart right here for 36 pin charger and

quick review for this vape cart right here called the willys reserve oro blanco distillate card as you can see here it's made by buckeye relief and it does have cannabis derived terpenes and cannabinoids and as you can see the uh thc percentage is actually a little bit above the uh 70 legal maximum here in ohio and the terpene content is quite high uh two i think 20.9 milligrams per gram is the same as two percent and i actually got a couple other carts out to show this was the highest mercedes content that i've seen on any cart so far and it was a buckeye relief aeropro live flower series so that should be really comparable to this because they both have distillate and cannabis derived terpenes and here's a little container you can see this one has 20.9 and mercene is the highest and on this one it actually has 40.75 so aeropros are just extremely high in terpenes and that's why they're probably my favorite but i really do like this reserve cart and i actually have a little bit of the willy's reserve flower here that i got a while ago it's not the same strain but this one's called cocoa and i really like it i have a couple little buds i've been saving and then also i just ordered a couple things uh from a uh a guy that i know from reddit and uh discord he actually makes these extensions and also this like this base thing right here it's pretty neat i haven't really tried it out yet um and see how i have it set up now is with my divine tribe atomizer here but i'm gonna take that off and just use use it with the cart just to show it but um here's my regular little card atomizer or battery oh and he also sent me this too which is a nifty little luster pod holder so that's pretty cool has a nice little ohio with the cannabis leaf on it on the bottom so it's really nice yeah so here's my regular seed battery pop this thing out of here i've been using it um i definitely i like it so far wr for lily's reserve has a little thing in the top there a little plug yeah i'll just go ahead and take a hit off this first it has really good flavor um just like i would expect from buckeye relief i've really enjoyed all of their products that i've tried so far [Music] they seem to have really good effects they uh you know they they seem to work um they have really good customer service i've emailed and contacted them a few times um oh another cool thing about this mod that i bought is it actually already has the uh different firmware on it so that's pretty cool so hopefully i'll be showing you guys more of this setup soon but anyway i have my dab cap here i don't know if you're familiar with those but it just lets you use a cart with uh like a water piece so i like this a lot let's take this off for a second let's see here just unscrewing the divine tribe atomizer base right now and attaching the cart it's not really meant to use a cart with this extension but but i figured this would work okay so here we go oops this would be easier just make sure it's not turned up too high that's pretty good all right just set that there just hold it like this now just go ahead and hit it works pretty well i'm a big fan of this this little guy this uh dab cap here that uh accidentally turned my phone off there so hopefully i'll get these two videos connected to each other but um yeah take another hit off this i forgot to push the button yeah i i'm a big fan of this so far um the willys reserved cart oro blanco which means white gold um i think that's that's about all i have to say um shout out to fear and lawyering who is the the guy who made this stuff this uh little carousel thing uh and base here and then also the extension um yeah that's all i have to say thank you bye", "ANZNjsTif9M": "oh look later is that fun

three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

take those old cartridges and basically just refill them okay so it's pretty simple now there's a few different cartridges out there so this one here let me just move my mic out of the way but this one here what you do is you just simply unscrew the top okay if you can see that so now what you do is there's a little rubber piece here and you're gonna pull that out and you just want to make sure that you don't lose this little rubber piece say see the hole at the top okay so now what you do is you just take your refill container and there's a mail that will just go right into the female there of the cartridge once you fill it up all three quarters of the way or you know just below the top just put that little rubber piece back in let's screw that on hand tight like that and there you go and you can refill these cartridges right now there's different ones there's also um this is a thicker 350 milligram CBD oil so this one here screws off as well but it basically the top doesn't screw it off it screws off on the bottom so on this one you're gonna fill this up to the line max okay because when you put this back in what this is going to do is gonna push that oil all the way to the top so if you fill that glass all the way to the top and you put that plunger back in you're going to I'm spill the oil all over the place okay so this is what it looks like when you have it unscrewed okay this is the other part of the cartridge okay this is the mouthpiece and you're just gonna put that back in like that and screw that in so these are great when you buy a few of these what you can do is just refill them okay so you don't have to throw these out and a lot of folks don't know that so again you just unscrew this here and again you see that plunger now you could actually clean this out if you have a particular flavor in here that you know you could actually just clean that out with a a simple brush to get all that out of there or just rinse it out with some hot water but that's it you just put that together like that and not many people realize that you can filled with cartridges pump okay guys so that's it hey this is Keith with the cvd store look for some more videos guides we've got some great new products we've got the um some bee's knees 1000 I'm sorry 1200 and 3,000 added to the site those are on force we have our new 1000 milligram vape oil that is on the site that's in 12 different flavors so check us out guys CBDs store.com and look for some more videos coming your way pretty soon thanks", "13tTEoM9hms": "hey what's up everybody earth court beats

sellswords right here in Cali and they do their testing and a lab out of Los Angeles that's a pretty reliable so you know it is clean kind of astern means they're pretty transparent on everything that they use you know if you on their website they even tell you they're the terpene company not many places do that so yeah that's pretty cool can't wait for them to get their license you know and just like West Coast cure they're out there they're known but there's still not license so you know a lot of people are out faces I don't know what they're up to but this is cool right here I'm gonna go ahead and do an unboxing this is the SF v LG protest that 93% you can scan in the back for the results so as soon as they're licensed I mean they'll be in every dispensary so yeah got my little battery right here wagons pretty cool you know it comes with a sticker with a you know a seal no seal No Deal type of thing muha man's sfv og let's go ahead and open it up [Music] so yeah you don't

moving my car outside so I'm not driving anywhere crazy so all gold everything has the logo in the front the epilim mm from ooh mermaids and the very bottom that says yeah pretty legit packaging pretty good looked at aesthetic so this land slapping on the battery sea was good I'm trying to I'm trying to see if I taste anything when I try it you know I don't want it to be extra overwhelming I tried one the other day my boy let me try it I was actually surprised like it actually hit me pretty good so there's like it has this little gold thing you gotta remove from the bottom oh pretty nice

you today for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "Oulri9qCTkg": "YouTube what's up guys how you doing make sure you have subscribe button make sure you that like button if you liked the video today this is new to Keystone integrated yesterday

I hate these cartridges for Oh like looking at just like nothing in there sure ow yeah it definitely was leaking you can feel it's all sticky all over the side of it which isn't cool I'm going over these cartridges like I'd swear I want to be doubled try to pee a Dutch energise rhythm cart good takes good picture hard I just hate that house like give me a lease to the jeezum man but very well to medicate you and Keystone's father's well the cartridge on it happens I mean but I like TDI cartridges more than I like really any other cartridge for the grass roots are good but kind of pricey this is on sell thing was 45 bucks man that tastes good that tastes good rhythm PA Dutch definitely an energizer and find your rhythm yeah I was wrong", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get

"w-RrFVp7j14": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy time welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one might be a little long one because i got some things to show you some stuff to talk about uh and some dabs to smoke okay so without further ado i stopped at simply pleasure here uh in hagerstown shout outs to simply pleasure thank you guys awesome i didn't have what i wanted but i got some other cool [ __ ] which is pretty [ __ ] cool i did need a new torch so i picked up the new torches the first thing i'm going to show you i thought this was pretty [ __ ] cool it's these nuts torch and check that out these nice torch lighter professional butane torch right this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope they had a couple other um you know characters like mario and uh i i don't know any of the other ones i really didn't care to look at them because they didn't catch my eye but this one and mario caught my eye uh i think it's badass i did um already put some fuel in it so nice big torch right beautiful that's exactly what i needed so i got gotta get used to get used to that thing what else did i get here all right uh i did get a new optimizer for my puffco but uh i do not think it is the right one so i might have to uh take this thing back you heard me i might have to take this thing back if it works for my for my uh puffco thing then so be it i'll use it but if not i'm gonna have to take it back i'm saying that because the same pleasure i know how you guys don't like to take [ __ ] back ain't give me a receipt and even offer so i mean my shit's on mine everything's in the in the [ __ ] there you know what i mean but first thing i want to show you guys um of course the rig it comes with a a normal uh flower banger right the normal ass [ __ ] flower banger and the one cool thing is about this if you have a round uh cartridge not like this you might be able to do it like that but if you have a round cartridge you can actually put it in like that in your ball and uh take a pull off of your pen which i have showed that uh in previous fought videos i bought a new box of dirt wipes shout out to [ __ ] dirt wipes and go anywhere without [ __ ] some dirt wipes right all right this is the cool thing here so this thing is called a uh a reclaimed banger the lady lady at the head shop sold me on this i thought this is pretty cool aspect uh what is it yeah oh i'm sorry a recycler banger for dollars okay fifteen dollars i thought this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope so you guys probably seen it on on the on the net somewhere along the line you pull this little guy out there check this out right so you heat the bottom up it has this weird looking coil type i don't know thing in there right but anyway how she explained it you put your oil when you have to heat it up and as you're you're hitting instead of the the reclaim coming out through this bank going into your rig it goes through here uh or comes back down and then up and then back in so therefore you don't waste anything it's always a cycle of of uh catching your recline so once again instead of your recline going in through here it goes down and up and then back into the [ __ ] that coil looking thingy there okay here's the aspect of that 15 okay 15 i'm just gonna sit that right there in the thing all right now let's see the actual main piece what i got you guys ready you guys know meme i like i like my little uh my little rigs but i seen this i fell in love with the colors uh this was sixty dollars ready check this thing out man i absolutely [ __ ] fell in love with it my normal size rigs you guys know it's kind of like a beaker right a beaker style um yeah i mean it does remind me of my other one there with this type style thing there but yeah check that [ __ ] thing out right uh only thing i'm worried about is these little slits you see these little slits there if they get clogged with oil uh it's gonna be a rough day you know what i mean but you guys know me i don't i don't let my [ __ ] get too [ __ ] dirty but uh yeah so that that's pretty much what we got from the head shop so check this thing out yo this thing looks sweet check that out right right down now let me get the banger they come with a uh a carb cap you guys the carb cap here all right nice big ass [ __ ] bubble carp cap and right as long as it's supposed to go straight up and like like that all right right up in the middle boom so that's uh that's everything i got from the head shop i do not recall the [ __ ] price on uh the total of what everything cost but i do know the rig was 60 that thing was 15. um the [ __ ] puffco thing was 25. this was i don't [ __ ] know it was like 120 something 130 bucks but anyway here we go so i'm going to try this out for the first time i'm just going to heat it up i kind of like sterilize it a little bit i'm gonna put some water in this uh new rig here and uh we're gonna you know do a dab but before i i do do all that i do want to show you and talk to you guys about these g-leaf cartridges okay these t-leaf cartridges i am not rolling over bubble wrap rolling over bubble wrap i am not too happy with them liquid live carts by g leaf um they didn't even last me a whole day to be honest like they were [ __ ] the headspace is just [ __ ] killer okay i bought four of them actually i bought five of them but one was distillate but so i bought four of them of the [ __ ] live resin fse full spectrum extract cartridge right here's the la chocolate i saved this one because i wanted to uh like do like a little review on it right i don't know what this one tastes like but i will tell you the um the star dog was the only one i liked i didn't like the [ __ ] the uh what is it pineapple skunk pineapple skunk live resin cartridge i did not care for uh the taste was was that's that's actually a good one there the taste is just yeah it's terrible i don't [ __ ] there's another nation so i'm just gonna say like they're nothing compared to cresco cartridges um i'm gonna hold off from buying them from now on g-leaf like your live resin cartridge are [ __ ] whack and and to me it's a waste of money like i said uh i only smoke like when i'm on break like i don't smoke throughout the day like like a normal person would like that you know just constantly puffing these [ __ ] so like i think maybe i don't know it's i don't smoke a lot it's what i'm trying to [ __ ] say and it didn't even last me a whole day which is [ __ ] ridiculous but oh with that said i do want to open up this one on camera and give you guys my opinion on this one here okay so as you see it's not opened all right not open you're gonna crack this [ __ ] open bomb there it is now check out this headspace okay all these [ __ ] headspace or just killer i thought cresco was bad like my wife is really tired of me saying oh headspace headspace headspace but look at this look at that guys that's crazy now i could say oh it was sitting down inside yeah it was sitting down inside but still i can heat this [ __ ] thing up just a hair just to get it warm and uh you will [ __ ] see the headspace in it this is crazy like i know this [ __ ] sucks into the wick i know it settles and you know i know all that but i'm just saying like that's pretty rough guys you know what i mean you're paying top dollar for for your medicine like i expect uh i expect some some you know some full stuff you know what i mean can you really taste it but hopefully that that heated up enough i mean you guys can tell just about how much head space is gonna be right down to that [ __ ] base of that coil there i can't [ __ ] see it but while we're waiting for that to uh that bubble to go down you're gonna let it sit right there um stop hating on on geely [ __ ] live resin cartridges because they [ __ ] suck and i'm never gonna buy them again uh unless they actually change something about it but like i said the only one i did like out of those four is the [ __ ] star dog that one was not bad at all but getting into the tea leaf that i did buy i did buy a two gram jar of mai thai cured sugar okay and that is right here and i'll tell you what guys this stuff right here is [ __ ] fire look at it [ __ ] fire i would suggest if you got that on your menu from g leaf there in frederick or even in rockville go pick that [ __ ] up like asap once again i'll show you guys the numbers real quick there's that cart falling over on the side that's a wrap get that right there's the numbers stay stick okay so um i'm gonna go ahead and pause the video heat this thing up get this thing nice and sterilized and then i will return all right so i'm back we got that thing uh nice and clean and fried up toasted i've been downstairs rinsed this thing out got this thing on nice and clean nice bottle of water all right let's put some water just a little bit above that huh what do you guys think i know i think maybe i have too much maybe just a little bit too much i think just a hair too much all right i believe that's good all right that is [ __ ] beautiful that is beautiful oh yeah oh yeah all right well let's try it shall we let's see all right now i believe she did say that you heat it up it did say you heat it up first so let's uh let's give it a go and see what happens huh there's a little lock thing here this is locked in here right there

love you", "n4mnfadLwJ8": "[Music] hi this is Mike haver thanks for asking me is possession of a THC vape pen cartridge a felony there's a big difference between marijuana and marijuana resins marijuana is a plant it grows in nature and while it can be intentionally grown and genetically engineered still it's not considered man-made on the other hand resins weather ink oil dabs wax shad or whatever you want to call them they are man-made Albea from a plant and marijuana resins are almost always designed to be significantly more potent than any natural marijuana plant could ever be in florida possession of under 20 grams of marijuana in plant form is a misdemeanor yet possession of any amount of resin is generally treated as a felony the way that the laws applied is clear but the law itself at present is not without getting too technical as of today and I'm sure this is going to change FS 893 point 13 the statute designating marijuana as a controlled substance in Florida does not identify THC resins so there's no statutory distinction between marijuana and resin however our florida standard jury instructions do differentiate THC resins are specifically excluded from any in all marijuana instructions thus the different treatment by cops and prosecutors setting these technical issues aside a clever defense attorney may be able to get your THC resin charge dropped from a felony down to a more manageable misdemeanor and thereby reducing your exposure from 5 years in prison and a $5,000 fine to a mere 364 days and $1,000 fine just hire the right lawyer and you'll likely get the best result by the way never forget to question how it was in the first place that the cops came upon your cartridge there may well be a Fourth Amendment challenge in your case for an illegal search and seizure that said I thank you for your question I appreciate your having asked it and I invite you to ask me more please remember that at Haber PA it's all about reasonable doubt and if you like this video then subscribe we'll be putting out more sin [Music] [Applause]", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all

ladies and gentlemen we are gonna do number two guys truth yeah if you guys if you guys are a big fan of like strawberries or like short like case like Strawberry Shortcake's anything relative to strawberry this is your cart um I don't think I've ever really had any any cart or anything like that hmm that was like cherry pie or no like cherry cream or whatever they short um but for the first one that I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly recommend to start just off the taste potency I'm feeling it for sure I'm feeling like really loose just chill just you know a good vibe just feeling myself I send it real weird I don't know I just

literally taking your smashes everything chairs I've seen that mud we have this alaric cart I found that I didn't really see before there's holes in the bottom of the cartridge here so literally you get all out you don't lose nothing which is pretty cool so we're gonna give us a whack old iron along he'll break kilobytes my anything sodaw what up has it has a different taste of their flower they definitely stepped up their game huge on the flower we have a little bit of lemon [Music] [Music] yeah check out I love the cartridge I don't like is the air holes up here oh it just seems like you're sucking way too much area in with these air breakdown Keystone ha ha but anyways with all the cartridges I had I had the Cresco gone field I had the prime Afghan chunk or some prime Afghan chunk the Alera ecto cooler and the Calypso chem dog I brought all them down there with me all brand new reviewed them all literally had a whole day with each of them that prime cartridge will start there the prawn carton and the Calypso I started out with the rocket fuel cousin boat like the rocket fuel I didn't like it wasn't as full as I wanted it to be tour seemed like there was a lot of head space on the Cresco cartridge but I liked it the Cresco cart they always taste good to me Cresco cartridges they just have a good flavorful taste but back to the prime that prime cartridge was one of my favorites it tasted amazing tasted like you just did a DAB this'll erawan I mean pretty much what do you think it tastes like we've done yeah how's it don't really have a taste yeah it's just like it's like I can't force the off with different ones yeah this one here I do but I just I don't know I like people like P I like making the videos more than using them like I'll give whoever is with me or whatever whatever I got a med card you know I'll give them I'll give them a try the shot let me know if it turns black but I usually just smoke the cartridges from the dispenser Aries no yeah I mean it's just with all the craziness that's going on all the cartridge [ __ ] it's like it's hard to trust anybody I mean if I do make a cartridge I get all the paperwork from the company to me hey they show me the you know what's what's actually in the mixture you know main pg/vg coke or not MCO oil or MTO oil whatever whatever whatever but back so I'd rather yes I'm way around our smoke dispensary cartridges but if you can save big money smoking making your own cartridges and smoking on me I want to put some of that cigarettes so I bought a jewel down it in Florida because everything's they're cheap down there got of jewel from down Florida and as soon as it runs out I like the hash Hayes I like hash Hayes and in the gun we only really have grams I mean no we they really only sell half-grams our dispenser arey they go from anywhere from 40 is the lowest I've seen them that was from Terrapin good cartridges but I swear they go really fast like the liquid in them it's like seems like it goes really quick and that's again with the prime the prime like I said I loved it very Medicaid and heavy in the cup it got me through a couple good days but I say it seemed like it went the fastest out of all the cartridges was that Prime one but the crest no like I said it it's a crush no cartridge they're all the same they all got a little head space I like that they all taste good to me some you know are way better than others but the crest goes good they're all good they're all good cartridges but that calypso on that one there it tastes amazing and it [ __ ] lights you up lights you up it's so thick like the UH it's the oil and it's so thick that like it leaves a film inside the whole cartridge I left the Donner was burning up you know you start getting there I so I hate that's not like about this cartridge it has some air holes at the bottom so you get all we're gonna find out but you should get all of your you know stuff out of them [Music] oh oh anyways we are doing something crazy we have found a weight of it takes you ever see the guy that holds the vacuum blower thing and puts the big drum wheel up there it's like the things that blow up the car lock inflatable he died he died yes see that's that's so nice how that stays right down in there your holes are right at the bottom so you're probably gonna get every drop that Calypso cartridge it was all I mean I loved that cartridge that cartridge is my favorite powerful taste the taste of that clip suppose it was Kevin dog even their wax and waxes booze totally amazing not worry from Wow gives you the sweats face Illinois's alright if you house the Cresco cartridge is out there in Illinois because I'm getting a lot of different mixed up stories about the cartridges out there but yes we are gonna do I'd like to do it as soon as we get a thousand or two thousand on here or thousands so there 80 to $90 for a crusty old cartridge see we don't have edibles on here that's what's due fees our cartridges like I said the cheapest forty dollars Cresco cartridges are $50 to I think they have the reserve line they're $75 I think want to say that's the highest price on a cartridge but that's only a half a gram and if they do have a gram which I've seen them I think once or twice I don't know if I I don't know if I had one I don't know if I had a gram I had the new stones I don't know where I'm going with this but you know no I doubt Oh bro hell yeah I'm not watch something I was like swear I was the first one to get a sticky stick in Michigan I went to the reef dispenser Airy the owners dizzy was just there I got ready I'm at like the donors dizzy I got a ton of these bags I got this dizzy hats they blessed me so well I did probably 15 different reviews on it but yeah them sticky stix um cause I'm still he sticks there ain't nothing I love them I like them better than the cookies cartridge like the real half gram cookie cartridges I love the sticky stix

the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt

talking about two products and two promise I'm not happy with I'm not after that all this is a buyer beware video it's gonna be a short one two products Pennsylvania medical marijuana do not purchase I don't know what's going on first let's just jump right into the first of all there are so many products out there and all this stuff is behind the counter so you can't even really see it and hold it and touch it or whatever I mean everything sealed up they'll show you things but I mean what I've noticed it's it's a crapshoot seeing if you're gonna get what you want or I mean you're definitely not getting what you paid for because this stuff is ridiculously expensive alright so first thing doesn't work and don't buy is this this is a capsule 20 capsules in here five milligrams each I took the whole bottle yesterday and it feel anything and I'm not like a crazy junkie or whatever you want to call who just you know takes as much as I can so I can't I took two pills five milligrams each so 10 nothing took another one nothing took two more nothing nothing it's a waste don't buy it I don't know what's going on here is on line they say that 50 50 milligrams will send you to the moon some people say that's not true I didn't feel anything and that was under milligrams so either that's a dud or the internet and everybody's lying about the milligrams so that's Cresco a remedy awake don't buy it number two the strain created by Terrapin called a Rando Calrissian what a bunch of [ __ ] that is they said on the website it was going to be 17 percent THC maybe sixteen point five seventeen now it was 13 and a half THC it's nothing it doesn't taste there's no flavor they say it it's like a hybrid between a princess legged some other thing a Terrapin original therapy quit it cut it out nobody wants to 13% CHC nobody wants you know pills that you're gonna spend $30 on and do nothing and this right here how much I have left of this crap this is that Rando Calrissian it looks it looks decent it's dry no smell there's like there's no there's no smell and that was $42 when I've got an amazing ace folks hairpin and I love them but this one sucks don't buy it don't buy it on a positive note I will grab one thing that I got that I enjoyed and I think that you should pick up if you're into this and this is one of the only things that I've been able to really enjoy at the Pennsylvanian medical marijuana shops and that is be a vapor and I feel like I get the best hit invest hi my vapor and I've been going through a bunch of batteries don't buy the stick batteries don't buy that crap and get this thing it's $25 and alehrer at Plymouth Meeting which is like 20 minutes outside of Philly alright this guy it is a eleaf mini ice thick it's got variable temperature changer it's got a little mod so you could put on a bigger tank here five times is a really cool LED adjusted temperature it's not picking that up at all anyway so this was cool when I was hitting off the vape cartridge with the pen I was getting a big really big throat hit and I just couldn't stop coughing so then I sat the bubba kush cart down and waited until i decided on what battery i wanted to her maybe what exactly you know the problem was and how to fix it so I got a new battery set it at 3.3 volts put my bubba kush cart in there from GT I let her rip and then cough that much I don't lot of smoke but I definitely felt it and it was good and this was when I was a waiting for these pills to kick in two hours three hours nothing so don't buy remedy from Cresco do wait cause I want to buy any of the capsules from any of these places yet I mean wait wait till we get the cheap of chews and the edibles from from over out west cuz this crap I feel like people in Pennsylvania the manufacturers don't know what they're doing or just take advantage of a desperate market so anyway that's a quick quick video review about things not to buy because there's a plenty of crap out there it's like yeah unbelievable but anyway for this videos entertainment recommendation Hardy bucks netflix crazy bunch of Irish folks you know blaze up to that enjoy it's funny as hell alright take care guys", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it do you like it do you

that post it on a post about them that you know they have any boxes and whatnot so how did it get this cartridge cuz it's a Sour Diesel you know all the cartridges I've tried I've never had a Sour Diesel before so I was like I've definitely got to get it and this is a hybrid sativa hybrid so I'm really really interested in it so on the back it says ingredients premium cannabis oil with terpenes in this so hopefully it's pretty good now the price on these guys they're really really cheap they're like 25 bucks a gram so I was like I'm definitely gonna get it and it's a pretty nice box you know you got your THC percentage you got all that good stuff on there you like a good cartridge to have you know and yeah guys like I said it says life-of-the-party on it cuz how it's a hybrid sativa you

button right here like a [ __ ] like any other cartridge [ __ ] so you just pulled it and it should come right out like that so the box is pretty neat as you guys can see has a little artwork on the side it says reel reel on it and so the cartridge itself guys is [ __ ] amazing as you guys can see the top it's like a round it's like a dang babe cartridge sorta way you know like the top is round it's not like a like a seashell cartridge I should say which is pretty cool because I liked those round tips you know they it makes the cartridge more appealing so we're gonna go ahead and take the cartridge out and yeah at least these things look pretty damn me the cartridge look fancy so we're gonna take this little rubber thing off and yeah this is like a ding babe you know it has like that round tip like I said I really like those kinds of cartridges that have it they just make it more appealing like I said and and this was a Sour Diesel so it's a sativa and we're gonna take it off

citrusy taste to it but I'm gonna be honest it's not like a live resin tastes like a clean it's like a like a fake fake taste which I don't really care I mean it doesn't taste that bad it you do get like a little lemony taste to it so we're gonna gonna get my battery I have my yo cat with me today badi is one of the so it's pretty good battery I'm not gonna lie you know I'm not promoting nothing

really get a piney taste to it like if it would be like a jack rare well this thing really surprises me it tastes like sort of like a dizzy like honestly it tastes better than this dizzy for for being a sativa hybrid Sour Diesel I'll definitely I'm probably gonna go back and buy like two more of these [ __ ] that's how good it is I'm not over exaggerating on the flavor nothing but to be honest for twenty-five dollars a gram guys this is a bang for your buck right here these sub-sub line they had a dad like done' you have like ducting three flavors or four it only have like a sativa stiva hybrid indica indictor hybrid or just straight in dicta you know and those are only like four strains so it's not like they have a [ __ ] or sativas but they only have the specific sativa hybrid one and the how to get it's a Sour Diesel and you guys know I love my sativas you know and its really good the flavor too it's like it's not nothing fake it tastes pretty good like some natural terpenes in there I'm going to hit it again and see if I can get a good profile flavor profile for you guys wow this thing tastes really really limiting doesn't it taste like like some fake Terps you know like a fake cartridge with taste like but this thing is [ __ ] great this thing's bomb you can still like you can taste lemon in your mouth still once you blow the big old clouds out but for the high the THC was

yeah see you guys on the next video peace yo [Music]", "nclj5B0c7UA": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video but it's gonna be different from the other first three this is a part for don't get me wrong but this idea of this video I'm just gonna be reacting to what your opinions are on fake cartridges well not you guys specifically but the people of Reddit I'm going to go to the fake cartridge subreddit and we're just gonna read down the list from there I don't know how long it's gonna be but I'm just gonna you know read down the list and we're gonna have on my phone as well and on the screen we're gonna put it right here so you guys could you know follow along with me and yeah hopefully this makes a very very eye-opening video educational video because as much as I want to do videos on this I feel like if I dedicate a single video to a single cartridge I'm gonna be doing this for what a long-ass time you know and what better way than to just react to the fake cartridge subreddit and then see what kind of fake cartridges are in the streets from all over the country because like I said reddit is one of the best sources when it comes to fake cartridges and what you're actually you know ingesting or consuming so please just be aware of that I'll post the link in the bottom description below if you guys want to check out the subreddit but very very good information and you know with fake cartridges you know I've said it in the past three videos they can be good but they can also be bad and it's not worth the risk so if I can make these videos and spread awareness whenever I can then you know I'll do my best to do so so before we start this video let me take a hit this is a blooms farm cartridge so you can see it's pretty much about to be done a little bit of black stuff down there I was [Music] all right let's start this [ __ ] video so fake cartridge stop ready like I said it's gonna be on the side right here so you can go along with me this is actually gonna be a different video than I usually do but hopefully still enjoyable and hopefully still can keep people safe from smoking Fake cartridges yourself go right here we go it's recording all right fake cartridges will sit right here and we're gonna open it in to Reddit okay all right so we're just gonna go down the list okay first I see y'all sleeping on South cart okay I've done a video on south cart before generally most of the time I would say a hundred percent of the time actually if they're using copyrighted cartoon characters on their [ __ ] it's fake okay you cannot do that in a legal system where you can just take someone's likeness and put it on a cartridge just I seen the the Tiger king in a cartridge too so you know if you have if you have any questions on that it's no those are fake okay you know and obviously there could be some good ones because like I said they're fakes so that means if the good oil producers start selling them that means this is gonna be good or you know there's obviously there's a chance for it to be good there's a chance for it to be bad and it's really not worth the risk especially if you're in the legal state if you're in a legal state the only reason you'd probably buying legal hearts is because you're underage but like if you're getting a legal cart you might as well pay like someone that's older to get a real cart I mean it's hard to stop underage person from smoking so at least get him to be smoking some good [ __ ] you know like the real legit [ __ ] not some fake ass self corpse okay so let's go down Lions breath it says in reference my elbows he texts a lion's breath your carts have legalized results for why none our fate call the lab companies to verify ok glow or is this glow extract GE extracts not gonna lie looks like a really good cart like they even have it on the class I don't know but that looks like a legit cart the oil looks a little bit it looks dark and bubbly and runny so I don't know about that let's go down to white guys anyone heard of this company new to the page it's runny doesn't have a bad taste I'm still going to say it's fake I'm 101 percent its fake like what the hell two white guys come on like another thing is another red flag is if it has weird names you know two white guys come on like I'm not saying like legit companies can't have bad names you know but most of the time it's usually gonna be fake jetties jetties as though I've actually tried jetties before on my second channel it was alright it wasn't the best it wasn't that good but it wasn't bad I just remember the taste being like like a black licorice but that could be just because the stream that I chose was black licorice taste or something I don't know but I believe it was distillate so okay lemon oh she look like chapstick the one in the middle looks like chapstick like a chapstick container with a [ __ ] cartridge on top of it and that's dizzy I don't know if that's a live resident it's really dark Hey hell no Lily you just struck oil in the cart that's the oil red liquid and astiz e-card so with carts I don't know cuz mines legit too but you can definitely see some uh some darkness towards the outside of the hole so you know with carts sometimes like the oil darkens overuse I don't know about this one this is he kind of looks all [ __ ] up to be honest but yet sometimes the oil gets a little bit darker on the bottom most of time it's dis looks that do that that is big Chiefs may woods cookies aren't promoting them so my other video with Big Chief extracts apparently there are some legit ones and there are some fake ones you know I'm saying if you are a big Chiefs fan just know and be aware of the differences you know because the fakes do not look like the real ones but then again just be careful because sometimes fakes can look real legit as well so just be careful hey guys [Music] that's not even a carte Bleue Hogman or something another Muhammed I mean that looks pretty legit yeah I guess but then again who knows my friend asked me if you should buy that does not look like no raw barn this [ __ ] cap is about to be off [ __ ] that my homie makes these himself with supposed terms and wife so how does it look to you I suppose for you doesn't to me took off the cab it drops into a gaming hit weird almost like a big juice I mean pretty much answer this [ __ ] right there but like I said guys if you're taking off the cap and just drop some in there but that means you shits very liquidy and runny and that's not oil that you need it or want in a cart it's supposed to be like like a honey that's been in the freezer like the fridge where it's cold but barely moving you know that type of [ __ ] that's crazy Pier one [Music] so that's the thing that answers my question like you know you could be smoking on some fake [ __ ] and it could be good but even if it were bad the long-term effects or the effects might not show up instantly you know it might show up in a month in two months you know in a year you know who knows and it could be permanent so just be careful guys okay choices it comes with two what the [ __ ] is this she look back I mean that's a really cool idea you know two cartridges in one different strains but that straight back looking I should look like it was made in the 90s KRT another some of you guys mentioned KRT cartridges I actually haven't seen it till now from what I've seen it looks pretty legit but then again it looks like the same box type of date baits just a little bit smaller and I don't know I really don't know let's just see their thoughts on it have Quixote's have a shitty reputation as a black-market breadwinners if there was good to hide in the last long and it was a card that I would never buy again definitely not a legit brand I mean pretty much says it right there KRT like with fake cartridges you know they could be KRT they could be diamond boys they could be muhammad's there are gonna be good ones you know I'm saying and it's up to people in the legal states or the people that are actually buying it using them to be able to tell the difference okay you know I can make these videos and tell you it's fake but at the end of the day I really can't stop you from doing what you want you know I can only tell you and if you decide to listen you decide to listen but you know you're your own man just be smarter with your choices you know I'm saying cuz buying anything on the streets is no bueno you know people don't buy street freaking you know you're gonna buy us like a homemade camera from some guy you know no you're gonna buy a camera from Best Buy because it's a legit company you know I'm saying like you're gonna go by Canon instead of Fanning from this guy's garage you know that's just the facts you know if you buy but this is just an example obviously no invite you know you know homemade cameras or whatever but it's cut it's the same thing you know obviously a fake camera won't affect your health in any way oh just affect your bank but you know when you're buying this fake camera isn't there gonna be something along the in your head thinking like this is gonna break within a week you know it's the same concept here you know just be careful you know okay Lions breath is it okay for me to is it normal for our Lions breath to be clear I mean Kelly by the way another like I don't underst like obviously maybe he's probably underage you know but when you're underage everyone knows someone of age you know saying and if you're buying a fake cartridges you - and you're underage you might as well be underage and smoking real cartridges so get someone to buy your real cartridge if you're in Cali because Cali is like there's dispensaries everywhere you can look left you could look right there's a dispensary I think we're gonna end the video here I think it's long enough and I've proven my point with fake cartridges just be aware you know I'm saying and it's if I can make these videos and help and save someone from buying some of this [ __ ] then my job here is done hopefully you guys enjoyed the video like it if you enjoyed it or something subscribe [Music] [Music] [Music]", "iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional questions or concerns be sure to leave us a comment down below you",

itself alright guys so this looks I'm not too sure if this is a half gram or a program I'm assuming it's probably a half gram and you guys can tell by that by the oil color right it is a lot darker than their old Darrow dis list so I'm assuming this is a live resin it doesn't look too too dark as compared to Stacy's live resin but it does have that little amber yellow yellowish tint to it so I'm gonna go ahead and take out real quick though she is can see the difference I mean go ahead and take out the silverback clear this is their disel it one and so you guys can take a look just look at it all right so that one right there is a lot clearer compared to this one guys so what I'm gonna be doing getting the proprietary battery oh I'm taking a little cap off you know screwing this little bad boy on here let's go ahead and give it a try man Savi jeez first try of the dr. zodiac moon rock new light resin saw spins I don't even know if they're out yet I think they're out I think he said they were out in Nevada or Arizona one of those two so I'm gonna go ahead and give this try it let me see I'm gonna give you guys my first impressions all right so we're going in on this frosty snow cone libraries and saucepan cheers boys if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 let me know down in the comments below what you guys are smoking on man choose holy [ __ ] hold on hold on give me a second guys I'm trying so hard not to call right now dude so I'm gonna give you guys my completely honest 100% honest review on this man because that first hit was oh my gosh if I didn't take another hit just to make sure this is right right holy goodness dude this thing tastes so good it tastes it tastes like the frosty snow cone one obviously it doesn't taste exactly like the dissolute version though it tastes like yeah like if someone took libraries and it tastes exactly like what I no live resin tastes like but it has that that that Farsi snow cone strain coming out of it like very it's very very very heavy man I'm talking about you know how their distillate pens you know how this lids are usually filled with you know kind of like these different type of Terps that kind of taste fake this one right here guys does not taste make it alright this can literally this is live resin this is what live resin is man dr. zodiac coming out with these new live resins first impressions it's actually so freakin good man I want to try more my first impressions are that it's so good and I want to try more right because the taste I'm talking like if you guys liked the frosty snow cone taste you guys are gonna love the live resin taste it just emphasizes him brings out the full spectrum of that strain and it just it's just phenomenal it's just phenomenal it's a very very smooth hit and it's very like that's why on that first hit I was like just astonished because I when I when I exhaled there was so much smoke and I got every single flavor profile that I I was not expecting then I was not expecting but it's very very delicious so I'm gonna go ahead and hit my third one real quick just keep going into the review man Cheers oh yeah that's good dude it reminds me a lot also I have some dabs I just recently had up some lie resin mellon otter from field extracts this tastes very very similar to them and so imagine getting a dab inside of a pen this is as close as you're going to get I'm talking about when I've tried other live resin companies you know they they're they always make it seem oh yeah this is as close as the dab is you're gonna get blah blah blah but when I taste it it doesn't really taste that good as a dab usually taste man and this one for example this one is something different this is something I have never before tasted and it tastes exactly like a dab it tastes it has the full turps it has a full flavor profile of the strain it has the I mean so far the high it's slowly subtly coming in in and I feel like it just because I'm not holding it in or I'm not taking long enough hits but like obviously with the dab you take fat dabs man and you get super big but with this one it's just the more controlled hey you know so I'm gonna go ahead and keep hitting it so I can tell you guys what the full high really feels like I don't want to take a blinker I don't think I'll be able to take a blinker with this one man should we try it though one time for the semi gfm I need some water dude I don't even have water with me guys all right that's all the water that I'm gonna get oh I missed a trash can so that I don't even know if that's a sign all right we're going in hot on this frosty Sunoco and libraries and sauce blinker boys right Cheers that was a humongous I was a humongous head dude oh goodness that was so flavorful that was literally hold on I'm trying so hard not to cough right now but that was so frickin plate before I'm talking about that right there I'm getting big that right there at that blinker hit felt like an actual death yeah that definitely felt like a dab right there that blinker whoo-wee I'm I've been joking boy is that that did the job right there I felt that that blinker literally maximize maximize the Terps in there the flavor profile everything and it felt exactly like a DAB I felt the lung expansion I felt my throat get warm like not instantly what didn't like probably like in the five to six six second mark is when you guys start seeing my face like make a reaction but yeah that was that was enjoyable and it was not not as harsh as I was expecting it to be but holy smacks man I'm smacked out of my mind off that blanket guys this thing is for pretty freakin good I'm not even gonna cap dr. zodiac if you're watching this video right now which I know you are hopefully she gave me some more book because uh I want to try out some more flavors and I'm pretty sure the viewers would like to see some more flavors too because this frosty snow cone one man youuuu get it right on the nail bro this one is very very good shout out to moon rock for providing with this new cartridge man yes so so the overall review that I'm gonna give on this frosty snow cone right so I'm a base out on the high based on the Terps I'm a base on the flavor profile of the strain and just the overall enjoy ability of the you know the cartridge itself so the cartridge itself meant the high is it's good but you're getting the full spectrum high that you usually get from light resin guys remember that with me put me personally I do not get super stoned with light resin I get a very entourage effect high which is what it has to offer it's very very soothing as opposed to getting a distillate high which is very rushed but yeah it's very very soothing you feel all the entourage effect it feels very very nice and soothing and calming and the the flavor profile the Terps its chirpy it's certain way mortar purer than usual I resin that I'm used to and that's a fact man this one tastes phenomenal the flavor profile on it from the strain a really they did a really good job on bringing out the frosty snow cone flavor it's right on the nail like I said man it's right spot-on it tastes exactly like frosty snow cone no it doesn't taste fake though like you know I'm not saying their dislike cartridge tasted fake but it did taste kind of like obviously they added something extra in there you know and this one it obviously just tastes like it's coming from a whole plant so that's about that and the overall enjoy ability yes I can see myself puffing this front from throughout the day the next couple of days until I finish it man without a complaint but hey the overall fit is fine I love the high I love the taste is something I could definitely be smoking throughout the whole entire day like I was saying so yeah man I'm nice and baked I'm just gonna go ahead and out the video here man hopefully you guys enjoyed the review today man something eats at the table so if you did though do me a big favor like I always say go ahead and hit that like and hit that comment button and most importantly do your boy favorite and smash that subscribe button alright guys we'll catch you guys on the next

everyone welcome to my honeycomb clear car treat review have a senior review for 2020 this year so I thought it might be the first one to do it so there it is so I have two honeycomb car cards cartridges and um yeah I spoke these a couple hours ago and these really didn't I thought hey you should probably review of these so let's start off with them the packaging right here so this is what the package looks like and as you can see this is its THC level and I think each of these cartridges had the same THC level eighty-three percent THC and 32 percent CBD and I would definitely recommend you to check out their Instagram they post um everything there and yeah I have indica zoo keys just do this one I'm just different flavors um sorry I want to say it Maui Wowi sativa and like I said same THC please follow their Instagram the show they always update their news and cartridges and yeah so let me just open them out right now as you can see these are definitely real folks this is the logo is so you can see right here pretty cool I'll show you the other one too well yeah same thing clear it's all real this is a fake [ __ ] and these have given me I have no problems at all with these and these are just really good I definitely recommend you all to buy these and you know mine might as well take a hit right now so I my pen right here there we go it's a little burned right here I think I am think I smoked outside one time and I brought outside I was on my jeans and the oil just was so thick there just froze and so I had to heat it up and I guess I made this that or I just burned it too much huh but ya gonna smoke this right now and let's see how this goes yeah just a giant nose to get Cheers yeah these are really good yeah how'd you smoke this like a couple minutes ago I'm not gonna smoke this but ya get the idea these are really good and um actually before I go like I said check their Instagram because they said something about their they're a half a gram cartridge how it will not have a a honeycomb logo on the top and they say after they're done with their half a gram cartridge is and them right they'll do the deed over one gram too so yeah definitely keep in mind in that this is um well should I just drop but um it's just my review and um yeah in conclusion I think these are really good and um these are like next to my favorite like um brass knuckles and um slime breath and yeah these are really good and I think you all would really enjoy it I think you should all give it a try and yeah thanks for thanks for watching this video if this helps you all um the next time you buy a cartridge and you take you have a good day", "4k0qumqCKYQ": "hey guys it's Jason from best friend this is a demonstration video of the best one guys cartridge fill the gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "I4uHx1zD2Xo": "hey guys what's up in today's video i got a review on a push disposable so let's just get right into this let's check out the packaging this is a live resin uh this is premium live resin this is the alien og it's an indica uh it says organic it's got a picture of the actual live resin bar it's one gram it's rechargeable you got the california medical stamp on it uh the side says push and then push stands for puff until something happens that's the branding like i said i i've not seen any of these i've not seen any video reviews on these i've seen reddit posts on them but i've not actually seen any actual videos on these i've seen the push carts i haven't seen the i haven't looked up the pods so i don't know if there may be some pod videos of the push pods but um yeah i haven't seen any videos so i figured i'd put out a video let you guys know so if you see these you know what to expect uh here's the back it's got the lab test and stuff like pretty much every other cart that's on the black market you got all those this qr takes you to their instagram which i'll give you their instagram in a second don't worry about that and this is to authenticate if it's an actual push um product so disclaimer before anybody comments something bro you're you're smoking dog water bro it's hot dog water broom save yourself time don't come in it you don't know you're talking about okay no disrespect you're not smoking what i am so you don't know what i'm smoking you don't know my plug you don't know my source so i'm gonna leave it at that i'm a little high i already tried to record this uh like twice and every time i just i don't like the way i do it so here we are i'm gonna do it real good this time hopefully but without further ado let's open this alien og it is gonna have uh a sill that goes over this i obviously already opened it so when i slid it in i accidentally slid it in so mine's not going to be sold but here open it up you have your um disposable then it says made in the usa los angeles california um yeah there's the box um their instagram is right there official push product is their instagram go ahead and check them out if you want and yeah they say you can recharge these which i've tried it just takes a micro usb but yeah on the bottom you'll see that it says usb all you do is take your finger and it's got like a little place so you can pull out and there's the charge port which for a disposable that's pretty nice actually i i think that's a game chart changer because you know you're for sure gonna get all your oil so don't be afraid to pick one of these up and be afraid that like yo i'm gonna take a few tokes then that battery is gonna die and i'm not going to be able to smoke point well no as long as you have a micro usb it does not come with a micro usb you have to add one which usually i don't know who wouldn't have a micro usb now that is but yeah so you can charge this which is dope um let me see if i'm missing anything i don't think i'm missing anything i think i hit everything about it this is the alien og again this is what the box of it looks like and yeah here's the the actual disposable i like that it's got the window over here where you can see your oil level then on this side it's actually pretty cool too it has the push the push uh logo and you can see your oil through that window as well and then it says live resin bar then push got your uh light to let you know that it is activating when you draw on it uh on the back it's got your california stamp again and then on the side just your window and that's it and yeah all right let's get right into this boys i'm gonna take uh i am pretty high off this but we're just gonna take like medium hit there is no dry hitting this for flavor as soon as you draw it does you know hit so cheers dudes hope you guys are smoking along dab it along smoking a joint roll your joint pause the smoke with me but cheers dudes pretty decent little hit for not a blinker really smooth uh the draw is not bad on this pretty easy draw uh this doesn't hit you in the back of the throat and burn your throat when you when you're hitting it or at least me it does not uh yeah the flavor on this i'm not really good at explaining flavors so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna leave a flavor description because i'm not good at it tastes just like um pretty much just like weed in a cart you know i mean that's you know with some flavor that there's not much to it uh it is good though effects i would say pretty high give this a this is an indica i prefer indicas because i like that just calm me down kind of like let me chill so yeah i would say i'm getting that i am being able to kick back i'm feeling myself just kind of my body like my muscles are loosening up and i'm just kind of chilling you know um what else trying to think anything you guys would want to know about uh how long these last i like i said this is my first one so i'm not the best person to ask how long this will last black and sap took some pretty big draws off this i mean it's got some bubble action in there going on at the top that you can kind of see so um yeah i'll just have to update in the comments and let you know about how long this lasts i'm assuming it'll last a week maybe maybe two i'm not really sure just really depends on how much it took i do like like i said i like to roll a couple joints every now and then so uh just kind of just on my go you know take a few tokes while i'm out about but yeah i want to do a review for you guys like i said i keep seeing these pop up my plugs had them for a while and i just they keep selling down i i never get any but uh i like the whole concept that you don't need to buy battery you don't need anything you grab it you're ready to go you there's no extras you know you ain't got to worry about if your battery's charged you ain't got to worry about none of that with this because i mean pretty much you know right out the box you're ready to go i mean i don't know how good the battery life is but i'm assuming it's pretty good considering like i mean look at how big this thing is i don't know this does produce some vape so there is that i hope you guys did enjoy this let me know if uh you have tried these and if you have seen them let me know what you think and uh yeah without further ado spin your boy exotica i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment

what's getting put in those vials good evening and thank you for joining us I'm John overall dime Angelique Lizardi some may think vaping is harmless but the Centers for Disease Control might have data to prove otherwise here in Pima County the counter-narcotics Alliance says violence can also be associated with sale of certain cartridges or carts used for vaping our digging deeper team uncovered information about some recent cases here in Tucson news 4 - sauce Lupita Mario shows us how bad the problem has become this is a vaping cart it contains THC found in marijuana it's also sold at dispensaries and sold on the black market for half the price that's where the trouble begins in January three masked individuals went to a Tucson home where fake carts were being manufactured counter-narcotics Alliance officers say the suspects beat and robbed the homeowner of cash marijuana and the illegal carts he was manufacturing we've been to several home invasions this year where individuals have been shot because of cartridges sergeant Alfredo Meza is with the Tucson Police Department assigned to CNA his unit investigates violent crimes associated with narcotics a lot of the time dealers are dealing in fake vape cartridges a lot of times they're putting in unknown substances to cut it and to make a bigger volume and to make their their money stretch so we don't know what's getting put in those vials vial such as these all of them fake sergeant Meza told the digging deeper team these were seized during a home invasion the homeowner was shot and a CNA officer found evidence he was making the THC vape cartridges inside his apartment there's not a lot of consistency in the manufacturer of this stuff anywhere there's no FDA regulation that goes through to make sure that they're not putting in cases in California they found cyanide in vape cartridges Captain John Leavitt is also with the Tucson Police Department and heads CNA and it's extremely dangerous it's toxic to your system and it can not only make people sick but it kills people according to the latest numbers from the CDC 2290 cases were reported from 49 states 47 deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and the District of Columbia the median age of the people dying is 53 it's an extreme health hazard and if you look at the guidance from the CDC they they vary circumspectly suggest that you don't vape most of the carts come from the black market these are pictures of the fake ones authorities say the active ingredient in the carts is THC that gives the people the high but people are now adding other ingredients to the carts such as mineral oil and vitamin E a toxic combination the CDC has discovered that is causing nearly 3000 people across the United States to have lung issues all we know so far is that in its infancy it's caused the terrible problems for a lot of people in his destined to do even worse investigators say that the raw THC oil is brought in from California because it's legal there and then smuggled into Arizona to manufacture the fake carts police say just days ago a 17 year old was shot in Tucson and is in critical condition at a local hospital they say he was buying carts and when he realized they were fake there was a dispute and shots were fired digging deeper Lupita more real news for Tucson", "dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs

a dangerous knockoff this impacts the cannabis industry it results in less vape sales a new warning from the Nevada vaping Association is raising concerns in the pot business so the Nevada vape Association blamed cannabis products however they're finding this happening not just in cannabis products but they're finding this in nicotine products as well the problem illegal vape sellers are mixing cannabis with harmful oils like vitamin E mineral oil they're also finding coconut oil too as well and this is a result in a condition such as it's called popcorn lung or oil lung cannabis consultant Jason Kurtzman says pot isn't the problem and vape products from dispensaries are safe the entire cannabis industry does not have any type of coconut oil as an additive a lot of cannabis products and when you notice when you walk into a dispensary will say pure cannabis oil meaning that it is entirely cannabis in that vape pen instead he says it's bad players on the black-market who are ruining it for everyone it is extremely popular product in dispensaries especially here in Las Vegas where discrete consumption is the name of the game spotting the fakes can be hard when I have seen them in the past they tend to be a little bit darker so it appears thicker and it appears more higher-quality because it's an illegal product they want it to appear to look like a dispensaries product so Stewart's Minh says vaping is just another part of the growing cannabis industry that needs to be better regulated when you're buying anything illegally whether it's somebody's made a nicotine pen or whether someone who's made a cannabis pen you have no idea what they've added to this product they don't care about you they don't care about your family and the National cannabis Industry Association put out a call to Congress asking lawmakers to deal with the vaping related illnesses legalize and regulate weed vaping accounts for a quarter that's 25% of cannabis sales here in Nevada Siana Bonner Fox 5 News a local Las Vegas", "3Y-JU0l7RiQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste

know that everybody has seen like these in my videos honestly I don't think I've done a review on yet I'm not sure but anyways anyways y'all know my background anyways you guys we got a Maui wowie distill the cartridge now I've done the exotic arts and I've had a lot of debate and this and that but yeah I wanted to do one on an actual legit cart from an actual dispensary alright and again this is an oil oil product or a little by craft sorry a craft products it's a craft products a lot of people are familiar with them especially Paige like Denver and Colorado Springs because that's where it's from this is like I said is legit one and it's Maui wowie stream folks I know all y'all watching this video know that spraying is notorious trans so we're gonna session and cheers to it I think it's pretty good I'm gonna show you guys your label here BAM you can always positive on my channel there you know there's the potency chart a lot of people call it different things but yeah of course all your legal stuff I always show that like I said there's all your ingredients you always want to look that up I think there is legal legal pesticides of you that mean kind of legal and regulated to have you don't have so much and you know cuz it isn't supposed to be as bad for you and all that you know but I mean if you never know what something is just google it a lot of times we'll discover that there is legal pesticides in it but here's the Bashan numbers and no matter what as you can see this does not say pesticide free folks look at my last video and this does not say it let's see if it has any I mean I bet it has illegal honestly I better add some kind of legal pesticide in so I'm not seeing the actual ingredients on this you could always pause it go over it yourself but yeah a lot of you already know the three times here's the actual cartridge it is a 500 mg or a half a gram cart got a piece off go ahead and go to the office behind us here grab a stick trusty dusty adjustable battery cell protecting while it charges preheat mode optional whose batteries twists limbs dick screwed in like I said I got to stick with the little cuts at the bottom I'm purpose but uh Maui Wowi folks there it is cheers and I'll tell you what I think 80 2.54 per scene I think that's some of the higher percentages we've actually seen in here remember the exotic cars were only hitting 67 percent when they were actually testing here fire folks like I said guys good stuff man good stuff man yeah that's Maui wowie thank you guys I give this one a 8 it's been a better Carter just potency it keeps me in a boo-boo they don't got the flavor some of them got but that means there's probably no artificial flavor Kron don't you still it thanks for tuning in man you liked it any times

here doing another awesome review for you guys today I'm going over a product called timeless I'm going to be trying half gram strong manic art and their rest line if you're not familiar with timeless timeless products come in three different lines they have an energy a chill and a rest line so the rest line is supposed to help you possibly sleep or guide you into rest as I'm gonna be trying that out for you guys today and it says here that they're testing in the 90% range and that they're solvent free distilled THC oil with a hundred percent all natural plant and citrus terpenes so let's try it you open it the package your cartridge comes in this little childproof file it's a push down and unscrew I also have a timeless battery here to try our timeless cart with it's a 5-10 thread screw on it is buttonless so it's pulled to draw so you just need to hit it to activate it which is awesome and it's already set at the ideal temperature so that's really fun and as you can see here that it has a standard USB charger but it does not have a charging light indicator on it instead the timeless battery will light up at the bottom and then turn off when it's dead charging my have pre charge my timeless batteries so I could try my new timeless cart screw this one mmm it's really soft and smooth I have initial notes of fruit flavor little bit of straw strawberry banana it tastes like BAM give it that it's tasty it was delivered well so I really like it it's really tasty um it's also cool timeless comes with cases which you can put your pan in after dance now that I'm done using my medicine I could store it in here overall I feel sensations of relaxation and calmness um we'll see if it guides me into rest I'll leave that at a later date on the description of this video so thanks again thank you to timeless for let me try their best car and thank you to my viewers for watching my videos and you guys have a great day", "oRA0I_MagQI": "what's up YouTube this is I start images back with another review this is another church cart so church cannabis company super premium cannabis distill it adjustable airflow cartridge advanced ceramic coil 510 thread eight watts max ultimate damping experience this one is melon aid it's a sativa has seventy one point four THC and their stickers are so like blurry sorry for the steering wheel part here I didn't realize it was in the video but as I said before these don't fit on my palm battery on my claw or anything like that so I've got a normal stick battery that uses iPhone and Cecil iPhone C cell and Android I believe so church cart melon aid I'm just going to get right into this hopefully everyone had a great Monday everyone enjoyed the day four before all the rain hit it's raining again now come on so slides got locking mechanisms on it but yeah we uh pretty much finished our work day before the rain kicked in so and then came home and hung out with my son and my girl for a little bit and now now we're gonna do review I know that doesn't really because I not have a white background um as I said before on the last one I did these carts seem pretty solid reusable the top looks like it just twists off the airflow piece as I said there's like three little dots inside but uh we're just gonna get right into it see what this one's about the other church is pretty good I I don't even remember the flavor of that one I haven't touched it since I did the review so it's just sitting in a box because I've always got my palm battery like even right now let me reach in my pocket I've got my Platinum vape galactic Jack on my palm battery so break out the stick battery so that I can use this because as I said it doesn't fit on the palm it's probably not going to fit on the curve pretty sure it's not going to fit some of the hives and the Hades battery that I had this one looks like it's got a scrape on it or it's cracked one of the two possibly a small little crack you probably can't see it because my phone's not gonna focus but it doesn't seem like any liquids leaking out doesn't seem like there's a lot of residue or anything on the side of the cart so definitely get the melon tastes kind of sweet say like uh almost like the watermelon hubba bubba kind of tastes like that I'm not getting a lemonade as much I don't know if this batteries dying no [ __ ] every time I breathe out my nose I sneeze from these things tasty I'm picking these off her I think 45 apiece I'm not exactly sure what they're being sold for it a lot of the other places the guys telling me 50 60 bucks I didn't do any research on it yet but I will but until I can you know make the drive down to it to a dispensary or one of my friends houses so that they can run for me pretty much I'm just at the mercy of you know the dude I go through but he's been getting pretty damn good [ __ ] so I can't really complain yeah pretty good pretty good pretty good very tasty this one's actually a pretty good taste probably got to charge the battery so I can get big big hits but yeah if any of you like Church comment below with what flavors that you want to see me try to review pretty much any of that stuff any other car brands like I still got to get my hands on the Select do a couple reviews on that I still want to try those Rove ones but I still think they're only out in California at the moment I'm not really gonna do any reviews on dang tapes right now just I've had three good and three bed so I'm 50/50 at the moment but you know the only thing I ever really hear about this company now is it there isn't really a company it's just people buying the [ __ ] online and making their own stuff and selling it whether that's true or not I don't know that's just [ __ ] I heard I haven't really heard anything bad about any of these church carts yet other than maybe price but as I said you're paying for this big monstrous cart like I mean it's rugged it's heavy compared to it's heavier than this whole entire battery this little thing is heavier than this these are this is a little bit heavier than just the car other than that the next one will be a review on another north extracts a guy told me about them you know basically told me to go check out some other stuff cleaner products all that kind of stuff so I appreciate his comment and I mentioned it in one of my last videos I don't know if I posted it yet but this one is uh max 69 one gram but I'll get into all of that in the actual video but as I said hopefully you guys all had a great day today at a fun relaxing weekend with family girlfriend whoever hopefully you smoked down on some good [ __ ] and just enjoying life pretty much seems all work no play these days you know I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that it seems I could just work in work to pay bills and you don't really get to go out and do much just on the money cuz bills just eat eat that [ __ ] especially if you got kids but uh yeah if you guys don't line smash that subscribe button hit the like button comment below if you've had these Church or any of you have tried this one let's talk about it if there's some other flavors in this specific brains you would like me to try I'm open to try pretty much any one of them but yeah I'm probably going to end up be selling these most likely to my brother nothing nothing against them I just I enjoy what I have so when I have a family member or a friend or someone said that they want some the ones that are just sitting in a box doing nothing are the ones I'm gonna sell it's not that this is a bad flavor it's not like the other one was a bad flavor I just overall prefer a lot of the newer plant invades some of the Midnight Express flavors but that's just personal opinion at the moment there's just so much out there to try for me to me you know just general statement the ones that I like at the moment but yeah I also really like flavor XO eventually I'm gonna get my hands on some more of those and review some of those for you guys especially since they got the new packaging the new flavors that kind of stuff but as I said you guys have a great night take it easy I appreciate you guys watching

episode of stoner tips the last episode 118 we talked about sativa dab cartridges today's topic we're talking about indica dab cartridges so with all that being said if you guys do enjoy special thumbs up button and let's dive right on into it so talked about sativa dab cartridges and if you guys saw that last video I pretty much gave my honest opinion on what that what type of [ __ ] that we were kind of smoking I talked about even its if it says a label on the dab cartridge itself if it says it's an indica the strain whatever the case is I don't know I personally don't think that it has enough of a noticeable difference when I smoke indica compared to when I smoked sativa I feel like right now in this current state it's not a hundred percent accurate alright even though these are real companies going out and making this [ __ ] some indicas I've smoked I felt like we're supposed to be sativas which is really weird and you know the way that they're labeled on a box it looks very legit and I was reading some of your guys's comments as well saying that a lot of companies do not always test their oil and some of them may contain pesticides you know and and it's just not beneficial for some people to smoke and that's why I think right now dab cartridges are kind of frowned upon on the weed community I think it's not just the cartridges it's more of the companies that are making certain cartridges but I'm sure there are dab company cartridge making [ __ ] people that actually do this [ __ ] with you know all their tests and make sure that it's very quality oil that you're smoking and the labels are matching what is actually in the entire [ __ ] in the dab cartridge but from what I've seen the brands that I've smoked I mentioned a few of them in the last video they are not the way that I think a dab cartridge should hit they hit very good I'm not that's not really what I mean by it I mean the after-effects of it if I smoke a sativa dab cartridge there's no reason for me to be wanting to go to sleep in you know 30 minutes like it's not what I thought a sativa dab cartridge would be um but that's kind of what it is now same thing with the indicas I'm kind of just making this one it was a recommended one by some of you guys out there who wanted to see this and also see just have me go a little bit more in depth talking about these specific things but the indica dab cartridges what I have personally noticed is there it's it's pretty much mixed to do it it really is it doesn't matter what kind of [ __ ] it says on there I think that all the dab cartridges that I've smoked are relatively the same no matter what strain it is no matter what it says on the box how much THC percentage I'm mainly focused on indica and sativa because when I smoke I don't want to be tired after I'm done smoking I want to be able to go do [ __ ] still so that's why sativas would be more beneficial for me but I'm smoking back in the day I was smoking on sativas that would put me to sleep and I don't think that that should be a thing I don't know if it's the difference in the actual wax that's in the cartridge or entirely what the case was with that but certain in because that I would smoke it would say indica on the dab cartridge box and but when I pop it in and take a couple hits I'm like okay this has more of an effect that I can notice then the actual sativa one that I was smoking so it's very mixed I feel like all the cartridges right now are in a state of where it doesn't really matter what it says on the box it all matters on kind of how your body processes it and a lot of times this is gonna go for people who are not in a legalized state yet so we are kind of as I said in the other video we're kind of the bottom feeders we kind of get whatever company has extras or is selling them super cheap and they're easy for us non-legal states to get our hands them that's kind of where we're at right now with the dad cartridges because once it becomes legal in the entire United States I think that this is gonna be changed drastically I think they are gonna have a lot more strict things to go on with dad cartridges because they are very underrated or they're very overrated I think right now in this point like that is the biggest hack ever to get high like I cannot believe that these things are actually made like real-life [ __ ] dude you could take one [ __ ] hit out of a dad cartridge and be fried as [ __ ] man like it like you smoked an entire blunt to yourself type [ __ ] and you could blow it wherever and it doesn't smell dude it's [ __ ] crazy but in this one as I said I wanted to talk about indicas but honestly I would just kind of be repeating myself from the last video as well as I said before dab cartridges are relatively new in this generate in this day and age we're everyone who's ever smoked weed is kind of all getting introduced at once to dab cartridges here and a lot of negative reviews on certain dab cartridges as well and I think that I know why now it's kind of the [ __ ] that goes on behind the scenes that not a lot of people like to talk about but I figured I might as well spread a little bit of knowledge I don't know a hundred percent you know that I don't [ __ ] study this [ __ ] every day this is literally my personal experience with it and my personal story on how I think that these dab cartridges are you know processed and made and [ __ ] I don't think that they really care if it's a sativa and indica I'm sure it is when they make it and [ __ ] but something is just I feel like it doesn't exceed my expectations for smoking an indica as it should as I said before I could I smoked in because some of them I would be woken up to you feel me like just wide awake after I'm not smoking I'm like dude this is not what an indica should be doing right now bro and then I'll smoke sit some sativas and I'll endure fall honestly I don't know if it's the exact strain I'm smoking guys but in the end if you have the opportunity to choose one or the other um this is my personal body and [ __ ] because I don't know what I would choose like obviously I want to get us again sativas but modesta Tevas do not have that power that I want especially in a dab pen when you're smoking you know ninety percent THC in a [ __ ] bad pen and you rip it and you know you're so you should have a lot of the effects of a sativa and I feel like it like right now where we're at it's not good enough or it's not noticeable enough for me to actually continue on trying to find a good sativa cartridge mainly because as I said before we gotta wait till this [ __ ] is legalized everywhere and I think our options will be way more broad and the selection that we choose from there's gonna be a lot more a lot more looked into and studied and made sure that this [ __ ] is not is pesticide free and is processed a hundred percent through and out but I guess we're just gonna have to sit back and wait row so this is kind of a little bit of a part two to my last episode of stoner tips but I still did want to make it I was gonna make a video also comparing the two but I think that if you guys watch the sativa one and you watch the indica one I think that that is pretty much me comparing the two I don't think I need to make another episode of where I just compare both of them I think that hopefully this will go a lot better in the future with dab cartridges and you know the process of being made but we will just have to see bro it's all a waiting game now I'm still gonna you know I still smoke the cartridges it's not that gonna be the healthiest thing to do I think at this point but it's very it comes in clutch in certain situations a smoke and a dab cartridge very clutch I just wish that they were a little more processed and they knew what the [ __ ] was going on behind the scenes that's that's the thing that I don't like but it is what it is in the embryo we're gonna have to see we're just gonna have to wait it out it's gonna be a waiting game hopefully by the end of 2019 the [ __ ] will be legal at least where I'm at or hopefully in the whole [ __ ] u.s. that would be dopest [ __ ] - I just want to wake up one morning and just hear on the news leave weeds legal everywhere like that'd be [ __ ] wild that would be some watch anyways this is though guys this has been episode 119 of the stoner tips series talking about indica dab cartridges if you guys did enjoy smash the thumbs up button check out my youtube if you guys have not seen it already I got hundreds of videos out there follow me on Instagram if I guess I'm not already first link in the description y'all stay safe stay savage stay low-key it's your boy the Loki legend about hey guys adios [Music] [Music]", "C5bZbhZPRdU": "[Music] what is delta 8 thc delta 8 thc is an active compound that comes from the hemp plant it's one of over a hundred chemical constituents known as cannabinoids like cbd and the more commonly known delta 9 thc like delta 9 it binds to the receptors in our body responsible for mediating many of the psychotropic effects associated with thc but because of the subtle differences in its molecular structure delta 8 thc has different effects it tends to exhibit a lower psychotropic potency but still retains many of thc's other unique properties for this reason delta 8 has become especially popular with those just starting out or trying cbd products for the first time another key difference between the two is that delta 8 has greater legal leeway many states which allow hemp products like cbd offer similar allowances for delta 8 thc though it's best to check out the laws where you live before purchasing delta 8 products delta 8 and cbd are consumed in much the same way the two most popular products being delta 8 vape cartridges and delta 8 gummies while vaping has the advantage of quicker absorption and greater bioavailability gummies are more easily consumed and may last longer whichever is right for you make sure that any products you're considering are independently lab tested and consult with your doctor about which dosage is right for you thanks for

on a Friday which is my second day which makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a dumbass so that hurts like a [ __ ] and like I said I don't want to go to school cuz it's my second day on a Friday so [ __ ] that you know so today we're reviewing z skittles um I was gonna do like the whole gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet there's still Ziploc thinking I was just smelling bag hold on mmm I don't know what that that smells like a very like fruity maybe of fruity cushion kind of taste yeah not bad I'm a I'm a fruity kind of guy you know what I mean let's do this anyway I can't twist off the battery today we're rockin lean doctor zodiacs razzle dazzle moon rock Barry battery to take this bag don't get people don't live they can't seat you if you don't move go ahead and pop off this sexy ass rubber cap shit's girthy rubber cap on this one oh no they parked over there oh no they're gonna come join my review surprise review guests the Civic driver we're gonna pop that cap back on this old cart here just because I like to have all my cards but the cash back on kind of works out that way here you guys go here's the oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time boys go ahead and move up the throat here hydration drink of hydration drink of choice yeah hydration drink of choice is some Aquafina it's what they had at the circle-k it's on the way here [ __ ] I don't know okay anyway boys oh let me just say real quick this is for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state and adult smoking cannabis shits I can't make the rules I just got to tell you them you already know how it is if you're if you're still here let me know what you're smoking on in the chat the chat the comments the comments let me know in the comments huh otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm saying but pretty I hear guys I'm I'm pretty hungry too Oh guys bro I just parked outside Chipotle when I say something that was why I party bro bro that's some great news since I just got some great

later guys I'll see you all in the next one deuces", "qPPSe6zEzEU": "let's go everybody Cuban chronic here another cannabis video / review here we got the bubbleman trinity pin by Marcus from bubbleman Richardson a big fan of his everything from his bubble bags to his dry sifting methods are definitely beyond any you can find anywhere else so you can always take bald man's word when it comes to concentrates in my opinion he came out with this fine bait pin unit see here oh this way it says bubbleman right on it nice silver always been my favorite tone was this nice metallic silver on the bait pin batteries he's got bubbleman B and bubbleman on his cart really slick little unit not gonna go through all that right now but this is mainly just to show how to fill a vape tank in this case of the bubbleman Trinity tank so in this case both man's got this really nice glass borosilicate glass or something like that outer and it's uh it's definitely it's able to take a lot of heat compared to most baked in so I go ahead and what I do take the cap off and you got this little opening here like most vape pens even the disposables look like this from brands like select other brands like that in recreational states I like to just heat the outside and you have these little glass syringes either come with select dabble bowls you get distillate and stuff from this from the dispensaries and outlets in little syringes like this also the blue river terpenes I believe come with a little syringe like this and you just mix your tips and your concentrates in the little glass syringe sometimes you gotta heat it I use my email and just kind of wipe the vial around on it just lightly heat it to get the oil to go where I need it to go and to use these that's all in my how to mix a sauce video you might want to check out but I'm gonna make this video as quick as I can here's the bubbleman Trinity tank I'm just gonna put my Enel coil around the edge and just heat this glass to a deist in temperature to where when the oil hits it's gonna run to the bottom I'm gonna show you guys how to load this without having the needle like they show in the bubble man Trinity videos this is for people that just don't have this is called a luer lock needle that would go here on the end and that's just for the dabbling hater and actually the terpenes come with the needle I have an eel but I'm gonna show you guys today how to load it with fountain one so you had this little tip here it's all glass these little dab of wool syringe containers for oil and I just heat this up on my email as well so I'm gonna heat both of them up and heat up the outside of the Trinity tank and I'm gonna heat up kind of the outside of my little syringe here full of turps and OG shatter his og chirps and Oregon Diesel OG shatter so so you can see when you have these syringes the oil starts coming out gonna suck them back so you don't lose any oil anyway I'm gonna show you the procedure around this little edge you see that hollow you just stick the dab locator end just right there against it and I just slowly press a nice bead around the edge of it and just keep it there against the seal and the edge of the container and since it's warm it's gonna just melt right into that space and I mean this is just for people that don't have the little luer lock needle that the Terps and things like that come with so you can see that oil is just dripping around there I'm just gonna heat it a little bit yeah I'll be really careful just little dabs of oil around the edge you really don't want to get ahead of yourself there we go hopefully show you guys a little view of this you can see the oils dripping down into the tank already it's looking pretty good so we're gonna go ahead add a little bit more around the edge here it's too crazy literally just wipe it off on there you know you learn to manipulate the oil a little bit doing this you'd see it's just draining down right into the right into it so let me see if I can get this a little bit closer for you see that oil is dripping down straight into the chamber see it slows down so you just kind of wipe it on the email again you can use a lighter on the outside and and just gently melt the oil down so anyway that's that's one way and some people be against it cuz you got to heat the oil a lot you can see it's just draining right down where it needs to go a little bit of oil left on the edge here and we just wipe into the pin here okay so well that's dreaming I'll show you guys one other method and that's with a luer lock needle and that's what these little dab locators have on the ends of them show you a sec this little needle off real quick so yeah you got these little luer lock tab locator your needles and so this this little lock that goes on the end of it so they just kind of slide on and off they twist on and off depending on where you get these from but that's what this locks into so these little needles come with my terpenes I ordered and usually get a little dab locator like this it really has to be heated to go through these needles and lock securely or all the oil kind of blow in between here but they work really well for Philly debate cartridges I'll show you now I'm gonna heat the oil good though and also heat the needle just a bit so that I know I'm gonna get a good run of oil through the end of it so I just heat the needle on the outside just a bit on my email lightly I don't want it too hot these are terpenes here and you can see it'll fit right in between that little space in the vial and as you've seen in probably other videos you can just just squeezes right in just see it there squeeze it all in there I fill the whole thing up use all the church sauce in there squeezed in there real nicely filled it up nice yes very nicely filled bubbleman Trinity pin and uh some little instructions in the Trinity says right here stand tank upright for 30 minutes to let after filling before use so anyway that's a little warning for you just kind of tells you what's gonna happen and if you're getting a boil around the edge like I said just heat it up a little bit make sure all your oil drains to the bottom I like to leave it open for a while with the cap off no matter what unit you're using if your units plastic definitely do not heat it it's not gonna work for you I recommend getting a glass one that's refillable admit to be refilled like bubbleman spins here I don't know if you buy those cheap ones I don't know if they're glass or not honestly people but bubble man's is definitely completely non-toxic materials all that stuff and I will say this is from a company that's called a w-9 tech or up tech and they are a great company any troubleshooting they're definitely there to help you they know a lot about their products so their customer service is on point and their shippings fast all that stuff man there's not a problem that I can understand why bubbleman chose that company and anyway there's the pin go ahead and just put the cap back on very nice I know I might as well just show you how to use the bubbleman pin click the button five times clicks on and now the greatest thing about the bubbleman pin is you can hold that button for up to 10 12 seconds but just take a rip and you hold it for 10 seconds don't even take her up and then hold it under 10 seconds and then start ripping and you'll get a huge rip but the the main process of using these from what they've told me is puff press and then pop so you let off the button afterward and clear the thing to suck more oil into the chamber to be burned for your next hit and it's a really good unit I've had it leak a little bit they sent me another cartridge and said hey man maybe it's a seal they just sent me another cartridge no questions asked they're great company so check them out a little demo for you so I'm going to puff press pump takes a minute to prime the oil but you want to let it just stand for 30 minutes so that it all that air bubbles and stuff come out but I like to heat the oil and it'll all just kind of exhaust the cap here and there and watch the bubbles come out of there and I mentally get all the air out and you can just hold that button literally watch it it's blue it'll turn off when it needs to do you get all that oil tar in it that's how you take a hotter DAP you see the size the hits you get me Trinity always cool it off afterward just by general inhale sorry about that coffin that's just how big it hits you get off this thing so anyway Cuban chronic this is the bubble man Trinity check it out at a w-9 tech or fresh head ease calm I gave it a 10 star review myself I mean I'm sure it'll be it'll be improved in the future who knows but it is definitely one of the best bait pens I've used as far as ripping first us stoners that's what we like nice good hits whatever hits we want light hits strong hits fill your own vapes there we go Cuban chronic dads ahoy everybody peace out", "PXP64j29ueM": "what's going on baby family it's your boy fated Markie and today I'm gonna be comparing two things you guys I got a pod actually this is a cartridge I got a cartridge and I got a pod so you know right now I'm in the car I got I'm probably gonna end up driving so I'm not gonna do the review right now I'm gonna take you guys with me I'm gonna go over to my parents house today's the Super Bowl you guys is the Chiefs versus the 49ers but since it's like I'm not too big of a fan of football to be honest and I'm not too big either team I'm gonna be doing a review for you guys and I'm gonna just do a wholeheartedly like light you guys know well I personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you guys soon", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "wGsPh51K65M": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm use the code rough 2 to get a free gift and thanks again to those guys for sponsoring this video I hope you

this is Matt Roth how stereos thanks for watching [Music]", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "1EzT71Ls72g": "what's up guys today I'm doing a review on a fake Roth cart that I just got now I know that's fake because I got it from a you know one of my one of the dudes that I know no I live in my neighborhood so yeah you know it's not real unless coming from the actual dispensary but even even then like some delivery services some shady delivery services have actually you know I've bought in a fake cart off a [ __ ] delivery service before but I was like around two years ago but this [ __ ] this [ __ ] is straight from I just want from some dude so look at it it shows the manufacturing day packaging day and then the expiration date now I know these are fake because like I said these came from my friend 75 cent THC now this is how it came actually had a little sticker right here that was on here but it basically just said tore it off so I did I'm gonna open it [Applause] all right [Applause] [Music] I just comes with this road construction thing cartridge use and care instructions says your cartridges preheat time do not preheat steady hits 5 seconds or less are ideal for optimal continued performance if the cartridge air flow feels restricted unscrew from battery one quarter one quarter turn because care blah blah blah blah so the actual cartridge now so there's the actual cartridge that way I bought this for 25 a gram supposed to be a simple ooh he's young masters glue you know hook [Applause] I'm tasty look good [Applause] so I shall put them out how much another they watch a little guru the top it's pretty good it's like my shabu everybody you can taste the tea I taste good but it kinda tastes like this was on there yeah I don't taste that bad I'm gonna actually hit it now on asleep feels like I'm taking it down don't taste that bad but yeah so that was a look at a fake road part that's what a fake profile", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "Cpx1fHVOass": "this is what when you have stage 4 pancreatic cancer all my tribe mates here they are I took I had some capsules I've had some THC oil in them I took them outside on the

welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your dispensary today we are out here in sunny beautiful long beach we're gonna maintain about six feet of distance looks pretty open here got our mask just in case we got a phone call which we will decline but we'll keep rocking and rolling uh so what are we out here to do today we are out here to review a product as we like to do on wheats we are taking a look at a uh product from a company we've reviewed before but never their cartridge and that is buddies buddies distilled cannabis oil and cannabis derived terpenes cartridges this is their one gram captain kush indica cartridge which i picked up for a scant 36 dollars at a dispensary in long beach california which is pretty emblematic of buddies products in general they are usually pretty affordable for being pretty good quality so i hope that is also true for these cartridges like their capsules we've reviewed um so as i said this is their uh captain cush indica strain for 36 bucks on the back we've got a nice big table with all kinds of lab testing information uh and we can see on the front it has 82.72 total cannabinoids that's a little misleading because the thing you really kind of care about is that number next to it which is the thc percentage which is still a very respectable 78.6 percent thc all that other stuff is uh various different terpenes cannabinoids they even have a terpene profile layout there on the back for your viewing pleasure um standard 510 cartridge uh for this made by the people at sea cell technology they make a lot of the nicer i guess vape tanks which is an encouraging sign um so let's go ahead and open up this captain kush and give it a try pretty standard issue packaging which i'm a fan of don't need a lot of materials we got cardboard and a little plastic tube on the inside and then we've got the actual capsule excuse me cartridge itself nice looking oil very yellow very very yellow light oil um but out here in this hot sun nice and viscous let's take off these caps put in our plastic bottle just throw away later and let's put it on our standard 510 now and give our buddies captain kush our first hit oh okay so nice um intake design the c-cell sort of uh standard cartridge design a lot of intake holes uh nice heating element does the job uh it's got the plastic sort of acrylic tip not my favorite in the world but um nicer than some of the others that i've tried no qualms there um for 36 bucks this is a very nicely designed cartridge uh in terms of design and then more importantly in terms of what's inside that uh tank uh wow it's pretty good i um i don't think i've ever had captain kush before just sort of grabbed this one off the shelf um very neutral tasting weed not a lot of flavor in either direction kind of more of a piney taste i guess uh if i had to describe it with anything but very smooth uh very qui high quality tasting oil actually no complaints yeah very [Music] got to watch out you can't really taste it there's actually such little flavor there uh you could take much bigger hits than you're used to without without much effort because the uh sort of terpene profile for this one at least doesn't doesn't have much of a taste which is not necessarily a bad thing um i i like a little bit of flavor but i know people who hate any kind of weed taste sort of hold their nose at the whole experience um this one has very light [Applause] it's like just like warm air with a slightly piney aftertaste um not bad at all the oil itself is quite quality um so far for a 36 dollar cartridge this is a real win for buddies man um happy with the oil happy with the design happy with the uh not super ostentatious packaging pretty big win so far but it's a whole gram we got a gram to get through and that's going to take us more than just this session here it's probably going to take me about five or six days or so to get through this and once i do just like all our wheats reviews i'll come right back to you guys let you know exactly if this buddies cartridge is as good as we're all hoping make sure it doesn't burn doesn't just sort of fizzle out on us all those kind of things that can happen anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two that was awkwardly said welcome back guys welcome to wheats uh it has been about almost five days since our first check-in with buddies captain cush uh their distilled cannabis oil and cannabis-derived terpenes and uh that does bring something up my brain was a little fried before it was so hot out there i forgot to talk more about distilled cannabis oil uh in the cannabis derived terpenes what what exactly that means um what i assume buddies is means by this is they are using what is known as distilled cannabis oil just like it says uh and that is a distilled cannabis oil is um a an oil a process of extracting only one particular molecule basically of a um of the plant so in this case exclusively thc you leave all the other cannabinoids and terpenes behind and just extract that but uh they do so this is uh 78.65 thc and as i said before it is seven 82.72 percent total cannabinoids uh those extra uh four percent are the um various terpenes that they add in and they do helpfully show you sort of on the back a breakdown of all of the various terpenes not really focusing there but that's not the point um so that is what makes that up because again there are no other terpenes in this because if it is a distilled cannabis oil it's only one thing they're distilling in this case thc and all the other uh terpenes are added but they do say that they are cannabis derived so they should be natural whatever that means i just thought i'd fill you in a little bit more on that but before we um give our final thoughts here's our cartridge uh our oh my god captain kush i just about finished it i left a little bit there for us to do a couple while we're wrapping up here so with this buddies uh i've got to say this is getting a pretty nice thumbs up from me uh this is a good value cartridge all around it is not my favorite on any individual metric for sure but uh for a 36 dollar one gram cartridge uh using what seems like pretty good ingredients um pretty decent tech the whole cartridge has that very and uh once you understand why it's distilled uh you can maybe understand why it has that such neutral flavor i always mentioned even with those added terpenes in there uh still pretty neutral uh tasting um you may find that whatever way i i kind of enjoyed it uh so yeah solid cartridge design um solid oils again not the best on any single metric but for 36 bucks i'm i'm pretty pleased with uh this buddy's captain kush uh i i have no problem recommending it if uh you find it at the right price for you as well uh that's two for two for buddies here on weeds um and uh whenever we get something we like this much we want to do a little cherry on top a little something extra not weed related a little just something you can you know take with you and uh you know put in your back pocket to keep for later not that's what you should do with the chair on top you should pretty much just eat that but we're mixing metaphors here too i'm high um so what are we uh cherry on topping this week well it's not exactly buddies like uh not keeping the theming similar because this is more of a premium product and that's the good old ipad pro holy [ __ ] uh finally got a new ipad pro had a first gen um it's been a while since i've upgraded any apple product um but the new ipad pro is amazing um actually the review you're watching is almost certainly edited just on imovie exclusively through the ipad pro how cool is that it takes me like 30 seconds to do that's an exaggeration but it doesn't take long it's great i actually really enjoy doing it that way the ipad pro it's beautiful um but you know if you like apple products if you don't you're gonna hate it you know whatever um but uh if you've been needing an excuse to upgrade uh or find an excuse for a luxury purchase ipad pros 2020 is a pretty sexy product and with that guys that's going to do it for our buddies captain kush big old thumbs up and our ipad pro 2020 i'm sorry it's not a sand big old thumbs up uh and that's gonna do it for everything here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys it's been a real pleasure hanging out with you on our live streams recently i hope you tune in for those in the future we've been doing quite a few uh until then until we see on the next review or live stream or whatever stay high but more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys later goodbye", "C0I-fw0LvPM": "what's up YouTube welcome back extinct 420 here with another medical marijuana review got my new uniform today that's what took me so long to put out this next video yo your school shirt it's gonna be my new uniform for all my videos I might get another one I'll put the link in the description just the case you guys want one today we're checking out some of the cheapest the best vape pens you could get on the market right now coming from Liberty Health Sciences that's gonna be the THC count on that and then on this one this is gonna be a jack hair it's pretty good stuff I'm smoking on this you spin here I've had these a couple days so this is gonna be the gelato mmm tastes it tastes delicious these are the reason I say these are the cheapest is because these are $35 for 400 milligrams of THC and a lot of people they are misconstrued about how they sell them and whatnot dispensaries usually sell them by the milligram counts and not like half gram or grams like you see all these street cartridges have in Liberty Health Sciences is selling these which have 400 milligrams THC for 35 compared to true leave that it would be 47 for 350 or cure leaf which is they get a hundred and fifty for 18 or even move which has 250 for 35 or sir Terra which has 250 for 35 but that has a disposable pen with it this you have to have your own little vape pen I got this is for free from a friend of mine Wow it's killer right there mm-hmm you could check out the app hmm the oil in that stuff nice golden color it doesn't move you can hold it upside down for as long as you want it'll move eventually but all these cart Street carts are ugly and brown all right we're gonna try this Jack Harry this one's unopened this is what a car looks like fresh out of the pack 400 milligrams THC like I said this one it's got like a fruity taste this gelato got that delicious oh man alright we gonna try this Jack hare I didn't even tried this yet I had the flower in my last video it was pretty good I actually still have a butt of that left I'm saving it you know special occasion not so special occasion just saving it alright I'm already ripped you off that [ __ ] gelato you know I'm tell y'all what this does cuz I'm ripped definitely not like uh that one's like a citrusy taste that gelato this one has more of a berry taste man I'm ripped y'all the first batch I got which is this gelato had 75% THC the second batch 87% THC so I mean they're both really good yeah so there you have it guys these are definitely the best bang for your buck if you're going for any kind of dispensary cartridges in Florida I mean you could pay I mean yeah these people on the streets and say that oh I could get a gram for 40 or 50 but that's like of like Eric Conn says some hot dog water or something I mean hot dog water probably be better for you but I mean it's not that expensive look you off y'all get invest in your in your card which cost two hundred and seventy eight dollars and then you can get the $78 discount earth no $75 discount on $150 so I got five of these cartridges for $100 so that's that's two and a half grams for 100 bucks compared to these fake-ass half grams y'all get big-ass grams y'all getting for full 50 or 40 or whatever and this is real legit delicious dispensary lab tested quality stuff that's just you know my opinion my channel is here for people who are curious about getting their card and don't want to get ripped off or waste their money and don't know what they're getting because like you would like to see what they get before they buy it and none of these dispensaries show you any flour or any any cartridges that you can't taste it at the dispensary so that's what I'm here for guys but I'm gonna get off here I'm gonna smoke this Luke's tendo right here that's coming up next I mean I'm ripped but I like to smoke so I mean we don't get it and here check out the shirt y'all want it I'm gonna leave a link in the description thanks guys catch y'all next time", "wHhkDByqO_o": "all right so we're doing a review of the lime vape pen and the strain on this one specifically is blue dream and there you go there's the front and here the oil looks like and up close kind of a unique piece of hardware I've seen this on some vape somewhere something similar you've seen something like this right yes I saw the thinner version of this was your thinner or was it the same exact thing okay so what do you think about it I think it's pretty good it tastes if they saw it hasn't more of a bland natural taste to it it's not that strong to be honest but it's really a convenient efficient yeah all right okay and I like how you can actually repower the you could repower and if it dies on you so it's a disposable but we've all had disposables die now it's just like the Dom pen died on me with a third of the oil left in it which is pretty frustrating so I say the live is pretty energetic it's strong I would say the West Coast cure pod seems a little stronger what do you say yeah let's do it and I would say saying you know we picked this up in needles which is near Nevada and I would say that the can of a t'v was substantially stronger I would say but it's still the line is still really good I'd say it's really good I like it's like a it's a nice energy but it's not it's not that blow you blow your way strength like the can of eight applause yeah I just think more that's like convenient to having to carry around you know yeah it's just like more convenient and then I got so might as well throw in a little comparison here to kanji which is actually in Nevada product but kanji these were two for 20 that was probably a sale but at full price putting the line in the kanji would you take kanji kanji okay so that's where it's at and nothing against lime it's a good product but there's stronger stuff out there and I'd like to see it get closer look when she likes these a little higher on strength yeah I'd like to see little higher on strength and it's not just about TT percentages because this one because 87% and I would say that that can of ativ live clear that was 80 was like leaps and down stronger right and then it's congee so it's not always a high THC percentage it's about formulas whatever they're doing stuff like that but overrides still give the line two thumbs up would you yeah I say it's a good product so two thumbs up but just not at the absolute killer strength but overall good product well m'lady oil and nice hardware so the dab connection thanks for watching and actually the sig one we're it yeah it's nice harbor that's it any guys have a great week", "jK3zS3k5RWU": "hey what about you - lonely cashier bring you guys another cart review today I'm gonna be reviewing a

tips off the C cell carts right I can't see that but uh so yeah they don't twist off like a normal twist they just snap just take a pair of vise grips right close it down you want to make sure the vise grips are on the mouthpiece itself not the middle bracket right so then you want to take another pair of pliers if you're gonna reuse the automatic oil don't grab the threads could\u00edve - stripling so there's a grab brave bout here on the band's and there's a wiggle the vamp comes off that's how you do it simple as that", "-L5suEu2tx8": "welcome back to another episode of under the stairs reviews first things first I'd like to give a shout out to American marijuana making this video possible second I'd like to give a shout out to reap dispensaries open on Thanksgiving happy Green holiday so let's took it down trip down the reef dispensaries today first thing all dispensaries in kept in las vegas give you this receipt it's almost like a born-on date first uh we're gonna stop test date for the cartridge packaging date best used by i love that second you're gonna notice every cartridge should have a it's usually up here on the top i already took it off but um it should have a little security seal up there making so you can make sure no one got into it before you now grief dispensary carries one brand of cartridge they're called trike set this one right over here it's got the bowl on there i'm making a TV for the tray we're gonna open this up let's get in here you're gonna notice how nice and clear that cartridge it right up at the top it's got some brown that's probably four they tested it out but you're gonna notice how clear that is it's beautiful um nice clean product gonna get this right on our battery just like that let's see I love this too we got a plastic casing here around your cartridge I don't know how many of you ever dropped your cartridge before but I dropped it plenty of times and shouted my cartridge doing they're not gonna take it back so excuse me alright let's get into it so this particular brand is Wi-Fi I've never had this before so especially for this video I got this particular cartridge half gram Wi-Fi there it is nice and clear let's get into it I'm going to take it too big of a hit because uh as most of you know with cartridges escaping the coffee is almost impossible let me take a small hit there let's get into so this particular cards are gonna help us with um anxiety stress relief things like that I don't know if you can see right there Lima mean limonene okay that that particular ingredient is supposed to help with the stress we got CBD down here and help people with pain and things like that no artificial flavor that I can't tell you how much I hate the Bubblegum's the the strawberries the peach it I can't stand those flavors but hey some people like them this particular cartridge I made sure had no flavor Wi-Fi half Graham trike from Reef dispensaries again open on Thanksgiving they're making sure we all have a green holiday America marijuana hope we can do this again thanks", "FyItrwWgcnM": "[Music]", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs", "JgbFegknsL0": "[Music] what is a simplistic here back with another video today I'm actually outside Blake's house and you already know the deal I usually like to do the video before we go into there because the Lighting's not so good and he just plays a loud music and it's just a copyright mess okay Monni actually just parked right now he actually went to the club and he purchased a grandma's dizzy for me I'm gonna give him the money right here but yes my Moses dizzy I'm going

I'm saying the homie if you guys haven't seen money and while he's been in the previous vlogs that I uploaded but yeah he's a funny individual you know I'm saying so it's good to have him in the vlog he's got the little bone what's up we got the pretty already started in some schools you have money was crack in I'm saying your folks wrong garden wobba punch it's a little bit clogged so take a blinker it should and he's going for a double Bleecker see I told you no I'm saying we were just gonna do a little cartridge test before we go in with Blake I mentioned please always playing music and the Lighting's hello whack in there so not the best and more importantly they want to see video I just don't have any in the bank right now you know a spell is good it's like an orange yeah boom taste

give one to Blake so [ __ ] yeah I'm saying so you said the mimosa right yeah almost thank you and I'm gonna give I don't know I'm just gonna let Blake choose when I kind of don't want to let him get one of the water I know one that she's my most are peanut butter breath yeah you know butter breath really are the old dear friend no never tried these do but I know this one's fired from Stevie oh

bucks don't do money I don't know it's when I want to give that [ __ ] to be honest I'm not I'm not gonna lie I didn't tell him I don't want to just keep it it's good to be stingy because at the end of the day you might have nothing to come back with at your house planning on finishing that not in this video cuz we [ __ ] crazy like that I'm pretty little ready we gotta go in there and smoke too so you know we can't really you know I'm saying but I just wanted to do a quick video with money because honestly you've seen him in the recent videos but oh yeah yeah that cartridge I sent you it didn't taste good at all I told them I got my idol yeah that [ __ ] was hot me like 97 like 93 or something oh my god but I said no bleep no but it tasted like [ __ ] yeah that's like right there yeah

off it but not too much because I'm [ __ ] kind of blessed right hmm good that's good for the soul yeah we go away need that alright I think it's time to leave to play too late a piece [Music]", "WGYLG9X81pY": "this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 and over I do not user promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws of Prop 64 now sit back and enjoy the video what's good YouTube it's your boy savvy ji back at it with another fire video for you so first of all I'd like to thank all this recent supporters I've been getting lately man if you're new here man go ahead and smash that subscribe button right now man what are you doing that we produce some of the most fired content out right now and nothing less man nothing less so getting straight into it man getting straight into you know we don't like wasting no time out here man so for today's video man I got some of the craziest cartridges I've ever seen bro some of the craziest cartridge like the most eye appealing cartridges that you guys have ever seen I have ever seen anybody has ever seen man these cartridges are honestly like just by the eye appeal like I hope I hope I hope they're freaking good man I hope they're freaking good so for today's video guys we are going to be reviewing the hollow tips cartridges man this company is based out of California you guys can see right there man look look at this what did I tell you guys man this cartridge is crazy just look at the I appeal to it man like you doesn't don't tell me that doesn't make you want to smoke it right away man it looks like a bullet the distillate is super super clear and man look at it alright so right here we got the point 38 special which is a hybrid of full gram and right here we got the ak-47 hybrid all right so aside from the cartridges though I also have the matching batteries if you guys don't remember I did do I do do a review on one of these countries a long time ago so I have this old battery that they used to they used to sell but this is their new and improved battery I'm not sure if it's any different from this but it looks kind of the same but different packaging so let's go ahead and test these two out for you guys and I kind of want to show you guys the batteries just in case you guys do want to go in and cop one of these cartridges and you end up getting the battery so once you open it up you're gonna see open here right here I believe this is going to be the charger and the little magnetic pin connector and then nothing nothing too much in there and then right here itself is the nice-ass battery itself man it's all gold got the holotapes logo right there in the back and it got the hollow tips name right there engraved in the front man I'm telling you bro like if people see you oh and they got their their logo right there on top I don't even see them and I don't think this one has this one yeah you see this one does not have the logo right there on the top so that's that's something new that they added so and but yeah for the most part they do look like they're similar so like I said man these cartridges if someone sees you out in public your men are here with your homie smoking about yo what is that man like this thing is so I appealing man it catches your attention right away man so I'm gonna go ahead and smack both of these cartridges on there and I'll cut you guys in a little second but right here we got the point 38 special men and this right here you guys can see this little cap right here this is a collectible magnet that yes kink like you know I know there's a lot of people out there that buy cartridges of the same company and they're you know it's always cool collecting something it's always cool connecting something so like I said man the little metal connector you are gonna connect it right here at the bottom and show you guys just that twist on and I'll tell you do this thing but I just want to hit it bro I just want to hit it I just want to hit it because this thing is just like catching my eye man I can't stop looking at it so full gram politest point 38 special we're gonna do both of them in one video and then we're probably not to take some [ __ ] double hits for you guys man so Cheers if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 you are any other deal holy [ __ ] whoa dude yo that was [ __ ] tasty holy dude like you're literally as soon as the first hit man that first hit that first initial hit you get all of the terpenes event all of the terms and then you know that super super leichter penis that you get from plants that are super [ __ ] fire hey guys so after that first hit man this thing had me coughing and honestly like all right initial thoughts initial thoughts I haven't had I didn't really remember what the taste was like but this thing is so flavorful man I'm talking about as soon as you take the first hit that exhale you taste all the Terps all the freakin cannabis like literally everything there's no fruity flavors no artificial [ __ ] this tastes honestly like some pretty freakin clean distally like I'm not even gonna lie that first hit got me already to like you could feel it instantly the head change happen instantly man it might be just cuz I haven't smoked today but honestly you guys know me I'm a heavy hitter so for it to be hitting that hard it has to say something so this is the point 38 special let me go ahead and take another hit of this and tell you guys what the flavor notes are of it on the inhale you get like the really really it's not fruity but it's kind of like on the sweeter side of the terpenes it's not like very very OD ish but on the exhale on this thing has me coughing guys on the exhale it tastes a very very smooth like if you're kind of like if you're hitting um a joint and you guys know when you hit a joint but you can at the at the exhale at the end you can kind of taste like your little small notes of the weed that's kind of what this is providing with you guys so when you and the inhale you get the terpenes and on the exhale you get those those notes of the freaking strain man I've never I'm never myself had the point 38 special and I kind of want to try that in but form because if it tastes it as good as this man we're in for a treat goes so moving on to number two right here we got the ak-47 this one right here is the one that I kind of wanted to try man because like ak-47 like that doesn't that kind of scare you a little bit man like what kind of they they have some pretty unique names man shoutout to hollow tips so like I said man right here we got another magnetic tip just throw that to the side if you want to collect it and then right here same thing you're gonna have to add the adapter luckily for you guys you know hollow tips to make sure it's a pride you guys with too because I know there's a lot of battery companies out there that only ever provide you with one ring so if you ever lose like oh I see you guys these things right here I cannot tell you how many I freaking lost already I've lost literally almost every single one that I've ever had to battery so for them to be able to provide to with you is kind of that a little come up man a little come up so like I said go ahead and screw this sucker on and as you guys know you guys a little design on this man because this is honestly one of the sickest cartridges I've ever seen so as you guys can see right there I this kinda reminds me of like a little Fendi logo I don't know if you guys can see that but inside of the cartridge next to the distillate it looks kind of like a Fanny logo by notes they're hollow tips logo and as you can see right here on the bottom they have hollow tips engrave they got the California weed sticker make sure they're compliant with everything y'all ready though lab clean tested all that good stuff man so let's go ahead and some this on the battery and take some rips man cheers guys oh I didn't even think I was getting ahead I didn't see the light or not fool my gosh one second oh my gosh that was gonna make me cough horrendously if I didn't catch myself well quick written because like literally oh my gosh about oh my gosh that hit that three second hit literally was so much freaking vapor and I it would it just filled up my lie my lungs right away man you felt the lung expansion you felt the turps you felt every single aspect of this penny just filled your freaking lungs up or at least my lungs up you know I'm over here talking for both of us but yeah man I think if I'm not mistaken their cartridges have like a special special element right here in the tip that's supposed to create a larger air flow and create milkier hits pretty much so that could be why we got some pretty good hits me where we've been getting some pretty good hits office all right like I said this is the ak-47 let me see if I can get some more hint to that because our see for me it was just more like kind of like a just straight up OG if Ike if I can tell you guys the truth yes sir damn like literally every single hit that I've taken meant is straight lung expansion guys and I'm not even joking like dramatically like after those four hits that I just took I am blown right now I am pretty freakin faded i feel the major head change already and i'm just chillin at this point i'm just chillin at this point right because these are the craziest card shoes I've ever tried man hold on I'm a hit on both that you guys see if we get some point 3d and ak-47 special man so I don't know what kind of bullets does an ak-47 take just a point thirty there is pazatto point 38 special like a like a bullet or is it a gun I don't know but let's go ahead and hit both of you guys some of the craziest cartridges that I have ever smoked in a while now I can't remember the last time that I've been so attracted to a cartridge like this so right here guys I'm gonna take two different hits man choose guys I apologize for that son and stop I know I'm probably gonna have to cut that out here's me brother what the heck it was so what happened after he caught me cuz I coughed I died literally I it took me literally two or three minutes right now to recuperate myself and get get back into the video I'm not gonna lie I am baked as balls right now these pens those two hits I just took right now to where the icing on top of the cake works this thing tastes so phenomenal like I'm talking about so phenomenal I have not had some cartridges this good in a minute man and it's good to see you know a fellow California company just coming up like this and man like I said man I'm gonna be putting all their information down in the description below if you guys want to check them out man if you're over the age of 18 and 21 you guys have to be legal you already know we don't promote that stuff out here so overall thoughts on me on these pens man I love them I love I'm like I say I love them sorry sorry strong choice of words guys I like them I like them honestly I have no complaint about it I have as of now I have no complaint like the initial thoughts I have no complaints about it I appreciate the aesthetic look that they give you I appreciate like the full grams the really the taste man that taste the taste is phenomenal the taste is phenomenal I'm not even a cat like I haven't tasted something like this I think the last time I tasted something like this was like me the first time I ever tried raw garden maybe the first time I ever tried our garden this [ __ ] blew me away in our sea for someone to be doing this with dissolute it's kind of mind-boggling man it's crazy how good distal is getting I know a lot of people aren't fans of distillate now that's 2020 you know there's so many other sauce and diamonds and blah blah blah but remember distillate it's it has its own purpose it has its own category for a reason man and they lived like hollow tips you guys are dominating the [ __ ] man I appreciate you guys um producing this very very well high quality product man so we're gonna take another hit though want to take another hit for that one time for the one time for you guys I am baked as heck though and I'm gonna end it out here man like I said the flavor for this it's not to overpower with like fake terpenes or it doesn't even taste fake at all it tastes very very artificial very real very tasty man like oh jeez like at least the at least the point 38 special was a very very og and then that a k47 also was a little bit more like it's a weird combination between like an OG like a I don't know what I want to say like an OG and kind of like a just some more earthy flavor you feel me so man I'm big like I said guys overall high quality product 10 out of 10 man let's go ahead and take this rip for you guys the crazies cartridges that I've ever tried Cheers aren't

[Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] follow me on my Instagram at all money read please I'm not the hit 10,000 subscribers really really want to hit 10k you

place and then we ordered and there was that flat place called the flame burgers we did our order and all that and the power went out so like we ate in a complete darkness but ten out of ten would try

that dude you're a huge inspiration bro peace let's take a rip thanks Kenny", "P0-MXzLxg5Q": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a standing episode just trying out a couple different things and i just picked up about four new products so i've got quite a few videos to make so um first i want to start with dark star extract cartridge it's cured resin strain is blueberry wreck so i'll show you the packaging and then let's get into it [Music] hello alrighty so i should have cut the videos together so you got a good look at the packaging um let's get into it let's open it up standing right in front of the window and the lighting looks pretty decent making my eyes look beautiful all right so let's open this up this is dark star which is a line i believe by the producer northwest kind here's the cartridge itself they come in these little like cardstock containers that holds it in the container and pull that out you can pop that back on or let's take it off because i'm getting into the cartridge so here's the actual cartridge um this thing is looking very nice these cured resins always look really nice not too dark they have a couple dark ones but i don't buy them but most of the strains looking really good um this i believe let's see when this was made if i can figure that out um made 601 20. so yeah this is from the same batch they've had for a while but it's not looking too bad so um let's see yeah i think i can peel off the sticker i always do that just so you get a better look at the oil inside nice check that out has some really really nice looking cured resin bho so i'm going to pop it in my vessel that i got from the giveaway i'm going to take off the shield real quick so you can get a better look at what i'll be hitting i always have trouble when i take the shield the trouble when i take the shield off putting the cartridge in there we go so this ran me without tax because of medical 2250 um out the door program so let's try it out i have been doing a lot of distillate cards lately so kind of hyped to get into something a little more terpy it's very good i started doing this a lot more just well first because it's cheaper but also because i remember cured resonance stuff being harder to hit but this thing is so clear and clean like no resist well a little resistance like perfect amount though let me see if i can get some notes on the flavor blueberry wreck and by the way it's made by um the grow the grower was midnight fruitco um it's definitely a complex flavor that's always something right off the bat that i noticed with uh cured resin is it's a lot more complex than even live resins but especially obviously distillates i'm not getting a ton of like blueberry taste from it and try this again yeah i'm not getting a lot of blueberry i would say this is mostly just like mirror scene and cardiophiline um tasting something else i can't i think farnacin might be the other one that i'm tasting in there yeah i'm mostly getting i want to say pharmacy and mirror scene in there foreign to be like kind of fruity it's found in apples but it's also it makes up a lot of like blueberry strains and stuff so i'd say generally fruity and then a lot a lot more mirror scene i think the farnestine is kind of lower in there so um all in all though it's really really tasty of course you always hear me talking about like oh it's got a mirror scene or something like that and i talk down it sounds like i talk down on it but i really it's great stuff it's just that i kind of get bored because i'm so into hunting turks that that's the most common i think miracin's the most common terp out of any um so it kind of gets boring after a while so i look for more fruity ones or more i guess like rare terps um i learned an interesting thing that there is a terp called hashishin which is only found in hashish and it's generally used as a biomarker to detect if it's something came from hash and it's made from degradation of mirror scene through photo and or i believe photo oxidation a combination of light and oxygen but that's something that i don't know if i'd be able to find because it kind of comes from like badly treating the weed but i'd love to figure that one out i'd like to find some some hashishing extract around here or something that's where my beard looks white with this slate yeah i definitely got a lot of farnesing off that um i'm just thinking about it now actually blueberry wreck it might be like a blueberry strain which there's many i think there is one just called blueberry mixed with trainwreck because it does taste like train wrecks in my opinion um so i'd be in i'm gonna look that up after this uh video i'll find out i'll do like one more hit because there's not too much more left to say and i do want to try and get on some other videos because i got some interesting stuff i got two grams of buddies live resin got apricot glue and blueberry muffin as a matter of fact and then i got some full spectrum edible cannabis oil um the strain on that is mango kush crossed with strawberry guava but i've been getting into eating like concentrates de-carbing them and eating them in capsules and stuff like that and i used to not like edibles but that has really taken me by storm in the past week or so so i'll try out a proper edible experience hopefully i will get that whole video for you tonight and show you how i get it together and then also just what the effects i feel from it are give you a little more visual all right yeah so thanks for watching tune in to my um next videos i'm going to have out this i say this like every time but i know the video is a little less in production today but i'm going to try at least getting into the editing and figuring that out again with this video and then hopefully i'll have some more tonight so um all in all for the price these cards are solid i mean they're cheaper than most distillate cards they're like one of cheaper resin of any kind cards and really they blow me away every time so there's a reason i got into buying these for somewhat or so much first for a good month or two but probably gonna do that again especially now that i'm making videos for every strain i got i'll show you the package once more um simple packaging just paper and cardboard really but they include the grower info and stuff so that's really cool so thanks for watching like and subscribe and i hope you all have a great day", "N3tW_3x8fxE": "welcome back everybody to another podcast in the cut already knows good with the

"x_VA34skETs": "hello everyone I'm Miki from Shenzhen China we are CBD tank manufacturers he is our son of our products today I would like to introduce our su Korean TV did Hank and packages to you we

different colors silver and the code here I'd also like to tell you this is our new presentation magnetic tank tank floating pot", "NOl3lkgTT-Y": "yo what is going on everybody this is weed them boys on the we dem boys Channel I'm here bringing a tutorial on how to unclog your vape pin this goes with like any cartridges you know of any sort for smoking like a some sort of liquid of or oil you know so basically this is showing you how to get this part in clogged because what happens is I'm just one on a little trip to the desert basically and uh it's really too hot to even take these things out there the temperature is like war about you know ranging from a hundred degrees like 110 and riding in the car they see worked okay and even then you can still feel the heat in the car so what happened was the liquid started just heating up too much and it just got filled here like it would get liquefied and I guess I got blocked so if you take a flashlight to your cartridge look in here you'll see it at the block right now mine isn't because well I I kind of just found out my way how to fix it this is um and this may not work with all cartridges as a disclaimer because this is a heavy hitters I'm not sure throw the same like that inside where it's a little bucket and then a narrow hole for where the vacant escape anyway let's just get to tutorial so what you need is a cartridge you gotta need a lighter not preferably a lighter because you don't want to use a tortured you're way too hot and are a liar would be safer so not everybody has torso lighter I recommend having these these are alcohol swabs relying on so I recommend getting a couple of these you can find those at Walmart Walgreens I can't guarantee you will find them out get the which called 99-cent store but if you don't have those you could use like a q-tip or maybe a q-tip what some alcohol higher grade would be better like ninety percent or something anyway first step you want to get your vape and get your vape you're gonna hold at one side I'll show it while recording is call me crazy I'll hold it one side and you get the other you light the lighter you basically have to hold it till this gets hot now you wanna be careful how you're holding it because the liquid will start dripping out so you want to make sure your hands will not be touching the liquid because when it falls out its gonna be like hot cuz it's melting scumbag lava high if it gets on you it's gonna burn so this is just example just to show you but be careful how you are aiming the lighter you don't have to buy it like this to use your hand like that just make sure you're getting the metal part and this will take like maybe about a cool minute you'll know it's gonna be hot enough when you start seeing the the chrome tip starts to look like blackened will start to singe the actual chrome tip doesn't actually burn our mounts because it's metal if it's plastic you know melt and that's not good so don't worry about melting we'll be fine you wanna do this for a minute and then after a while should be hot enough to where the liquid should just see I think I'm pretty good already because you could see the gunk previously that was in it there's all that and it was just uh not good and there is a little bit still there I guess you can see how it blackened around there please do not don't don't touch the chrome tape because that's just gonna be hot so just be careful guys cuz may be doing this you know when you uh that's a little bit mess and your system so just be careful with that and once you're done you're gonna want to get the alcohol wipes and I don't have another one right now I could just reuse this one real quick is still kind of moist last week check this out all right so all you gotta do is I just get that thing oh [ __ ] is still hot you just you might want to wait give it like five minutes let it cool off I not still hot but just for the sake of the video lightly touching it with just the cloth it wasn't super hot but it was still hot enough for her gotta be careful and like I said this one's not as dense but once you use the alcohol swab or this in this case I'm using an alcohol pad just make sure you wipe off any excess side from the lighter and make sure you also another thing is to outside the mouthpiece kind of clean inside just in case so you're not you know getting any of the fumes that you're using the lighter from you know and after that well check the inside make sure it's clear if it is go ahead and give it a test suck you know take a test hit basically and like I said be careful cuz this this is real metal so it's gonna conduct heat it's gonna stay warm basically and I will get another one but I'm recording on my iPhone so I can't like pause and restart the video kind of sucks but I'll give it a test suck real quick just to make sure just kind of want to cool it off because it is really still kind of warm I'm not trying to burn my lips it feels ok to get like a quick heat off of me okay making sure all this is off and it may take a little longer there's not really much of a long process just making sure that you get you empty out all that burnt hardened wax that was in the mouthpiece little hole I kind of just still trying to I'll just put in my fridge real quick you know all right I'm just over here in the freezer just not put it on there but just kind of keep it in here so my hands it's gonna be too hot to still get like a test test it over I may see only just cooling it with the ice now basically by now you will you would have been done already and giving your test to it but yeah basically at this point or just moment I'm you you're your vape should be cleared and you should be able to get a test hit half of it and I show you right now I'll do a quick test in oh one other thing to other thing if you have a second alcohol swab or tab I recommend using it on the bottom of here because sometimes there can be a leakage for some reason because the air I live I've had it where this part will get sticky and you also want to clean the inside or nothing of what you have inside and also make sure make sure you clean that content because of that contact I can't hit this part of the vape it's not going to get any it's not even like conduct any electricity to you know melt the vape and for you to take you know the vape it so make sure you clean the bottom of your cartridge as well as the inside of your vaping ping once you do that make sure there's no leakage or no blockage excuse me do this again I would say started off slow you know right now my pan I could go up to a 4.3 volts which isn't much but honestly it's the perfect amount when I'm using it for right now I'll play like a 3.3 now but I'm glad I got 3.5 so I get some juice going take the hit I'll try one more time but it was a pretty good hit it's cuz there's not much in the cartridge to begin with it's kind of like most of it got stuck up here but here we go yeah it still needs it very clean it's like I said make sure you clean inside real good because I feel like some of that suck get in there too you know yeah so make sure you give it a good clean other than that guys that's pretty much how you get your your vape unclogged this is the Alpine one you want to be careful cuz like I said this is heavy hitters you can see how these Alpine ones really it conducts electricity and then they not my bad electricity conducts heat and this rubber band that kind of like a seal for this could maybe break or get worked so you wanna be careful depending on what kind of vape in your head you queue and see here how it looks like there's a coil in there and it's more like a direct passage compared to how the heavy hitters is just like it starts off flourish and then it goes in thin and so I hope this video kind of help you guys out look a little tutorial just kind of found it out yeah so next time guys deuces", "cVoQG7IDVD0": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I'm excited to be back at you with another legal cartridge review here in Illinois as you can see this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "FuV3jVBhbNQ": "alright what's up everybody so today we have a review on the off light sour banana sherbert THC pin and just give you a little rundown on the box here if you can see it boom boom this is recorded just off my phone so I'm sure I'm sure you can't see it all but you know just a little a little rundown on the box whatever packaging whatever blah blah blah there's the front there it is from the side there you know you know how it is so while I make this review I am gonna be playing runescape in the background so if I look away I apologize but here it is this is a sativa I've never had this strain a sour banished sherbert never had it but here is the cartridge itself you squeeze these [ __ ] off there boom boom alright so here it is let me see if I can get it to focus a little better maybe but anyway there it is boom baby as well but oops she's confusing I've been anyway so yeah basically that's it we could do the the test of the the oil itself you could see the bubble there kind of yeah that's about as good as you're gonna get I'll be honest with you but um well it looks well moving very very slowly I'm not even gonna bore you guys with it it's so slow but um looks nice it feels good too I have some of these other tank babes cards which I'm also also gonna be reviewing I'll just pull an hour oh quick just give you guys a little uh side-by-side comparison I know these are both more black market brand carts but this one this one just feels so much cheaper than this one but they are all I can get my area I will say though the oil on this one still moves pretty slowly as you can see so it mean it's not bad at all in that in that regard but that doesn't always mean it's quality but uh put that [ __ ] back in the box real quick and I'll get straight into the vo I know I've been rambling a little bit but it's coming up soon so I have the shitty pin was given to me don't remember what it is but I paid like ten bucks for it so it's whatever I'm definitely need to get a better one but I'll put it on here and I'll give it a few hits on sale I think also have not smoked today have not smoked in a while actually so hold on so I should feel this completely clearly and how it is meant to feel so let's see okay okay all right so soft with the taste definitely taste not artificial I know sometimes these like sour apple that's not that's never gonna taste like that I'll be honest with you and I've had real carts before from this licensed dispensaries and this tastes pretty comparable to it to how they taste I've had four or five and get one more real quick yep definitely tastes super good I'm not trying to knock it at all it tastes very good kind of I don't know it's kind of kind of fruity nothing nothing real major nothing that will really scream out at you but it definitely has a taste that's for sure let me get one more just then I'll wrap up the video tell you what tell you what I think all right so on the taste taste this is good this is definitely good tastes legit and I can always tell my taste for honestly but tastes very good starting to feel the head change looks nice I mean looks looks super legit it doesn't feel like [ __ ] it doesn't hit like [ __ ] doesn't taste like [ __ ] most importantly to me and starting at the onset effects I can't really give you an honest an honest review on how it makes you feel yet just because it's only I've only hid this for like two minutes ago but I will leave that in the comments but yeah I give this a solid of you this is nice this taste yeah like I said kind of fruity after tones but nothing really jumps out it actually just tastes like weed but I think that's a good thing most most discipline should yeah this gets a good for this gets a thumbs up for me so thanks for watching in I got two more reviews I'm gonna do soon which would be these two I have a was it a a purple punch and a birthday cake that I will review be reviewing by myself and then got this sour apple that my homie might review with me we'll see you about that but uh yeah I stay tuned and I know two uploads

you know here it is packaging is dope right off the back the Millea mission statement we started with single strand cannabis frozen fresh at the farm and carefully refine it to craft terpene rich full spectrum cannabis sauce look what the packaging is like so there's that little half gram it says cutter Mayberry that's understandable because my rink is out of service so I've been taking dad's we're

very tasty very very tasty it has a very pleasant gelato flavor doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it doesn't taste all artificial instead you know [ __ ] that [Music] so yeah this

starting his [ __ ] sweat I just wanted to give you guys a quick little review on the Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "AuodEj6oziI": "what's up guys thanks for stopping by and checking out another one reviews today i went out and picked up some more platinum vapes these are some new strands that were recently released i can tell by the lab testing date they haven't been out very long and i'm constantly on these websites and constantly looking so whenever new strands pop up i try to run and grab them for you guys and tess and i know platinum vape seems to be one of my most viewed products that i review on here so i haven't been straying away too much from them plus every time i get on every time i go to the dispenser to grab more there seems to be new strands out so i was saying this in the beginning i wish platinum vape would putting the strands out more frequently and it seems like they're doing so so that's pretty cool because like i said platinum vape has always been my go-to um company whenever i want to get you know this lit i also um like select delete a lot too but platinum vape is always my favorite really because it tastes good they i feel like they make a good product and it's not so expensive and there's usually often deals that are random platinum vape which make it more um enticing to buy as well so that being said i'm going to take a look today we have a hybrid which is cherry pie it's lab test date was a 6 or 3 16 of 21 and then guava cake and its lab test date was three eight of 21. i've already went ahead and pre-loaded the uh cherry pie just being that i don't have the table set up here and actually to be honest with you guys i've been i've been saying i'm gonna get the tail back out and go back to my old setup and do all that but i kind of like the way this is set up i kind of weigh the like the way the camera is in front of me how can um you guys can see everything it just seems like a better setup without that big table and the way i have my microphone right here i like the way that so i like the feel of it kind of feels a little more intimate a little more one-on-one with you guys why'd i do a double blink that was creepy but anyways cherry pie first this laptop it does come in at 82.81 right off the bat really good tasting cartridge really smooth kind of piney and sweet a nice herbal taste to it this is a well-balanced cartridge really tastes nice i've noticed excuse me got them little rookie lungs but uh i've noticed with a lot of these new strands that platinum vapes put out i've only not liked one and it was the sativa that was i think the apple fritter i did see the chocolate tie they had out today on um the sativa i know there's a couple of sativas there's actually a few other indicas too so maybe later on in the week i can grab some more of those i do have two other ones to test too i think it's larry og and i'm not sure uh larry og and hindu kush they're in hindu kush i picked up as well so check out that review probably tomorrow i'll do that one for you guys but right off the rip this one here like i said it's really sweet the cherry pie it's well balanced it's herbal tasting got a nice aroma that comes off at you this is a really good cartridge i'll give this one four stars it it's got a nice smoothness to it and it's not too harsh i could see myself probably picking this up more than once maybe once or twice it's a cartridge that you can enjoy smoking readily regularly regularly jesus cry me yeah this is a cartridge you could pick up multiple times and you'd be happy with it so get a chance to check out cherry pie let me know in the comments what you think if you have checked it out like i said i know i do know it's fairly new it hasn't been out terribly long so if you had a chance to check it out or if you haven't grab it come back and let me know see if you think you agree with me or if you don't i appreciate you on that so the cherry pie for me two thumbs up i'll give it a four stars and i didn't get to flick you guys off sorry yes wipe my nose off with that being said i will switch up and we'll get this guava kick loaded the indica that's the only thing without having a table you know it makes it a little bit harder to to load this stuff up and everything but i mean it's not like i'm loading a magazine to a gun or something you know i mean it's a one part you push it and screw it so i think i can figure it out and do not make it too difficult why did i just drop that box hold on guys sorry about that so this uh guava cake is 83.34 and it is an indica this one right here it's a little more it's a little harsher especially after having trying that cherry pie this guava cake is a little harsher it's a little more more peppery piney tasting it's definitely not bad it's not bad but with all the other strands that come out well as of late you don't being able to try them and stuff you're going to have ones that aren't that don't knock you off your feet you know what i mean some that are just you know borderline and that are basic and they're good cartridges but they're just you know what i mean they're okay they're not nothing that's tremendous or dependence or that makes me want to say hey guys you got to go out and check this cartridge out right now go out and grab it that cherry pie i would say guys when you're going out you're going to buy a cartridge maybe just get one or you're getting four or however many getting include cherry pie in your new one because that is a great cartridge i will say that with this one i'm going to say if you haven't tried it and you've tried all the other ones and you want to try guava cake try it and see what you think but personally i would say that with all the new strands that have come out there are some that are a lot better than this one it is really overbearing peppery um it does have that herbal taste piney taste to it which would make it pretty you know well balanced if the peppery if it wasn't so peppery and i have noticed i have noticed lately platinum vape that you get a little peppery with your indicus your indicators are a little peppery they're a little strong peppery lately not all of them not all of them i will say but some of them have been really overbearingly peppery not to where they make it it terrible but you just expect a little more balance of sweetness to the pepper you don't want that you know that stick strong peppery piney taste to overpower every cartridge and i feel like the indicas with pot with platinum vape there there's been a few out of these new strands maybe the last not the the second to last from these ones or really but i mean it doesn't make it none of them terrible like i said i don't think there's any of the new strands that i would actually be too bummed out to have gotten all of them have been good it's just some of them are really good some are just mediocre some are just regular like i said even the regular like you know peppery ones that i say are over dominantly peppery are not really the balance that you're looking for or that i'm looking for when in a cartridge still outweigh like you know prestos or them high lifes or uh even the red buds i'm sorry a lot of people um messaged me and did tell me some things about red bugs that they enjoyed or you know told me some strands to check out that they did like and that they did prefer that i probably would like and not that i didn't take your advice or i wasn't willing to take your advice i was just really put off by the first couple ones that i had so put off that i didn't really want to try any other ones so i kind of stick with my go-to cartridges personally that i want to smoke on a regular basis would be like platinum vape mkx selectively i don't mind stizzy i do like stizzy a little overpriced you know when you're talking about this lit um so my go-to ones like i said platinum vape select elite mkx would be another one but i prefer these two you know select elite and platinum vape over those two anyways so out of all even out of the worst like the elite strand that they put out it's still better than presto's top strand you know and i think presto's top string is like their tahoe g but like i said even the guava cake i'm going to give it a three and that three without the presto's 10. so that's kind of the spectrum i'm saying is you wouldn't be disappointed if you got this cartridge you wouldn't go home and and try and be like damn it i don't want to smoke this i want to go get a different one you'd be happy with it or you would you know you make it surprise you until it was gone and maybe not buy it again maybe you would like it buy it again but you wouldn't be necessarily disappointed with it it just wouldn't it's just to me it's not knocking my socks off i prefer some of the other ones over this i probably would pick you know like say uh the d trick there was a bubble detroit bubba that was a good one better than this one you know they're gob stoppers a lot of them are better than heaven are better than squava cake but it's still a stern cartridge still a good cartridge don't get me wrong and somehow well that's weird now there goes i've been using this new breeze battery that i picked up not because i like it not because the only thing is it's what's convenient about it is it charges by apple and i have an iphone so therefore i can charge it with my i don't have to get out of usb a separate charger so all my other ones are up there i just been being lazy and haven't been getting on my usb charger and charging i switched internet uh modems i got like this g or g seven or something this new modem and i used to use all my plug my usb plugs i'd plug them in the back of my modem and that's what i would charge my batteries with because my modem was right here so i could just switch on and off you know while recording or they'd be charged while i was recording i could pull them off and now that i got this new one it doesn't have that charge thing in it the usb charge so i have to put out a separate charger and all that so i've just been using my iphone charger really it's just out of laziness i don't prefer it it's not any better it's not any really any worse i have actually batteries that perform probably better than this one does like my uh uh you you can't your can uh union that one works a lot better than this one you can see it's got so many different settings on it pre-heats and stuff this one doesn't have a preheat it's really basic but it gets the job done like i said out of laziness it works for me so cherry pie four stars this guava cake only three like i said it's really peppery not too balanced with that peppery it's really overbearing but let me know in the comments what you think if you tried it i appreciate you guys i love you if you haven't subscribed think about subscribing i'll put something down here to remind you and i'll be back as soon as i can with some more reviews for", "qkCIBbk6lBA": "hello welcome to serenity vape today i want to talk about triangle trading companies delta 8 thc cartridges these are these are really cool i've got one here in a kang vape th-710 it's a nice little drop system vaporizer works really well this is something that's refined from the cannabis sativa plant and put back together but unlike some of the delta 8 thc cartridges that have come before it this is purely extracted from it is entirely from a cannabis plant that has less than 0.3 thc what that means is that not only is the product legal there's zero risk of it containing anything other than delta a thc and the 50 milligrams of terpenes that they put in to give it the same kind of effect that you would get in flour or you know a cartridge that you would get out of a dispensary the quality is good this is really cool it's it still gives you a kind of high it it's pretty strong actually it's less so than your typical your old school marijuana or the kind of carts that you'll get out of the dispensary it's safe it's just delta 8 thc 950 milligrams of it and then they add 50 milligrams of terpenes which make it much like the strain that's on the label for example this is pineapple kush and having had regular pineapple kush and having had this i'd say the experience is spot on i've tried some other strains like maui wowie which has an amazing effect and flavor i was was very awake for it it's one of the things that happens for me i right now i really like their hybrid sour space candy takes away the pain takes away any stomach discomfort i have and i'm chill the the anti-medic or rather anti-nausea stops you from vomiting uh effects of this delta eight thc it it's so effective you know it's not like i went out and i had a bunch of junk food and overheat and tried it you know but what they found about two years ago when they studied this on juvenile chemo patients was that they administered it two hours before chemo and then every six hours after the chemo it completely stopped vomiting for these kids they were able to keep their food down they were able to work through the day you know they were able to go through the rest of their day for me somebody who has celiac and ibs this is this is great you know i could be you know perfectly following my diet and i hear this about people with crohn's too where you know they're doing everything right but sometimes you just need something extra it works for that it works for anxiety it works for pain some of the strains are mellower but for the price point you know you're paying 45 for a one gram cartridge so something that i would say is just a step below medical grade it's it's pretty good especially if you can't afford a medical marijuana license um sometimes there's some serious hoops that you have to jump through to get one and not everybody who needs the assistance that medical marijuana can provide is gonna be able to get a license or a marijuana card whatever you want to call it green card i'm somebody who is very strongly affected by my marijuana and you know 25 to 35 thc and a strain of flour means i can enjoy very little before i might start feeling paranoid or too sluggish to do anything you know like getting couch locked every so often is nice but i not a huge fan i don't feel couch locked with these um i don't feel even like the beginning phases of paranoia you know that that kind of automat like mechanical paranoia that sometimes happens when you smoke like it just there's nothing you know it's not that you don't it's not that you have something in the background that's bothering you it's just boom that doesn't happen with these cartridges i've tried three of their strains so far i started out with the pineapple kush which comes in this nice little package um you can see their qr code on the back the pineapple cush i really liked for its more mellow uplifting effects uh i wasn't like boom boom boom distracted and all over the place the maui was delicious very strong you know i felt like locked in place not because my body was was melting you know as had as has happened on some some indicos i've had but just because my head was buzzing so much and what i've been vaping over the last few days is their sour space candy this so far might actually be my favorite i'm the twist in between on that one um i do get the beneficial effects of the indica i my you know any physical pain i have is turned way down uh and i'm somebody who has fibromyalgia so even on a good day i might be in pain so having something like this uh waiting at home when i'm not at work or even if i am is good for me because i can still focus mostly but my pain is negligible for somebody who has arthritis or fibromyalgia or any other widespread pain disorder i think this is really good as a product the other strain i'm thinking of trying is actually their northern lights remember northern lights putting me out and one customer has told me that they had just one hit off of the northern lights and they were out deep asleep about half an hour they slept through the entire night worked really well for them for me there's not enough of a difference to rush out and go to a dispensary this this cuts the mustard for me now it doesn't cut it for everybody and you'll still find stronger medicine at a dispensary but if that's not an option for you these are really good and even if you can go to a dispensary you might actually be saving money and getting similar enough of an effect or exactly what you need out of these cards thanks to triangle trading company for reaching out to us we really hope that you guys keep doing this i really want to try some of your other strains like headband for example so this is jonathan from serenityvape thanks for listening if you like what you saw or you

what's up guys it's your boy Freddie and today I'm going to be reviewing a product so probably that you guys have been actually texting me about and but they've been asking me about this right here it's called red sky and of course you know it's a marijuana product weed whatever you want to call you but I'm not gonna lie to you guys I'm not really a big fan of vaping or you know anything of that nature I'm really just an old-school smoker you know give me a [ __ ] join or whatever not smoke it real quick this product like I have never seen like you see you see a help this is fancy you know like of course is here in Oklahoma that's why it has a little symbol right there it's pretty cute I like a cheap at all and this is the product that's in it that I will be reviewing this right here cost me about went a $50 honestly $50 you can get it for like 60 in some places if you find it for 50 then it's a deal if you get it for 45 and that's all those posts over so of course it has this little protective I don't know what you would call this but when you what you do just take it off course and with mine because you know some people do have the lien all this straight pin I wish I had it but this cost me $10 and I was like I'm not about to know you know I mean like smoke I can taste up to 99.99 of can of orders so it's very very high potent I will say that and that's what I like about these okay so the one main thing that I really really like about like making is the fact that you know when it comes to smoking like we bow or whatever you have this awful awful order and you just don't like it you know some people when you're walking down a store you can make a smell you they start judging you you know how people are whatever well with vaping this doesn't leave a big big big smelly they're down on again this is by Leafly it's kind of you know it's a little cheap I wish I had a different one but it's whatever so what I did is just put the little thing on there twist it on there pretty good and then you're gonna just stop it in there and this is just for the airflow and yeah let me just go ahead and take a rip and I'll let you guys know what I think and of course I already tried it honestly guys I mean I really really really enjoy it I'm not gonna lie to you guys that's one of the things about that I don't like about vaping it doesn't give me my like smoke cuz I'm used to smoking smoked smoked and this is just like a little smoke you know I'm saying of course you can hit it for a longer period of time hold it now you know for a longer time and the thing is like with these if you do that and you don't take the right hit bro like you're gonna be dying you're gonna be on the floor choking coughing your lungs out so it's really really important on how careful you are with these because of course it's not meant for everybody this is really really high ponen that's what I like I've been smoking for years and you're not smoking flour whatever it doesn't do it for me no more I need a little bit higher of concentration I'm [ __ ] it the only thing I do have a problem with the angle I cuz I told you guys that it's not the first time so yes so anyways so this is one thing that does kind of kind of rub me the wrong way but like when you bind these capsule even though they're like fifty sixty dollars you don't really use up all the product like this is an old one and I know it's a little dirty and all that has hair on it but you see how much it left over and like all this I could smoke I guess you could say but it just tastes so disgusting after you know being that like you still have a good amount but like it tastes nasty you know and so I had to just go ahead just get rid of it well that's it guys thank you so much for

guy I just have a plug where he used to go to Cali and buy all these carts from there like dang beige kingpin and just be of Beyond and beyond for 20 or something like that but you know uh I like brass knuckles cuz they sell it in the dispensary they have all the ingredients and everything inside like they give you it they give you something that says what's inside and there's no like pesticides and everything like that so if you guys have the money go ahead and go to the dispensary and buy your stuff there you know what I mean don't go and get like crazy buying like those cheap

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka and i'm back here for another video boys what's good how y'all doing i hope everyone's having a good ass week so far man uh i just got off of work you feel me had a change into the x shirt had to go pack a little bowl real quick but today today is not about weed guys today isn't about flour i mean it's not about wheat today is about weed but today it's not about flour guys today is about carts and i haven't tried a new cart in a long time guys something new and today i picked up a cart that i hope is good it's called legion of bloom i'm gonna take a bong rip before i get into it but your boy he has to find a good spot to chill at smoke at get a nice little view you feel me give y'all a view and show you guys if this legend or legion of bloom is actually pretty good so let me sit down for a second yo so we're here so like i said before guys [Music] you guys know i like taking bong ribs we back to that bong grip in the beginning of every video if you guys have been um long subscribers with me you guys know that i used to take a bong rip like before every freaking video so cheers guys [Music] whoo damn it's just some good i got some good outdoor with me right now my outdoor is actually not that harsh the taste isn't that bad i mean it does taste like that outdoor it's not that bad it's not that harsh on my lungs guys but um we're not here about flour guys we're here about balloon [Music] so off jump guys man it says the monarch premium vape cartridge it's a hundred percent derived terpenes it's a distillate cart guys but it's cannabis derived terpenes and these terpenes also are sullivan less terpenes so they're not made with butane or whatnot and then also on the back it says on the ingredients it says triple refined cannabis oil i'm not sure what that means if anyone knows what that means please comment down below i would love to know what that means i'm wondering if it's like alcohol when you distill alcohol over and over so it gets less you know less strong and less like more burn on your throat and like it's more distilled kind of you know more premium so the strain that i got i got one grammar it's mendo breath and i'm gonna be real guys they are good with their packaging i like their packaging it's a nice package you just slide it up and then it also comes with this little card let me give you guys a close-up real quick here we go all right guys so it comes with this card and it says that they won the emerald cups first place in 2019 for their distillate cartridge and then in 2019 they also won third place award for their dislike cartridge so i guess they won two awards during the emerald cup one with the first place and one was a third place so their stuffs are pretty pretty good you should be able to scan them and look it up online maybe i'll do that later i'm not sure but yeah guys the oil looks freaking magnificent it looks closer to like a um to a raw garden the heck yeah guys bro i ain't gonna lie so far this legion of bloom it looks fire as hell i can't even front it looks like it's gonna be a good cartridge for me [Music] comes in a little too and also guys these cartridges are good because they have ceramic coils so it's you're getting less of that metal when you're smoking and you're getting that metal near your lungs from all those other coils that are made out of metal and whatnot these are actually made out of ceramic um made with ceramic coils and um a good brand for ceramic um coils i'm pretty sure is an avd cart but i looked on the bottom of this uh the bottom of this already and i didn't see any brand name but they do say that it's a ceramic coil inside so boom [ __ ] looking nice and gold so let's put it on a cart let's see what it tastes like man let's see what it tastes like but let me look at that see this is the raw garden it's a little bit darker than the raw garden but it's down there similar let me take a hit of the raw gardens real quick nothing beats a raw garden man that beats rawguard we're gonna take the rock garden off we're gonna put the bloom on and they actually have a logo on on the cartridge it's actually pretty nice they put a lot of thought and effort into their cartridge so we're gonna see if they put the same thought and effort into the actual oil to see if it's actually good guys all right all right so usually guys i don't like distillate i don't like distillate cards the only distillate cards that i really like are like sauce carts and stizzy carts those are the only distillate type of carts that i do like and sauce carts they're a little bit different because they add different type of terpenes to it and what not to make it a sauce cart but off a jump this actually reminds me of raw garden this i don't know man this and raw garden are pretty dang similar guys let me hit this one more [Music] time yeah i can definitely taste it tastes like a raw garden earth like you know you got that raw garden that's sweet you know the fruity fruity raw garden but this this one tastes like that earthy that earthy raw garden it's actually pretty damn good i can see why they won the emerald cup now this is actually pretty damn good it's surprising that not a lot of people actually i don't not a lot of people made videos about this i've been looking up seeing if people made videos about it not a lot of people made um videos about legion of bloom shout out to legion of [Music] bloomberg [Music] but yeah guys man i definitely recommend this it's actually a pretty damn good cart i'm actually gonna keep this one on the battery for a little bit you know what i'm saying yo i hope everyone enjoyed this freaking video don't forget to like comment subscribe man it was just a little car review i just had to throw you guys a little car review because your boy

on the clock while I break down this new cartridge down to you you me a second baby bad my bad I have to take a little quick break but yeah I'm here on the jail be bringing you a quick review on there's a neck thar be disposable cartridge straight from Colorado man no middleman no no no no friend hooked up none of that straight from the dispensary as you can see it's a hybrid blend watermelon

middleman hooked up none of that this straight from Colorado man this is real deal Holyfield all in that beautiful color man thinking that that thickness look how beautiful that is my look you seem as

I figured I'd give this watermelon to try see what it does see they got the is comforting USB ports which give me a second man while I try to take it out for you real quick hold up okay check this out because a lot of disposable pain pretty dope I had actually boss about the the clear disposable pin the grapevine will touch on the other video the previous video which is actually was filmed before Arkin I'm filming this that clear pin man that was our right foot the battery died on me pretty quick but guessing this when I can recharge man if I run low I guess second I should be charged and be able to finish the whole cartridge because that last one I had I wasn't able to finish the whole cartridge the battery died on me and there was no way to to to recharge that battery on that pen but this is a good nice looking oil it's real deal I'm excited to try it man Colorado was beautiful man I can't I can't it was just I've never been in Colorado never been to Cali you know just to go into these stores man and being able to purchase these items and trees man like it was those damn Best Buy or something know what I mean so that was pretty awesome man I was a new experience for me that was pretty dope but uh yeah man from the smoke on this right now while I get my mind right soccer function make Darby disposal can half a gram what about", "9DEwHNn1D00": "so so", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "usjtmOdVbkU": "what's up youtubers I thought images back with another review this one is Church cannabis company super premium cannabis distill it adjustable airflow cartridge advanced ceramic coil 510 threads 8 watt max ultimate vaping experience stated 7/16 2019 so that's just for the sale though THC says 70.2 and all the other all the other numbers are pretty pretty faded definitely looks like the kid I bought it from has already opened it it's got push-button just by the slide so he told me when he sold it to me that there's a good chance that this isn't gonna fit my palm and stuff like that judging by the feel and look and everything of it upfront yeah it's not gonna fit is just the circumference of it it's just way bigger mouthpieces that's a plaque heart compared to one of these church hearts right here is the adjustable airflow there's three circles yeah three own I wasn't sure if there's more than it for a second three of them on both sides so you can have all of them you know wide open or you know I guess it's just depending on how you enjoy smoking and stuff all right bomb battery no way that's that's not fit I'm glad he told me so I was able to pre charge a different battery we're just gonna go max airflow I would say that's almost like the N taste of like taking a sip out of like a McDonald's strawberry shake make that little aftertaste I would say that's what you're getting and flavor-wise out for this one so definitely a smooth hit taste real good presentation on the box to the card I would say is really good but it's why it costs more I think there's I think I spent 50 bucks I think I've also seen places on it upwards $60 yeah as I said it's got a lot of weight to it Oh that was Church Strawberry Cough if you have the money and you want to try it and your local just a local disco as it or one of your friends has it able to give it a rip comment below tell me what you like about it if you've already had this one that's a chitchat let's talk about it I mean what you liked about it we just liked about it how you feel about you know the weight and the size of the cart anything like that hit the subscribe button hit the like button if you like this video and I said I'm still working on just getting his stuff better tried to flip my camera sideways and do a different review but I couldn't figure out where stared so my eyes were just looking to the left constantly so I decided to switch up the product and do the review on this one instead I have a tiny little bit of wax I can do a review on from flight club extracts cookies cush I also have a tarantula I know nothing about it there's no sticker no packaging so it's probably just a house house blend I think you said house of dank I don't know and then I also have a platinum vape hybrid that I'm gonna do a review on call it Sunday driver so I'll get to that one in a different video you guys have a great night I'll see you in the next video peace out guys", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you

shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or medical marijuana my personal information alright yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so this video I got another car review for you guys I'm gonna be reviewing the same brand that I didn't like that the last to court review videos I think if you've seen him on Excel labs promo colors they just had a fire a steel so I picked up like I think six it yeah I picked up six cards in total so I still have two more flavors left of those to review so two flames I have left are tropical fruit and blueberry so I think in this video I'm gonna be smokin on the blueberry if you guys want to see a movie one in the tropical food and we're down below in the comments and I'll get that out yeah blueberry in this video so I'm not gonna spend I'm not gonna spend too much time going over a pathogen in this video I'll show you guys it a little bit better you guys want to see the packet more in like that detail go check out like I think it's my first or a second review on this company cuz I wanted like really in-depth detail on the packaging I'll give you a quick little look at it you'll break so the front evil labs blueberry contains cannabis so obviously um tested at 80% if you don't know how to use it it gives you instructions so and yeah so that's pretty much the package it's a half gram car the thing that I really like about these two um they're really really cheap I got doc they havethey oh I'm six cards you get six half gram cards and you get a battery like this battery right here eat more labs battery for sixty bucks so three cards and a battery for sixty bucks um I don't know if that's like ideal what they have like everywhere but at least that dispensary that I go to let the deal they have right now so oh yes I'm gonna take that off the battery so yeah this is battery right here this was just a regular stick battery evil laughs not I mean but uh it has them three different temperature settings low medium hot then it has a that preheating setting option where you gonna preheat your portal before you hit it to get like a full hit and yeah so I mean this it's pretty dope battery I mean you get it I'll be used for like the deal they have three cards and a battery for 60 bucks like 1500 milligrams that I mean like smoke shops usually sell these for like what 10 15 bucks so like I don't know how that's just like a fire SEO in my opinion let's just hop into this review with something aside this open this is something that I really like about this company really cheap it's like I was saying and they have all you small little details that are like fire like like I know this doesn't really like mean too much it's the quality of the oil that really matters the most but I I don't know I just always cool to have like some dope packaging make you know I mean so when you take a better uh yeah some once you slide it out it has this little part inside of that that has a evil labs this little white um container what do you call this so you open this up and the cards in here like I said to call the chroma colors yeah right chroma colors did I say that right I don't know but so every every every flavor comes with like a different color you've seen how this one is red so it has like a red tip blueberries blue I think this was sweet melon so that sweet melon was like a green that's just like another small little detail that they do that I think is like really really cool for especially at the price point that like I've been saying like they're so cheap and like it's all all those smaller details they do are like so dope and something else I forgot to mention it's actually a CEO to vaporize cartridge so yeah yeah blueberry cart here's little club close up of the oil said where's the public s so the bubbles right there this oil was like really really really big yes I'm down below in the comments what you guys think about the at least that looks to the oil I think it looks [ __ ] fire especially for being so cheap like I said uh you get three of these cards for 60 bucks with a battery like you really can't beat that the old my opinion and it's coming from the dispensary you're not getting it off the street so you know it's not like some fake [ __ ] like there's Mario karts or exotic you know it's not so [ __ ] like that it's actually from that's that's from like the dispensary so it like it has to be like umm Sayyaf II know what I'm saying so so yeah so just pop these a little blue blue little caps off of here we got the card screwed on to the battery I also really love like the aesthetic like the way this [ __ ] battery looks with the card on it like I mean like with this blue I mean like yeah that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire but with it any color it looks [ __ ] sick I don't know tell me what you guys think down below in the comments like I said um this video was saying this is like my review video but I'm also really interested to know what you guys think of the products - so beep like leave your guys's review go in the comments even even though you guys don't get to like actually smoke on it like I'm doing I get it like you review on like the look since [ __ ] you know I'm saying so tell me what you guys think down below if you have tried them like if you have tried this company in the past I tell me what you what you thought at the Brian you know what I'm saying but with that being said I'm gonna put this on the lowest temperature so I can like get the full at the full taste the full flavor and I'm saying so we're preheating it up right now so that way gets the it gets ready for me to hit it so it's ready for me to hit it so cheers if you're smoking along with me let's get it the thing that I am found out about these carts is like if you really want to get the full full flavor like their folk well it's kind of common sense but um like if you want like the full flavor like they taste so [ __ ] good if you put it on like the lowest temperature and like you barely rip it like you just for a couple seconds like he's like you see nothin I didn't take like the fattest trip I just kind of like hit it a little bit to get like the taste you should taste like a [ __ ] vapor oh it doesn't even taste like the wax like it tastes so good so flavor I'm already giving the flavor five out of five that [ __ ] was [ __ ] so far mmm what is that his like um it tastes so [ __ ] so familiarly I don't know what that [ __ ] flavor is but the flavor it tastes so I mean it tastes so like familiar like I've I've tasted this before somewhere like um it has like that artificial like blueberry flavor you know what I'm saying like that artificial taste but um like I don't I don't even know what the [ __ ] of your blueberry tastes like but like the article fit okay it's like the artificial flavor you're not I mean but it tastes like a really familiar like I don't know if it's like a gum or like a candy or something that that I had when I was a kid or what the [ __ ] it tastes like but I can't I can't think of it but I know it tastes like something that really really similar to something that I've had in the past but yeah like you know like the flavor on this though like five out of five like I said like it tastes like you're hitting a [ __ ] mod like oh my god I nicotine mug you know I mean like it tastes fire oh one of the best tasting [ __ ] wife spins I've had by far like a hundred percent um so I just put it on medium tempo I'm gonna take a couple fatter hits and get a little rating for the high the high I guess and the smoke so yeah Cheers [ __ ] I [ __ ] up on that one mmm that [ __ ] tastes so fire made that one more time so I mean you see it [ __ ] rip so like um the taste 5 out of 5 the way it smokes it gets 5 out of 5 the high they're not the [ __ ] best cards like I've had way better cards like if you seen in my last couple reviews I did a brand called select um select elite premium vapes um their cards are stupid [ __ ] fire but they're like 40 bucks for a half gram card which is like really really expensive but that [ __ ] is stupid fire um these are definitely not on that level but that for the price point [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire um if you ever see these in your area definitely pick them up tell me what you think of them or even if you don't have the chance to tell me what you think of them just [ __ ] pick them up because they're fire I'm not sure like but they have like their own store or what it is but I said that the price point on these were it was like 22 or 23 dollars yeah I'd definitely pick one of these up if you have a if you ever see these in your [ __ ] area definitely pick one of these up evil labs extracts are not just evil labs a cannabis and vault evolved that's what it's called that's that's the brand um yeah topaz packaging definitely picked one of them up you can't beat it for the price point in my opinion 1500 milligrams of THC a battery for 60 bucks that's that's a [ __ ] steal so the tastes on this is a 5 out of 5 but that's [ __ ] crazy I can't like it tastes [ __ ] insane the smoke do you see I'm getting like fat rips watch yeah so I don't think the camera really picked that up as well as like you could see it in person but this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um this the way it smokes you get a 5 out of 5 to the price point 5 out of 5 quality of the cart like I said I've had way better cards in the past but for the price point I think in the past videos I gave him three and a half but after smoking on them for a couple days they're kind of growing on me and I come I'm kind of liking them a little bit more so I don't know just after smoking them for the last couple days I'm gonna I'm gonna raise my score up to a four so the so the high gets a 4 out of 5 and I guess I'll keep the quality of the oil at a 3.5 Obama raised too high though for so yeah I guess the overall score at the cart a 4 out of 5 that's like the overall score for the everything combined 4 out of 5 3 cards 500 milligrams each totaled 1500 milligrams and you get a battery sixty [ __ ] dollars that's how [ __ ] steal can't beat at my opinion definitely picked them up like I said definitely tried them out here's the brand I was talking about was select this is actually Paris oh gee yeah if you want to see a ever actually did a review on this course if you want to see that go check that out but like I was talking about they're [ __ ] a forty bucks for a half a gram but yeah those are stupid fire you can go check it out if you want the review but yeah like I said this card 4 out of 5 but I still have one more left to review so if you guys want to see a review on the strain or flavor of tropical fruit tumble down below in the comments and I'll get a review out for that and then they just got some new fire ass card set the dispensary right down the road for me someone pick a couple of those up if you guys want to see some more these videos um if you guys enjoyed these like car reviews or

thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it's been around here a peace out", "UUEJMK1WCMs": "hey everyone uh this is luke with owls and today i wanted to talk to you a little bit about what is distillate first of all what is dystolos so distillate is the oil that you see in our vape carts um it is also used in our gummies distillate is something that is uh it's distilled right you you you see your um you see alcohol and they say like it's triple distilled so it just means it's more purified so for instance what you would have is you could have your preliminary extract that could be anything from an ethanol extraction to a butane extraction to a co2 extraction and the oil that comes out of there uh is basically distilled now what does that mean it's put into uh a boiling flask um uh and actually you know we can we'll take you down to the lab and we'll show you some of this stuff but uh basically um we uh we put that into a boiling flask and then the boiling flask uh is heated and when it's heated it goes up it basically evaporates and then it recondenses and when it recondenses it becomes more purified and it basically leaves some of the heavier or the the other cannabinoids that you don't want in the boiling flask and then the ones that you do want get purified and they get brought over here and there's also what is called a deep volatization that basically will also remove any of the volatile so for instance if you were to do an ethanol uh an ethanol extraction or a butane extraction when you put that into uh your your your for distillation uh the first thing that's going to come off it's going to evaporate first is going to be all your solvents so you can collect all your solvents in one area here and then you know that the the mains which is the good stuff is free of all solvents so let's take a trip down to the lab and uh let's talk a little bit more about distillation all right so here we are and uh this is a it's called short path distillation and uh and basically what is happening here is uh we have the boiling flask and the the flask is heated it's currently not doing a run right now but uh basically uh this is heated that heats the the contents of the boiling flask which would be crude oil or our conversion and then from there once that heats up at certain temperatures you will get evaporation which then will come up and it will travel down the condenser and then depending on um depending on uh where your ass will either be pulling you know the the volatiles it could be uh any solvents and then uh and then once you get off that then you get what's called your heads which is the the first fraction which again isn't really the stuff that you want and so from there you are able to purify the cannabinoids and then once you get to the end of that you can actually get uh i don't know if you're gonna be able to see it but this is basically we can take a video or a photo or something for it but uh you can basically see that there's uh stuff on the bottom here you're not gonna be able to see anything but um uh that's basically it in a nutshell so the the the undesirables are left here or they're or they're reclaimed somewhere else and uh the main uh the main parts of dislo is that's why it's called your mains um they are collected here and then from that i mean that's when they turn into like this you know so um that's how you make uh that's what distillate is and then once it turns into this purified oil you can then put it into vapes gummies edibles creams and so that's what distillate is and i hope you enjoyed the show thank you very much you", "o4m-Ad5-fq4": "so sup everyone it's gonna be my first review on my garden I got me the triple og and 381 percent THC to house every D and

one release today I'm going to talk to you a bit about our baked article to have oil of course so our big cartridges are all glass and stainless steel they are 510 threads so they should connect to any 510 thread push-button battery now the push button is important because the way that our cartridge is designed they will not work on a pull-through battery so all of our cards come with a silicon cap here on the top I recommend twisting clockwise to remove this Jack now that is 2 times if you twist counterclockwise you can potentially loosen your mouthpiece if you do that you run the risk of leaking some of the oil out on the side if it gets warm and run to the top so just twist make sure these guys are clamped on nice and tight we connect these guys to any push-button battery again ah I just screwing them into the top here on the base plate now Arbus push button batteries take 5 click to turn off and 5 flicks to turn on then you know that the battery has a good connection with the cartridge if when you push the button you get a solid steady life on these batteries we change the voltage by clicking three times and for each different voltage you'll get a different light to indicate where you're at for our batteries we right usually recommend vaporizing around 3.3 volts to 4.0 volts depending on which matter you have and what all you have I personally prefer to vaporize about 3.3 volts no higher than 3.6 now our cartridges we do not usually recommend for refills however if you are going to refill our cartridge you unscrew the mouthpiece let that guys side and with your syringe you're going to want to fill around suppose into the area that you see between the the metal post and the glass tank do not fill directly into that post and it's because if you do you'll actually clog your mouthpiece and will be able to draw if your cartridge is leaking chances are that it's leaking from either the bottom gasket or the top gasket we've actually replicated 14,000 feet at 100 reads Fahrenheit without any leakage out of the bottom so we're pretty confident that one and if that is happening then chances are you've accidentally unscrewed your mouthpiece a little bit so all that you do screw that back down nice and snug and make sure that your cartridge remains upright as opposed to buying it on slide or upside down if the oil flows into the post and it plugs your mouthpiece all you need to do your unscrew your mouthpiece okay take something long and in like a paper clip and just run it down through the mouthpiece now you should be able to clear this guy right up if the oil is a little too thin you can actually refrigerate your mouthpiece for a few minutes taking that all up and it should push out nice and smooth but you can see now you're getting a lot of that oil out you're just going to drop that back down into your change if there is an air bubble that builds up around the hole all you need to do is you need to keep the oil in order to get it to settle again you can use your body heat just hold it in your hand for a while put it in a pocket that's close to your body or run it under warm water either I personally for your life all you do one the lighter over the black part of the tank and then hold it upright to allow the oil to settle again now this is perfectly safe because our cartridges again are made of glass and stainless steel and the gaskets inside our high temp resistant silicone so you're not going to be putting any bad chemicals into your oil", "hJXaRcju6-k": "what's up everybody today we're going to be doing a uh a stizzy stizzy cart review we got straw nana and it's coming in at let's see 85 percent all right let's get into it see looking clean all right let's give this [ __ ] a shot straw nana all right oh yeah that's good okay so we definitely got a strawberry banana flavor more of a strawberry on the inhale on the exhale you get a little bit of that that banana let's let's give it another hit oh that's good man like i said man i love it when these flavors are on point man when these things drawn at it and it tastes like that good job stizzy like yesterday i did a cart review i didn't even upload it because uh i got a stizzy a live resin and it was orange float but it didn't taste like that at all it tastes more like burnt concentrate or something so like i said i love it when it it represents what the flavor says you know so props on that one okay i was hitting too so straw nana definitely would recommend it all right guys cheers", "088VoPXFNaY": "i don't know why i want to sing every other day every other day every other day is fine [Music] happy hour so this is going to be a review and then also some notes i took from dr vessel van kalk hey if there's a living dude alive that i would like to hang out with it's you dr russell you just get it like i was cool stop i was like crying last night just like releasing trauma but also because he's so on point he wrote a book called um i really want to get it it's called the body keeps the score okay but first i'm gonna put this in this friend one really interesting thing look at my neck sit down with what look at your neck okay so you know a lot of people have muscles here that you'll see when you when you turn you can see mine like that part and moi so let me sit normal so you can see i'm missing them they're absent those are called the curiosity muscles see and traumatized people don't have time to have them like you can literally tell people that are traumatized or not traumatized if they have this part of the muscle sticking out it made a lot of sense to me because we're like this all the time like unconsciously a huge thing he said whether i've heard this before or not and that's the thing about healing like [ __ ] will hit i don't want to sound like you know woke [ __ ] will hit different he's like and maybe it's just because i've had an ex had experience with people who don't understand and i'm learning it as i'm healing so i don't totally understand but for anybody that's that loves somebody that has trauma or has been through trauma and has somebody that they trust and love to explain this is the easiest freaking way it's vessel van cock's way of explaining that people don't understand trauma is not a story that happened to someone that's not trauma isn't memories i have it's not stories it's a rewiring of the brain so i've made that joke like trauma brain before because i read that in a book somewhere basically i love him i want to marry him you guys um he did the first study on uh yoga and trauma and found that trauma was more the most successful john was the most successful at healing yoga yoga is more successful than any medicine at healing yoga um where are my notes though my proper ones the rewiring of the limbic system um you said something funny it's like traumatized people aren't like usually very popular people because they're awkward and we are awkward i guess and i was thinking about like how lucky i am to have like at least a few people that i know love me even though i'm so quirky and awkward but um yeah i'll always be standing here strong for anybody that's not strong enough yet because i remember that okay okay um i mean i remember what it felt like to be completely alone and it wasn't the world's not fair toss that you know like forget the world being fair there's just like there's a lot of grace to be had for giving people that are not sorry and also continue to orchestrate duress in your life okay so one big thing okay so the difference between trauma being a story like this that happened to somebody like somebody that had been through trauma might i could i guess i could understand this when he was saying it last night why do they keep talking about that story like if somebody i would imagine like and i did see this actually i did see this actually in some way that i was seeing after like somebody that i was dating after my father passed away he hadn't experienced really any loss like his parents or anything and like i could tell like at some point it's like just get over it your dad died you know what i mean like and like depending on the relationship you have with your parents um i mean for me that was the one i always knew my whole life it would be the event that would knock me down that i would not survive and i still have a daily relationship with the fact that it has not here but just to like even have those feelings i think is i don't know i think it just makes people different like i remember i dated a guy in high school and his mother passed away like before we were together like his mom passed away when he was eight and we were like in high school we did it all through high school and he used to cry about his mom i'm like i had both my parents they were freaking happy healthy like very amazing but like i remember like it would scare the crap out of me and like i would go and be like that i love you you know but i guess everyone's different for a person that's experienced trauma that changed their brain it's not just a story that they're repeating it's physiological responses that they're basically um of it's um your being state is constantly compromise and then at the whim of like for example i made a video the other day my dog jumped out of the bed funny and like hit my elbow and like my body that's why i love the title of this guy's book the body keeps the score my body like shot into i was like hyperventilating and crying and like i was in some kind of trauma that had been triggered by telling my body remember but my mind was successful in in shoving away so it's a huge huge milestone um marker of like badassery for healing to be able to say that this happened to me and it was bad but today is march 24th it's over i can actually do that um body keeps the score mindfulness uh rewiring the brain resetting the limbic system and trauma therapy so like the curiosity muscle like people trauma don't have time to be curious we also put to the brain are shut off like the parts for creativity for imagination so it's very important for us to be in safe places where we can be creative and imaginative yeah curiosity muscle is uh absent in traumatized people ah okay so every other day um this is called everyday mimosa one gram for use with 510 thread only okay so this is one i've not tried before i skew that part down wah everyday it's an indica look how bossy it is on the back five ten thread only okay i'm gonna get my egg rolls before they burn i'm wondering it's a sativa i thought it was an indica it's a sativa i'm wondering where they're going to give me the info on the thc hey boys these are the boys that brunch juventus poised up brunch on sundays too yeah i told them about that okay so it comes in this cute little thing [Applause] okay show no info on the ttc content i guess it's just gonna be a surprise so everyone knows 510 thread it's like silly did you even fire he needs to get to the bathroom it's like a silly thing because it wouldn't fit in anything else so it's like 5 10 10 only like not say thank you for buying my product it's i i'm just kidding let's see oh there's the information 89 thc 10 milligrams of cbd i'm liking that package 127. sorry 1 15 21. two days that's my mom's birthday kinder understanding sensitive healing i like the whole medical genre but you could say something like nice like this little area is like i don't know why not put hearts instead bye it's good it's nice", "gD6NUfvKW3M": "good morning tubers my name is Matt and I'm a medical marijuana patient here in the state of New Jersey and for years I've been smoking bud break I can't roll a blunt to save my life well bong hits a nice glass piece every now and again so technology brings me to this cartridge that I I didn't discover it you know but it's new tomates the roof brand they claim its co2 supercritical extracted they also claim it tests up to 85 86 percent THC they've got several different flavors I've got a indica and Fuji indica I think you can see that okay I'll show you the cartridge real fast that's the inside the box says on the side here all natural solvent free as the size of the cartridge up top half and here's the cartridge itself a little squiggly are 4ov brand color-coordinated per flavor this purple R is the og indica they suggest that you prime them before you use it so what I'll do is and you see it's got a little rubber mouthpiece cover on there I'll take that off now this isn't the actual mouthpiece can be used as a mouthpiece I use it as a mouthpiece works great but Road does offer a mouthpiece that's attached inside I think it's a silicone mouthpiece I'm not exactly sure because robe is only available on the west coast I'm on the East Coast don't know how I got these anywhere so your average 510 thread it's an all Pyrex glass cartridge stainless steel parts it's got a ceramic wick it's um they're pretty awesome I'll read you their little info or stats card what's new it says improved cartridge the new design as a ceramic core which improves taste and flow if your cartridge appears to be less then completely full don't worry so moil has already been absorbed in the wick now from experience I've got to tell you these cards are the bomb they will empty all the way down you see that a little bit right there yeah that'll get smoked like this cart has lasted me probably five or six days and I'm a full time smoker full time like in my pocket all times I charge it twice a day like full time smoker that's here this is the sherbet flavor pretty awesome it's it's not an oily substance it's more like a gel and I find that sometimes in the cold weather just overnight kids jammed up and it won't come through you won't get a good hit okay it's kind of shitty so particular handy dandy George you gotta be smarter than it first light it you just hear it up real fast real quick spinning the cartridge around eating up the jail you'll see it fall don't spend too much time on it voila yeah it's all formed down at the bottom now okay touch make sure you don't burn yourself take a couple dry poles alright dry you'll taste it then here we go raw brand cartridges you can't get them find them cheaters", "TMteMpw4YCY": "what's good YouTube today guys 1-1 like alright before I get into this video I just want to say I drove literally over like I think close to an hour to go to verified spot where I could get this and I'm gonna go ahead and put that spot right here so you guys can to see like that it's legit so as you guys know heavy hitters right here it has a reputation it's been getting a really bad reputation because there's been a lot of counterfeits a lot of fakes and then you know a lot of bunk [ __ ] going around was like these these things have been sold on eBay the cartridges in the packaging for like five cents and you know people have been filling them with hot dog water man and then they used to be one of my favorite cartridges so you guys go back in my reviews I used to reviewed like five different ones of these and they were so amazing I remember everything all the time smoking them I'm just like do this this is the most enjoyable moment of my day you know so mmm let's get let's get straight into this man heavy hitters purple punch I'm sure you guys a close up I haven't opened it this is a brand new brand new packaging this is my first time getting a heavy hitters in over a year at least a real one so let's go get into here you see the heavy hitters purple punch alright let's go ahead and look at that oil man app that bubbles not gonna move that's huh that's one way that you know you'd see nope it's not moving Bo and this is the new packaging has the heavy hitters down there push to release purple punch it has the THC percentage cannabinoids all that good stuff and then so it says push to release and then I'm guessing you just pull okay no apparently not let's see push to release how hard do you have to push man I'm literally better break it doesn't want to come out it's probably cause of this sticker though let me give me one second guys so push to release right here and then boom you get out the packaging heavy-hitters is very very nice holographic super clean man get out of the packaging boom look at that beautiful oil dude wow this is what a real heavy hitters is supposed to look like none of that bunk ass [ __ ] moving as soon as you flip it upside down so get rid of that I'm not sure if a sticker supposed to come in here or not but I'm guessing not so get rid of that here's a packaging and then like that still hasn't moved still hasn't moved look at that amazing boy so back to the video main when you go ahead and drink some water shout out to hydro class keeping my water cold at all times you gotta stay hydrated it doesn't matter what what time of the day it is doesn't matter what are you smoking up you gotta stay high you're so heavy hitters I'm excited man whoa alright so I missed these tip I honestly like the tips these cartridges have to be one of my favorite ones they just look so clean man whoo I mean I don't even yeah I'm like a purple like a great kind of so first we're tried on the ooze battery man hopefully this thing works last time I tried trying on the Gras garden didn't work so sitting nice and flush these cartridges always stay nice and flush tell your truth that's why they have on the poems problems because some of the batteries they don't have these little openings right here to let the air go through so you have to keep it kind of loose but with this one it does have the hole so you don't have to worry about that so 3.3 volts and then let's see man let's see your cheers boy so you guys are 18 and over 21 and over y'all know the deal man Mich you guys are smoking along with me y'all all that good stuff let me know what you guys are smoking on if you guys ever tried a real heavy hitters let me know what your experiences it was with like what flavor did you like what flavor didn't you like and et Cie so yeah choose guys yeah right off the bat it has that og heavy hitters taste dude has that taste that like it tastes like piney and that's the signature of the heavy hitters in my opinion you know that little piney tastes like it tastes so nice and so like earthy and that's what I like tasting about this like the one other strain I think it's at the Northern Lights oh my gosh amazing dude this purple punch though so far I'm getting a very very hint of the purple punch like if he has ever smoked purple punch who whether it be from my the purple punches that I have some up from his jungle boys loud pack and bear farms so all dude purple punch is just like one of those flavors that's going around in a super popular but not a lot of people can perfect it you know they put fillings in it like when making consec concentrates especially they put feelings that make it taste like like you know like kool-aid stuff like that for example astiz II I'm not bashing on Suzi there are purple punch is amazing but it tastes too much like candy doesn't taste like you know wheat it doesn't taste like that good good man this punch this tastes exactly like they got a purple punch flower you know just squished it put some mother did their disel it and then mix it in with the distillate and then boom in a cartridge that's it it's very nice the cold filtered just I love the cold filtered on these man so like I said like I took two three hits and the oil still not moving there's still no oil no bubbles going up man this is definitely I'm happy I caught this man I'm happy like I went drove an hour away to get this man so off with the ooze battery we're gonna try it on the bat mod the one you don't really these are just pull and then screw it on slap it on there it looks pretty nice I just don't like that these are like super wobbly so yeah cheers guys so not too much power you get you get a lot of flavor not too much clouds I'm still don't I still don't get a hype and this is this is tested at 90 percent total cannabinoids so I mean I don't know though we we have to check that the website I might have to check at the website out after the video until you as if it's legit or not you know cuz heavy hitters lot also they had I think they had pesticide fails I'm not too sure about that I mean I was gonna use the bat mock but to heat up the oil but it looks like the oil is doing pretty good still no air bubbles so don't need it you guys didn't know this is the one that you put the little tubing around and it moves the wax on top so yeah put this back on the O's and then we're gonna take some hits off of 3.5 setting and then see what those are 3.6 get some heavy hitters in there alright so cheers guys I'm gonna do five to seven second pulls on this you would just just get try to get nice and baked so yeah it's pretty good for the most part I'm getting like some pretty decent hits off of this and the oil still you know just chilling dude still hasn't moved that's what I like to see it is moving a little slightly ever so slightly though and that's what you want out of a cartridge man I'm getting the the mellowness I'm getting everything it's a very very mellow it's not very too like strong in your face and that's kind of one thing that I've noticed about purple punches like when people make the Pens like I've never had a purple punch that hits me in my face you know it's always channel like subtle very mellow and this is it you know heavy hitters brings you just that but I feel like they for sure have I don't know I don't know if I can say they have the best purple punch but it is definitely talked to I would have to go back and see what concentrated cards have the purple punch like for example raw garden is killing it if you guys haven't seen my last video go check that out this one right here is the berry punch and it's amazing dude I got this one the raw garden so amazing this these guys perfect every single cartridge ever like their their cartridge like I mean I know I don't want to bring it in while I'm reviewing it disel it this is a refined light resident but you know the purple punch on these are amazing so get back to the review man we're gonna take one last rip and finish it out for you guys and then this is going up on Monday by the way so I hope you guys have an amazing week you know go follow me on instagram at back without if you guys enjoy the video so far if you guys are new here go ahead and hit that like comment and subscribe button so cheers guys yeah whoo it's a bit it's very very smooth dude that's one thing that I can say about it very smooth if he like I could probably take like 20 hits of this no problem it doesn't really have me coughing that much as like the raw garden usually does the raw garden has me freaking dying after I hold in for two seconds and but yeah it's a very nice I'm getting the very eyes are going down my head is probably starting it's starting to think freely and I'm just chilling you know that's kind of what you want out of a pen I already see I had to take a lot of hits to get there I mean I see they lower air bubble on top just kind of um opening up a lot more and that's probably just because the wick is getting waked up and but yeah man it's not bad it's definitely a comfort of the price that I got it for it's nice like I said I'm gonna put the dispensary right here and on the in the description below if you guys ever in the area and want to go check them out they have two amazing prices so yeah one last hit for you guys are for the boys for the boys and hold it how very very smooth like I said yes so overall heavy hitters um what I buy it again probably not and the only reason why I wouldn't buy it again is because heavy hitters were back in the time you know they were great they had their they had the competition on lockdown they had they were beating everybody that's just because there were so many people doing this you know doing this game and then now that there are so many other people's like you know like these raw guard and I'm I know I talk about them so much but they're just a perfect example because they bring for the perfect price in the perfect product into the table and then you know like heavy hitters you can either get it at a very low price like I did or get it at a very high price and that's kind of what a lot of people are doing right now because they're sort of scarce like around there is and it just sucks but yeah I definitely wouldn't cop this again you can easily get something better for equal price and yeah but unless you want to try something original something that's been around for some time you know you know like if you're new to the to the scene and you want to try something that's been around for a while I recommend definitely recommend going for these you know to get a get a taste of what people in five years ago we're tasting the four years ago or tasting you know and yeah it's pretty it's good it's a good smoke overall though I'm not gonna lie just my tolerance I'd I wouldn't want to buy it in so yeah heavy hitters eight out of ten I would say you know the high is a good 7.5 the taste is amazing I would eight point five and then you know the Terps they were there they were there there but like I said heavy hitters isn't very chirpy chirp central but yeah overall that's a good quality project I would buy it I wouldn't buy it again though you know we're just rambling at this point so I'm gonna go ahead and end the video here if you guys enjoyed the video like I said they would like comment and subscribe button we'll catch you guys later", "QiE3bvVQO8o": "quick introductory video instructional video on how to use the leak proof cartridges now this is actually a cartridge that i've used already so i apologize about that but i have placed it back in the original starting position so first thing that you want to notice in any cartridge if it's not hitting it usually means there's a space right on the bottom here that means there's a space here but the leak-proof portion has not been activated we pull the top off when we're ready to use it now avoiding touching this sorry avoiding touching this blue rubber stopper here because we don't want to pull that off unless with that tamper with it we want to grab the top classic portion here and notice this part here I'm going to press down and turn okay and I can pull it back up for you so you can see the movement there we go so again now touching the blue thing not pulling it out you're going to grab the top and a press you're going to turn as soon as you do that in about 10 seconds the product is gonna be ready to use grab the tip click it back on give it 10 seconds or so and go ahead and use it", "WVnhfdr6j_o":

these things about the plate nothing fixed it so I just there's this section right here where the smoke comes up the back of it I'll show you what to do you just take top off grab like a zip tie they're flat they're long and skinny there's a groove right there if you take you see it's going inside you push this all the way down sometimes the oil likes it get clogged up in the side of right here in the cylinder so you just start poking around in it turn on your pin and I've already done mine so I don't need to you just jam it around there a little bit it will get clogged up and you it's perfectly safe and you turn it on while you're poking it and it will start to clear up the clogged oil that'll fix your issue for you and get you burning and smoking again alright that's my video thanks bye", "IZevn2phLbw": "[Music] let's go right right right right right right what's up friends this time i'm coming at you with the gather from soleil this is the old 510 or vape cartridge there

natural berry and watermelon flavors it says so should be tasty i'm guessing i picked this one up for i think it was 39.99 at the store kind of looking forward to a bit of a cbd one in there anyway

don't know but they're just pins and I got two of them because it sucked having to charge these because you have to charter for so long and they don't last at all like no maybe the last few like to be honest so paralyzed when I casted it fully charged so I got two so that one can always be charged but then you have this you know if you use it you know not like don't fry you know the comment or something but just hit it for like a second you'll be cool to second and you'll be very cool and then these just don't like you have to be hitting them like I don't know if you guys seen my previous videos but if you like but um yeah if you see me in my other videos like it takes me a minute you know to hate this thing like I had to like hate for like ten seconds I just like the same cloud as in like two seconds there's decent piece ahead okay so in my opinion we've got it this way why actually got okay here's the funny thing I already had this it was like stored in a hidden place and then I just came across bit because I was having trouble with these we got to just because did last at all but this on fully charged battery allows me like two days to be honest see look okay hope you guys can see that but that's what it's at right now and the reason that it's almost dead well it's not almost dead actually my last point the rest of the night but um it's because I haven't even charged it isn't that crazy it's stored in that it's not a box but it's like it's like a storage box you know like if you have these like box shelves I guess and you want something you know to put in it you get this box thing you put in it that's what it was and all this time I think it's honestly been like maybe a couple years to be honest one year okay because it still had my little trip on it no I did not hit the dripper okay so that's basically you know the video because I given you guys you know my opinion about these yeah and it's because you know I have tried them both so I know the waiver I don't really think I know what I like and I like something that's easy to hit takes 2 seconds and gives me a big cloud like I definitely be not like something that takes 10 seconds to a small cloud and lasts maybe half the day and on these Justina I don't know if you guys know if you you probably have bought one of these before if you like baby or something but the charger that comes on these comes on these cons with these is so fragile I guess that's the word to use like I have been through maybe like maybe three or four so this is a charger right okay so this round piece in there you screw this and they're like this and you got a scene like what has happened to like my past ones is that circle thing will move out of place and it will just rip the wires because it's connected with two wires so it would just like break a wire too you know or the plastic you know if you screw it on too tight the plastic well you know I guess will like snap on its own you know cuz it's too tight because it's like because you can't screw it on too tight and then you have to have this I mean I guess every trucker has but look with this you can use any Android charger and any I guess that's what you call her in the Android charger that's what I always call I don't know I wouldn't be for an Android because my ps4 controllers use the same charger I don't know but you use that like this does not have a battery okay I don't know better as a built-in back so I can't even that's it", "G7GklIFSSAU": "Delta time THC there's now a huge thread regarding that and don't live when we had a fun little for it for take a little for a layman's background so so depending it specifically yeah everybody's different and I'll all have their own special ways of a festival but depending on where or how the different pieces of the molecule are laid out you you know the difference between THC delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail and no boxer group carboxyl group and in another thing there's Delta 88 C which has gotten really popular with the water clear trend and people would you know they would throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and stuff into their boiling flask and then they'd start distilling it and it's coming out beautiful water clear they sent test results or they'd sent testing labs and then it's yeah like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually we started they got standards for Delta 88 C then started quantifying that there's more THC in us that there is but then there's still a little missing piece that like you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids and this water clear stuff that you know it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and these are things that happen through different reaction their reactions that happen through heating and the presence of acids and bases and given the different environmental things or what was sprayed on those so that that can actually be a big indicator what's happening into the reactions as well so so good all that distillation method we're like you put stuff in a pot it boils at different temperatures and all that well throw catalyst in that pot that you don't know is there like you know people spray put sulfur on their plants or people you know certain things get sprayed on plants and when you concentrate that thing in a hot flask under vacuum where fires and fire attack there's a whole bunch of ways you could do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC that until recently was it is yes in different income in different ways they affect all three of those can affect a single person completely different no they've been discovered but they're only being mass-produced yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows about him and he has and we are just now mass producing them because we have the freedom of the market to start and start playing and then we also have the competition in the market to try to make the clearest most beautiful looking oil which you know well it used to be Delta 8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm saying historically historically when they first started getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil it was Delta eight and they would do this refluxing carbon acids and but but but yeah and that was it then they would use a catalyst in the flask that they were boiling in one we're talking about people who appreciate the clarity that clear net the secret is that the consumer is that an expert consumers okay and what's your opinion on consumers have been led to believe that the clear the oil is well and and and that clear could come from a lot of different things it can be cut with another clear oil that it makes you know just diffuses what color is in there there's a lot of things that can clarity is definitely an indicator of purity though it was an indicator but the a slight yellow amber tint the these are little little atomic level refractions that are happening with chromophores that hold into the the tail end of the molecule these these are what a chromophore is uncle mela these they're they're basically like atomically small things that will refract light at a different color so you have so by breaking that bond you you like that's when people distill with certain things on the flask you can break that at that chromophore bond and it you can also break that bond by through chromatography as well which people eventually developed a method for Delta 9 THC does anyone clear water clear yeah and it that was just a method of taking a single pass distillate and then passing it through a series of usually magnesium silicate or floor so actually and then but different color remediating adsorbents that were also being used to remediate past asides and they still are used to remediate pesticides and it just happened that you make water clear delta 9 after remediating pesticides properly as sometimes depending on the oil and what kind of colors and that the condition THC 8 and 10 have been known for and their-their prevalent in the same way that THC is in Canada like there is it kind of like a is it a totally different cannabinoid that is in very low percentages in well zombie health of ours not so much on the cultivar it's a reaction through processing so you're not gonna have those you're not gonna have a bunch of Delta eight or delta10 any in your flowers you're gonna have it in a kind of a crazy their isomers correct and it was the one thing everything we're talking about is like the ability to narrow the bands of what you're capturing well if you cuz you're right it's it's these little slices but the only way that's possible is that we've now created these massive machine that will process a lot so we get bigger trends you know we we see information come out of plant material from farms all over California grown differently going different ways different yields different strengths different compounds or the makeup of the cannabinoids in that specific strain like it's really interesting we get to see a lot of those so at the same time as we're narrowing the focus and really like getting to chop down into you know now we're we just picked up a machine that will separate out individual cannabinoids so you can collect them individually it's a centrifugal partitioning chromatography this company called rodeo cron they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry THC eight and ten are kind of like mine or like other cannabinoids that we've known about it but haven't been able to isolate so on the market are we gonna eventually see like THC eight tinctures and THC ten tinctures in the same way that we see other kind of my hair cannabinoid totally and we've been seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of THC eight cart hay in cartridges and there is subsequently a decent amount of Delta ten THC that's in there well no they're just calling it if you're buying a card off the traditional market you they're saying it's one thing but who knows what really is in that cartridge right so but because you can take garbage oil and by attorney by doing this process to convert it to Delta eight clean it up to make it look clear a lot of guys do that ii buy a really cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction of that off and this really nice-looking oil and then it's just cheaper the way that that's produced then I like water clear Delta nine it takes extremely expensive absorbance and a process to do it with the Delta eight you throw some activated carbon in their flask and if you distill right here you can get water clear I mean there's a few other a few other parameters to change but you just dump a bunch of garbage in your flask and then just mix it with your oil and your oil is coming out nicely that was what a bunch of people were doing to fix their dark oil especially in the early day when people really weren't distilling very well", "ia6D2bYffEQ": "what I put up your boy RORO coming in raw no thumbnails no edits no none of that I got a quick review for you guys on how to stop this clog until the complete problem is fixed I've been already puffing on this right here this is the indica world where I'm in right now with this 8 but it's also the hotbox Edition so check me out the top if you can't get the top off easy warm it up a little bit you know what I mean once you screw the top off boom that middle of steel pole has a hole in the middle take a small napkin that's rolled up into a small like little needle like form put that into the middle turn it the way that tightens it so it goes right in you put that in like a little ways boom pull it out and you're not wasting much oil it's just a little bit in there that's making it clog put the other side in there this is so easy put the other side in there get the other little piece out boom put your top back on screwie dewey louie and voila boom the clog is gone run no Club no club if it does keep plugging do it like this where you puff it like that lose a little napkin to get the little stuff out but you don't have to tighten it all the way you can test it like that to see if it's clogged before you tighten it all the way and get the little stuff out the middle pole until it's all tighten put your top back on there's a black spacer underneath this cap right here though this little spacer right here this has been implemented into the cart as a way to prevent this clogging here guys so things are being worked in the back office but improvise as you go until it's all the way done coming in Rodge should wear RORO giving you little tips and drips on how to get the best out of your roll hope you like it subscribe to the channel if you're new subscribe to the channel hit the notifications

only seemed to irritate your understanding is not required only your obedience beyond your way sir this time when the night to have leave the world beyond the door seem more sorry about that beyond chapter the winds of winter god I love me some george RR martin another thing I like is liked about that we put some light on this okay and he's heard blood that be light and there was and it was good so how you guys doing how you been what you doing huh long time no see ah that's quite been there since yesterday well as you can see we've had a change of venue that's a sore subject so I'm not really gonna get into that right now well what I am gonna get into is a review of these new pens that I've been trying to know that are freaking amazing hold on a second I'll show you what I'm talking about now I have chance to grab a hold of some [Music] Mario Kart pens these are all-natural lab tested no PG nope EEG no VG I guess it's like vegetable oil on other things that give you like popcorn long stuff like that no contaminants or pesticides detected in compliance with prop 215 section below do not drive or operate heavy equipment keep out of the reach of children unlawful to redistribute alright so as you see we have three different flavors well they're not really flavors these actually what I love about these bins is they're strange specific these are not flavors added to it it just uses a really cool picture to advertise the actual strength so for the fire oh gee you can see here there is Bowser yeah Bowser right I believe it's Bowser yeah Bowser sorry it's been a while so I played Mario and this I mean they'd say Mario karts but obviously this is Donkey Kong if you can see that is that brain you see it here my mother did is it I don't know I'm kind of curious about I know it's like gorilla glue like the actually like this like this yeah I didn't still in the garage in case you were wondering it's just a really fancy garage yeah so on the gorilla glue kind of curious on what that substance is there that he's squishing is a really gorilla glue or is it go real like a loop you know um as I am and finally we have Weaver huh weird he went on the wheat we already did this one sorry and finally we have Wario and he is the brand in case you cannot read that cookies the breed should I say cookies so we have fire og as Bowser to get [ __ ] up on that one gorilla glue as Donkey Kong a gorilla fitting and wah do his cookies which happenstance gorilla glue and cookies are hybrids and fire oh gee is it indica yeah so let's get the show on the road we are starting with the fire og takes your wondering what kind of battery I'm using is an eye stick power I've had it for like two years and this thing is freakin amazing I mean I'm in a wheelchair I dropped this thing almost on a daily basis I've ran it over with my wheelchair like twice and this [ __ ] is still [ __ ] kicking oh and you can run it way down and use these small refillable the refill pins and you'll lock you lock it right cuz I've learned to hear these up on accident then I got like figure out I'm going to use a syringe like draw the little I'll put it another one that's still working so if you do get one of these make sure you lock it on like three to five dip it in our pop pop you like your quill but that's what's three point three watts is what I got and that's to get a good flavor and what I'll do is I'll turn it up to like a 3c I got a lot I got unlucky then over it up to like 3 8 or 3 9 relock it cuz you don't wanna burn the coil up especially when you got money invested in the oil that's in there and need the medicine hmm yeah you get a lot more oh yeah that's a good stuff I'll always have loved fire oh gee though and this really does taste like the breed um this is probably good you see how much I've been swimming around it's probably gonna be one of my favorites oh yeah bookshelf I like to keep like memorabilia and stuff some knives for grandpas to supply that look at this freakin bowie knife right here I just inherited sadly lost the grandfather recently and almost had a little breakdown but we're doing good now my grandma gave me this I have a matching one from my grandfather k-bar I had a handle I don't know to match this one so it's like a matching samurai said you know like but it's an American bowie knife and k-bar right doesn't get much better than that right you want a bar lover quick story then each point is that each one of these were the possessions of each of my grandfather's that one was my grandfather the cowboy and moonshiner and general alcohol you know to the day died you mean when he was not long I took home the CB handle outlaw you know imitating him and learning from him this is an actual Vietnam issue K bar that was used by marine in the field and I took it to a knife maker recently say knife maker that did that and uh this one I need to polish it up though it's a it's been sitting out in the shelf since got brass is corroded you know and then he had possibly it again this was blackened or gluten steel you know gun blued steel so it was black so he had to polish this thing for hours to get it any kind of shine out of it at all just good my grandpa had you know God blue did so many so many times over the years to keep it from rusting um sadly I've lost both my grandparents but I have these two minutes to remember them by into your mortal lies my thoughts on them sitting on my bookshelf playa visualize them and see them remember them every day that's the way they should be if you leave this world and people don't remember you then you didn't make an impact so I feel like by not remembering my campus or memorializing them on our bookshelves we we are forgetting them and leaving them in the past yeah I'm getting a little motion let's go back to the testing ah gorilla glue this was for you grandpa the general outlaw and the moonshiner yeah I tell you a funny story yeah I was like 10 to 12 years old you know almost old enough to know better we were in the hug Club and we would go down to the woods even that come on with me grandson we're gonna go water some tomato plants I always was wondering like what the hell are these tomato plants doing way the hell out in the woods away from the damn farm you know like away from the farm the farm house and not even really on our property just property where our cows were allowed to graze just think it was a state land actually he's dead now so you know who cares I'm confessing to a crime that I committed when I was a teenager and had no idea that it was even a crime until I was thirty right okay so long story short or water in these these these tomato plants and after about six months you know I asked my grandpa why don't these tomato plants ever produce any tomatoes and what the [ __ ] are those things on top of them and then he he told me the gig but he didn't tell me the gig but I don't really remember what he told me I'm just no subverted he probably wouldn't think he probably took me his store bought me ice cream like subverted my brain waited from that right good job grandpa because it took me a long time to figure it out I love you but uh you know he he was a man beyond his years and in thoughts and ideas and the way people you know that's why it became a bootlegger because he thought that it was wrong that they took this thing away from us that we had so all of our lives it was like air or water you know you can't take alcohol away from somebody when it's so readily available we can't take a plant from the way so money but it's so readily available all over the planet you can grow it anywhere you could make alcohol anywhere you can you know it's not like they they couldn't stop alcohol during Prohibition and they're not going to stop marijuana in the modern time if if they think they can they're stupid and if you think that they can you're stupid because the clear evidence of all the thirteen seventeen states or whatever that of Divac be either decriminalized are completely legalized in three states that have made it recreational it is what we cannot have a country divided on the subject this is one thing that I think all Americans can stand together very easily and you know what it's really hard to think about war and all that when you're then a peace circle pass it around enjoy we pass around a peace pipe that's all I'm gonna say that's what I'm gonna end this on so do yourself a favor go sit down in a circle with your friends pass around a joint or a peace pipe and spread the love right because that's what we need to do to to get these laws enacted reacted changed whatever we want you know like to get the legalization of the recreational usage and the you know people who should have the right to use it with for religious purposes I'll completely empathize with the Rastafarians in every state in our country who cannot consume the like holy vessel of their church legally that is insane to me it's just a plan it's just the plan you know we need more more knowledge and forethought in this world our what is possible what we should imprison our people for and I wish a [ __ ] would tell me with my paralyzed self double amputees that I'm breaking the law this is my medication just as much as all of this all of this the doctors want you to take that crap shove it down your throat every goddamn day but then wouldn't you pop for a piss test they want to jump all over you and make you go to [ __ ] drug court or something you know it's insane what without world is coming to what a person in a wheelchair I'm just gonna right now what an individual paralyzed double an TT should not have to jump through hoops and and be treated like like a drug seeker or or a junkie would they go to doctors for help and that's the truth that's my experience", "wZBa-u0WKss": "alright guys I'm going to be doing a review of some cannabis products with this line of videos like bait cartridges waxes shatters things like that I'm a here in Las Vegas I'm a medical patient in Las Vegas my name is Gabriel and I figured I don't see a lot of videos on Vegas products or you know too many too many reviews on the dispensaries or the growers or the brands so um I wanted to get some of that information out there because I'm pretty sure there's people who are going to be here coming here or are here that would like to know something about these products before the bio from a like objective point of view because I don't make anything if you buy them so the first product I'm going to be doing today is called the Jazz cabbage it's a disposable bait cartridge and I'm a big vague connoisseur I've had a lot of apes out in in Colorado in Denver and so it's I've got a pretty wealth of experience to kind of line these things up against in Colorado like I've had Pat Penn and focus labs Indigo Pro there's a couple other ones that I'm not thinking of that are kind of the EBU Pat I know I've said Pat Penn can't remember but I've had many many many many many and so this one is called the Jazz cabbage and what struck me about this one I got it at the top-notch dispensary by seen it at other dispensaries and they've got a Facebook page that I've liked as well is that and they've got a really classy cover and that's what kind of first gravity advertisement I guess the cover because it's got like these little jazz players and it's got like jazz cabbage which I assume is some old term for marijuana since it was like so kind of linked to that type of jazz and like african-americans so which is cool I think it looks interesting and it's that like cool art but what also grabbed me about it says a hundred percent organic so that's an only a group called clean green certified are the ones who did this and tested it for it's like organic miss if that's a word but it says 100% organic premium uncut co2 extracted cannabis oil so naturally since its co2 it's a solvent list it's a so that's really good i and it's a point five milliliter vape disposable I'll kind of open it up to kind of let you guys take a look at it when you open it and it opens because this little flap on the end to pull out so you can just pull it out and when it opens it over it's kind of like a ring like an engagement ring to be honest because see comes into this little thing and you pull it out and it's really really classy now these are sixty but almost self camera these are 60 bucks out the door at a at top-notch I've seen them as high as 75 dollars at a or 80 dollars where I think that comes with the whole cartridge kit could I just needed the the Veit cartridge I didn't need like the battery or anything but I got it a top notch which is over on Stephanie buy like Whitney and they're 60 bucks out the door and this is their pink oil which they've got like two or three different flavors and this is their pink and I have to say it's uh yeah when you bring it out gets like that this little mouthpiece on top little mouth covered piece on top and you just a 5-10 thread so it's pretty Universal all you got to do is I have any 510 thread atomizer and you'll be fine and you just pull this little thing off there you go you're puffing away and it's it's a it's it's a really nice unique little cartridge it's got a great taste onto like the actual review of the product it's got a really good taste reminds me of the rx green it's a bait cartridge in in Colorado and they're also it's very very very tasty and tasty and average and I kind of like generic sense like it's not tasty in a specific strain kind of way it's tasty in like it's just the greenery it tastes like buds but like an indiscriminate taste of just like it's very but it's very very flavorful so it makes your mouth feel very green so that's a good thing and it has a very good potency it has a very very good potency it uh when you hit it a couple of times like my I mean like I said a great potency grit and for potency and the combination of that and taste I honestly believe now I might regret this later but um honestly believe it's probably one of the best I've ever had but it's not the best when it comes to potency and taste I've had tastier ones and I've had more potent ones but I haven't had one as tasty and as potent as this particular one uh together at the same time so definitely worth it I definitely think it's worth the 60 bucks kind of burns a little fast I I talked to somebody and they said it's kind of more like Gaby so I don't know like how this thing burns or if it uses like what mechanics are in here that burn the oil but it seems to burn a little fast but damn if you don't get some really good hit so like I'm not saying that that it's not worth it or like it's not like like the ends don't justify the means but I will say that it comparatively to other cartridges just seem to burn a little quicker than I normally would like another quick well interesting critique on these things that I don't haven't really experienced in other vape cartridges like as prevalent is this one is that like mmm sometimes we get stuck and from what I talked to somebody about it as a dispensary and they said that because it's like I guess this particular their particular brand of oil is very thick and that sometimes I get clogged II but I mean it is really crazy sometimes like sometimes it's it almost frustrates me like how like how much I won't be able to hit this thing not trying to discourage it like it's not it's not crazy bad like I would buy another one but it's definitely something that I will take in consideration in buying another one okay there you go I got it alright now I'm going to take a hit so you guys can take a seat of I'm using these generic it's a good it's a good it's got a got the temperature gauge on it so it's a classy one but it's probably not I don't it's good so it's not the one that it comes with a jazz cabbage that like they have their own bait kit that you can buy so I'm pretty sure if you use that one it's probably might be better for it I don't know maybe not so but here we go definitely got a really good hit Jos got to study at first but it came through really really good if I build up the love's really really good you can see that bruise pretty room FY it looks very tasty I was getting down to the end I didn't review it right out of the box because I hadn't really planned on doing that but um so it's kind of at the end but it's still very tasty even towards the end very tasty very potent like I said well worth the $60 burns a little fast but I if if that's because like and it needs to burn that way for you to get the hits you're getting I'm pretty comfortable with that it's got this cool little airflow thing that I didn't show you guys before I took the hit um these three little holes here I might not be able to see them but like there's three little holes there and you can kind of like move it around the top and Swizzle it and it kind of creates different airflow so like if you want like a massive amount of airflow or if you want like a smooth stream of air flow you can kind of like dictate that to your liking at the end of the day the jazz cabbage is a very good product I would I would definitely buy it again and I would want to try their other line of oils to see what they taste like and how potent they are definitely worth another buy like I said the only cons is that it does get stuff sometimes actually not sometimes quite frequently and uh mmm that would really that would really be Oh and it burns a little fast but like I said it might be hinging on the one you getting those big hits but then I mean maybe it's not so like if it's just I don't know but that would be the only critique other other than that great vape very good for the price very tasty very potent good on the go uh and yeah so this is Gabriel was the final take on the on the on the Jazz cabbage cartridge a co2 uncut oil that is available here in loss of I guess and if you have any comments any questions please feel free to drop them and I'm going to come out with some other some other video other videos just critiquing some of different brands of bake cartridges waxes shatters um you know anything that I feel somebody might need to get a review on to get a better understanding and I will also see about reviewing dispensaries if not on location if I'm not allowed to do that like by some legality then now we'll just do it like from my apartment and we'll just sound I'll just talk about them and highlight some points about you know the the dispensary experience in those particular ones and which ones I find like are you know I like the best or you know and why you know which is more important and so we'll see how that goes and we'll see when that comes but yeah feel free to like subscribe share whatever and we'll see you the next time around", "2RWJYgjCpMk": "[Music] what's up guys I burned a 420 I'm back with a new review I got told you I had the happy Stix yesterday and I have happy Stix sunset gelato which is a hybrid it is a point five cartridge if you see this right here here's the California symbol there's a hybrid it comes with a little thing telling that it's premium cannabis vape concentrate no cartridge in the back guys you have your lab test where it was tested it was at the hive lab LLC here's the little code they give you it is 83 point 96 percent THC and it is 0.53 to 2 point 65 percent on CBD and it also tells you when it was manufactured when it was packaged and when it expires it was manufactured February 27 to 2019 packaged the 28th of February 2019 and it expires on 2020 in February so you literally got a year to smoke a point vibe that is not that bad at all you can also find on my happy sticks and I'll tell you right now guys in California they they gave me a little undies just for China in the first time so I got three for the price of like one actual like real heavy hitters and a free battery which is not that bad at all so you pop it off on the back like that comes in as little doobie tube look at this look at that that little smiley face right there this is happy sticks in the back look at that bubble guys don't even move you pop the doobie to route slide it up look here's your cartridge here's come to green seal to tell you that it's a hybrid the purple one is an indica which I've started to notice and look they have the flat tip like the old kingpins and they don't have anything at the bottom guys because they baby having all that [ __ ] at the bottom Dee's don't you can get a worry about under that we're gonna try this out on the happy Stig's battery I got and cheers let's see saw sunset gelatos okay it is pretty sweet it does taste like a fruit flavor basically I just tasted a little bit of pineapple for some reason it tastes a little bit of strawberries as well but it was pretty sweet compared to the the indica I had forgot the name of did lazy og this one's better the flavouring on this one is way better and really smooth guys like they don't really hurt your throat but they do pack a punch once you take a couple in-house let's see the second here guys my bed is early in the morning down here this is good I'll tell you right now because the first thing guys smoke today in the morning and already got me baked for eighty-three point 96 percent THC it's pretty damn good my eyes feel really low it does feel like a hybrid guys it doesn't make you like tired it kind of has me uplifted a little bit at the same time slake made me a little bit tired but compared to the indica this indica from yesterday it had me extremely tired because I got here pretty early and they added me extremely tired by like six o'clock in the afternoon this one I think this is gonna have me up but at least a little bit tired close to the end of the night but that's what I'm looking for basically if you haven't heard of these guys happy sticks the flavouring and the high ten out of ten they actually deserve it they are they do have the lab tests right here you don't have to be looking for real or fakes with these and like I said guys stay high stay tuned comment and like down below and don't forget to subscribe and Cheers because I got more coming soon [Music]",

exciting news for you from Rove for new disposable pens from Rove all the same flavors you're used to right now they've only got Skywalker og tangi and wahwee og while we the most popular flavors by far four row but check it out this is going to make your arsenal complete it's got 0.4 grams of oil same oil they use in their other pens but they've made it disposable 0.4 grams you say that sucks well as you know the oil from Rove is a lot thicker which means the battery needs to be a lot hotter for that oil to burn so instead of getting a half a gram or even a full gram in a disposable you get halfway through it the battery dies you're pissed off you're at a concert or you're somewhere where you're using your disposable and and it doesn't work so what they found is this is the best combination for the consumer so there you go hot off the press if your dispensary doesn't have it yet get on them find out when they're getting them and load up I'm sure they're going to come out with more flavors in the in the near future and I will let you know when that's happening but right now check it out disposables everybody loves the disposable so there you go hop on it let me know how you like them I've only had it for a day and and really loving it so hope you enjoy like subscribe share the video let people know that it's out there and we'll see you soon [Music]", "ECBnKrgfdPE": "hey y'all another sunny day in SoCal here to show you two Alpine they've been there $20 each here in Vista California and their 300 milligrams each so this one is a sativa and it tastes and smells like elbow rubble smells and tastes like bubble gum it's actually pretty good ever I tried it and it's disposable so when you're done it that you just throw the way this one doesn't have much left and but here goes cheers and see you on the other side it is it is a bit hard to get used to it first but as you can see I'm still getting used to it but um it's pretty good I'm on one hit and I'm already feeling it so and it smells and tastes like double bubble so you can smoke it you know in the house we would ever enough people people probably just say you're chewing bubble gum I don't know as long as all thumbs library long photos library with the little key I don't quote me on that though okay so that was that one that was good I'm sativa it's thirty two point nine seven percent THC 0.09 percent CBD 0.27% CBN and that brand is Alpine sativa disposable vapor came as pretty good for twenty bucks it's three hundred milligrams yeah it's not that bad I actually really liked it everyone that I've everyone that's tried it to that node is like it as well so and then this one is the their indica version and it the flavor is fruity pebbles so kind of taste like that fruity cereal I thought some people tell me that it tastes like lemon it does kind of taste a little bit lemony but I can definitely taste the three bubbles one has more in it meet cheers and see you on the other

better late than never but never late is better alright so back today I got another cartridge so I hadn't been uploaded I just been busy you know but I was excited about this one I don't know why I never tried this brand I tried a lot but anyway let's get straight into it today I we're gonna come up at you with evil lab colors tropical fruit it looks bomb it smells bomb I haven't tried it but I smelled like the cartridge tasted it a little bit let's get into the details shoot its flavored tropical fruit I don't know how flavors in the taste in it but I'm more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so that's always a good sign if your oils runny surprise stop smoking that [ __ ] man I don't know what the hell you smoking but here we go without further ado shoot it's my first time trying it I'm excited screw this bad boy off if it has a nice little I don't know I just think it's I don't know I really like presentation go there they got me they got like a good presentation and it makes you want to buy this stuff actually thought further ado cheers guys it just hits man kind of thing it does taste food fruit punch but you also get that cannabinoid flavor I got a hot flash well it's real good man like take one more hit I really like the start I think I want to try the other three cards they have the bail range and like prices from $20 for a half gram they got $30 half grams they all range from big prices but otherwise I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep poking you guys and do you guys want more reviews let me know and I'll keep I'll keep doing them yeah hi my friends", "Hy9-NrmlBvs": "you guys know your uncle Rick is just super in the flour that's kind of like my thing is what I do I'm not really into the vape I'm scared of it to be honest I think it's like a step away from a terminator or like a Robocop situation all right uncle Rick trying new things see Deb it takes hella think I mean it's a super day there's like I got vocal gold dankness uncle's across the board you were to say hey uncle what's your favorite kind of buddy Acapulco gold I smoked it once in Hawaii what's that back in the day this guy gave me a whole garbage bag full of Acapulco gold and all I had to do was help him burn a Chevy Corsica yeah total just tranquility peace prosperity so it concluded I just wanted to say uncle Rick approves yeah I got I smoked a lot of this thanks for coming out tonight drive over drive home it definitely tastes dank I don't know if I mentioned that earlier but dank tastes for sure certified dankness", "t21UF6fsJ2E": "what's up guys Katie with the grass skirt lounge so I have a new bait pen cartridge and I'm doing this with my brand new phone by the way this is another high fly vape pen cartridge this is grape ate another indica last time I had two bubblegum cush which was [ __ ] amazing by the way it was a spectacular man the flavor the smell and the potency was was top-notch one thing though the like for instance what I've noticed so far between the brass knuckle cartridges the bloom cartridges and the high fly cartridges while the the wick versus the coil system I prefer the how can I say this not prefer the coil system the coil system is um seems to I say give you a better took you you can get a better toke off the coil system versus the wick system the bloom cartridges are still good I mean they're [ __ ] great the indicas are top notch you know it's just the it's just that difference between the the coil and the wick where it seems a lot looser it seems easier to pull the with the coil system it seems you get a better vape it seems with the coil system it seems the stronger vapors you know I'm more lucid me but uh whatever I mean I like them both you know but I would have to say I prefer this apparatus over the coil system I mean the UM the wick system so anyway back to the great thing now the great babe is fire the only drawback I see so far to to the high fly joints is they go kind of quickly you know the the concentrate seems to be the concentrate seems to be I don't know what like kind of running almost not as thick as the bloom or the the brass knuckle cartridges are but other than that I be you get a nice toe this Grape Ape it's very potent you know it uh it definitely gets the gag reflex jumping off but so far like I said I haven't found any drawbacks to the arm that the debate cartridges produced by high fly they hit just as well as the brass knuckle cartridges so stay tuned for on the channel for for me and my experimentation with other brands and other cartridges as well because there are plenty of them out there I've only barely scratched the surface but so far the three that I've tried I like but I like to I prefer the coil system over the wick system and that's about it the grape eight high fly is good so far without from what I've seen the high fly cartridges have the same strains as the brass knuckles I'm the great babe the UH the dough see dose the only ones I believe brass knuckle didn't have that I didn't see was the bubblegum coach cush which again I highly recommend that gelato gelato is it's [ __ ] amazing and what's the other one King do we can't do it it's [ __ ] good to go seek dose that's one bubblegum could gelato dough see dose all of the ones that I've had are good but those three are like the potin right into Grape Ape is right up there with them so you get a chance to uh get a vape in check it out at your local dispensary or a vape shop smoke shop wherever you get them from and I'll be seeing you guys leave in peace", "87_JDlRVdc4": "so guys Katy with the grass skirt lounge so I just want to preface this video real quick by saying anything that I talked about any products that I talked about any cannabis products or anything that I talked about simply based on my experiences with those products I'm not telling anybody to or not to do anything spend or not spend anything smoke or not to smoke anything you know you can do whatever you want to do I give my opinion on the products and that's pretty much it you know to each his own now anyway it's half why babe culture this is ahead gram of bubblegum cush this is an indica and I got to tell you this is absolutely [ __ ] amazing it's really good the taste the smell it's sweet like bubblegum you know this is not for kids so it's not actual bubblegum but this is a really good this is a really good concentrate on the app that the actual uh cartridge itself is similar to the brass knuckle cartridge and of course you know is universal so it fits onto the brass knuckle battery and okay I found mine so I'm gonna go in and take a tote because it is absolutely a business it's this fire it's bomb it's the [ __ ] you know saying I like it you know and it's very strong this is a very strong concentrate as well let me see that this is a very strong concentrate and some of the effects that I have noticed from it I know this duck you can't see this boat anyway some of the effects that I have noticed rub it got in my munchies but it really gives you that really deep in the Kabaddi high that you look for in a really good end of girl she really does that and like I said you don't need a whole lot of talk to this of course depending on your tolerance level obviously but I don't need a whole lot of talks to this you know maybe one or two talks to this every couple of hours or so and be straight but that's all I wanted to introduce you guys to I know this format isn't my normal format I'm out on a crime right now I'm trying to get paid but you know because the grass skirt learns delivery service is coming and our cannabis menu will be in effect so stay tuned for everything and yeah there's more coming definitely trust me there's more coming but anyway if you guys get a chance to check out some high fly caught you just I say check them out if you know if you if you get a chance to if you want to if you want to spend the money on it but the bubblegum cush is good I like it and it's fire and I'm out peace", "PkQ-iT3mDjM": "hey what's up guys hopefully my cameras set up correctly so you guys can see everything all right but it's a boy everything tank here back in another video today I'm gonna be doing a dank vape review me being everything dang you know pretty good pretty good time so garlic's new battery my homie Frankie let me borrow it cuz my old brass knuckles battery starting to give up I don't actually know where it is uh right now I thought it was right right there but I guess it's not uh-huh so anyways I got this one there brass knuckles batteries super good I've had mine for literally like a year he's been waxed leaked into it they've been [ __ ] who knows what the [ __ ] has happened to that battery like it's still alive with me today so it's been good I highly recommend breast milk with batteries anyways they start off the slow review um I'm gonna just talk about the strain I got first off I got strawberry coffin here I've had one other dang fate before I got ak-47s waiver cuz it was really lemony and I don't know he's too much lemon too much lemon in a cart just tastes terrible but it gets you smacked the bank babes are really cheap and they do really hit the only thing you got to make sure about is if you're giving a real Bank babes and the only way you really know I guess is not even by the packaging like I don't even have the packaging with me anymore but on the bottom of the cartridge I don't know if you guys could see it should be a seashell cartridge at least I know that it's supposed to say a seashell and that's a higher chance of it being real and just looking at the wax if it looks really golden then there's a better chance that it's better than if it's a cartridge that looks brown just by looking at it and pretty sure most you guys know that cartridge is just the peel I guess it it is true like I've seen dang babes that look Brown and I've hit them and they're completely different than ones that look gold in there who knows who even makes these so that's the thing when you're buying them you just gotta know who you're buying them from and if it's gonna be good enough or not like they are cheap and you're gonna get you're not gonna get the best product possible you're getting like I got this for $25 it's a full gram that's that's cheap they will give me faded but I don't know the chemicals the pesticides in here and it's just all a risk if you want a cheap high then go ahead if you want something that you can trust then you're gonna have to pay more money but for what it is these aren't bad at all imma hit it now you see that [ __ ] hits fat one thing though the wax in mine is super thin do not like that usually a sign of bad quality but for some reason most wax that's super thin like that doesn't hit hard but d still still do very hit hard very very hard [ __ ] that [ __ ] smacks the Strawberry Cough and dang faves tastes kind of similar this dizzy Strawberry Cough just um leaves a little bit of a different aftertaste to it it's really hard to kind of when you initially like first hit it some carts will hit you right when you hit it the dank vapes kind of creeps up on you like right now I could just kind of feel it just the faded Nicias just creeping up on me it's weird it's a weird weird feeling but I could just feel it like coming to my like I don't know it's like I could feel like the blood rushing to my head shit's crazy you know but anyways like as I said I got this with $25 that's a full gram cart like and then it's max so I can't really complain I don't know what's in it though but there's so many companies that are charging you probably like VBS for example VBS started you $40 for a half game and they failed for pesticides so the [ __ ] like like it's just pointless to [ __ ] get some [ __ ] from there if they're failing for pesticides too and they're [ __ ] selling this [ __ ] for $40 and I'm getting this for 25 if fellas for pesticides but I don't know just I'm really conflicted to like I don't know whether I should be smoking this because it [ __ ] gives me faith as [ __ ] but there's probably held a chemicals in this [ __ ] but I don't know that's my honest review guys if you're looking for a cheap dank vape basically like it's just cheap but it'll get you fate of this book and it looks pretty dank then that's what you're looking for but if you're looking for something nicer check out some of our other reviews stiggy's definitely a lot nicer xxx dollar 1/2 gram pods though carvanha send is a really nice cartridge to but those go for $45 half grams though he's attested no no pesticides honey oil they have no pesticides Buddha bear brand they have no pesticides I'm gonna be doing a review on them soon I'm gonna get some product and hopefully soon so yup anyways peace out guys it's been everything day", "FBru-i5Xf5g": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well hello everybody welcome to a brand new podcast today again we got another cartridge of you but today we're gonna be doing something a little bit more different I've only tried this brand at least like once and it is the king pan brand honestly the reason why I really I wanted to make this I had to make this video like I have to make this video I have to show you guys exactly what I really think about these and the only issue that I have with these but other than that I think King pen is hella fire it's I guess it's one of the world's most awarded cannabis fate I mean I guess I could believe that because this [ __ ] is it's pretty far is it better than raw garden heavy hitters you know what it's on its own it's on its own level so today I got some Cali oh it's eighty-three percent THC checked it out and I got a Minuteman I mean the design of this is pretty sick you know I think it's pretty dope it's powered by loud pack if you got you guys to see that right there and it says right here a 1 3 second draw as I see while serving so like always everybody you know a 3 second drag that's gonna be equivalent to one hit and let's seize cartridges king pan cartridges are available in indica sativa and hybrid proud to be the most avoided cannabis bait in the world okay in the world but hey man you guys better be cool watch out cuz you know seven 10 laughs who knows how their cartridges are gonna be raw garden to a man everybody's trying to come on big fan of raw garden because everybody that I know that smokes cartridges and I'm talking about like you've wired from like different cities and stuff they're all going for those rock garden songs oh man you better watch out cuz you might not be the most awarded soon so bono so I've actually tried a couple of these before I do have another flavor King Louie Oh got some King Louie og but I wanted to save that for another video but shout out the packaging but let me just show you guys one thing because these are just again everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the sales of these products and I don't sell anything on this channel or I don't push anything it's just an educational review it's for cannabis patients 18 and up you know people that are just wanting to look for a review so let's go right here oh so got myself a little half not too bad not too bad I do want to take this sticker off Rennie let me say [ __ ] it maybe take it off there's a little sticker right here sometimes the sticker kind of kills the color it doesn't get you like that full color if that makes sense you know kick off that sticker there you go slowly nice and slowly BAM oh okay look at this this looks kind of fired I do like the logo right there you guys see right there okay you guys see the logo and it's just some clear wax - and this is clear - like the liquid inside is so clear look at that look at that let's do a little test there you go it's not moving at all we got some sativa on our end so you know I'm trying to wake up but like just one thing I can't everybody I've talked about this in different videos don't get me wrong man these King pens are fired I like them to me they're kind of like equivalent to like a heavy hitter so cheers everybody let's try it out whoo that flare mmm that [ __ ] is so fiery literally just tastes like gum kind of like an orange that's like an orange e flavor and you can just tell us a tivo right off the bat honestly sometimes a lot of people could smoke a sativa and they feel like they took like a shot of coffee you're like a little cup of coffee which is kind of crazy to me it's the other way around I feel like sometimes I could be slumped but smoking sativa it kind of does kind of wake me up like mentally it's like a it's like a mental wake-up type thing you know the physical wake up I feel like I'm a little [ __ ] little tired just cuz I smoked it you know but here like hey I'm show you guys king pan BAM eighty three point zero three percent THC so oh well like how these hey the design is pretty cool you know it's kind of heavy notes made I'd like a little likes a little type of metal but one thing I really do like about the kingpin is that some other flavors are just like lose it they got they got a good taste you guys like I I completely like I approve of the taste the taste is pretty nice hmm oh yeah let me tell you guys one thing though and I know I feel like a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to this but let me know in the comments down below but check this out so if you guys see the very end of this so yeah I see the bottom of it right there like this bottom right here I feel like some some of the liquid stays right here you know it's it gets stuck right here and I feel like you don't 100% complete like you don't want a hundred percent like all over the juice doesn't go inside the you know like the little coils inside if that makes sense you know there's always like a little bit left over that's just stuck in there and that happened to me like two times already I bought two cuz back then I used to like the king I used I select heavy hitters brass knuckles and King pens those were like my two daughters before I even knew about like raw garden and all these other cartridges it was always it was mainly brass knuckles I don't really like the brass knuckles and the heavy hitters see here and there I came across a king pin but actually I think yeah cuz my first cartridge ever was a a brass knuckle it was some sv og I remember that I was the SF vog and it was the full gram and I remember when I first bought it I first bought my first pan I was so excited I was like bruh I'm gonna get so late sigh my room while watch a movie watch a show I'm like ooh it's gonna be sick and that's exactly what I did you know I freaking got my home chart I mean I spent without any somewhat charge but I thought it was in charge so I kind of charged it up you know put it in and I was just like oh dude I'll if I can get it can I can remember to lose and it was in the next room it was the next the next door room I switched rooms in my apartment but back there I was inside yeah this is a tea but I feel like I'm kind of like can look creative you know get a little bit like let's [ __ ] get this bag baby let's look in yes but I remember that's - I freaked I think I watched the epic movie you guys remember that movie those like dumb parody movies the epic loot it was like scary movie epic movie disaster movie [ __ ] love these those lows those stupid parody movies I think they're so funny they're so interesting cuz I'm late half the time but in reality they're they're [ __ ] shitty movies but I always thought they're hella interesting the one that I really like oh my god you guys should go check that one it's called Stan Helsing it's a parody of Van Helsing but that [ __ ] is just ash it's just so funny honestly damn I feel like one thing about the King pens is I feel like the airflow is really nice like there's a way too much now way too much air flow but the air flow is just like on [ __ ] point what's my name before I do remember it was like I forgot what 2014 what was one out like I was first introduced to a couple pens no yet no 2013 Oh 13 or 14 yeah I think it was 13 or 14 one of those years but it wasn't like a it wasn't like a cartridge like a wax cartridge you know like like like distally you know it wasn't stuff like that it wasn't like live resin - it was more like a little globe it was like these little globes and inside was like a little like a tab it was pretty much like you're taking a DAB and there was like a little piece like a little coil in the middle there's like a globe and inside it was like a little coil and it was like heat up so you don't have to put your dab on that stuff you'd have to put your down on that and then you would hold it and I should the coil would heat up and then that's when you take it out that's what I remember the first pens that's that's that's what I'm I'm you know like what the hell is okay to smoke out of a pin likewise and after that that happened and I made like a year or two after that that's when all these like distillate that's when all you got all these like wax cartridges all these like random cartridges coming out and they were fired you know I I came across like for sure a lot of real ones but I'm not gonna lie I didn't come across maybe here and there - three of them that were for sure fake and that's cuz again I've talked about this I say this in every single cartridge video if you guys if you guys are buying those fake-ass $20 cards to stop buying that [ __ ] man don't just just cuz you're you okay right now you're in your head you're part like all 20 bucks bro [ __ ] that I'm not gonna go buy a $35 half gram or a 55 or $60 a full gram at the club and I could be buying a full almost a full gram on 20 bucks just like you guys man you guys are smoking those deadly pesticides you guys are smoking that fake [ __ ] I don't care if you're like local drug dealer or whatever selling guys now man this is some fire that's just the real [ __ ] nah man [ __ ] that if he's selling that [ __ ] I got 20 bucks unless you personally know the person and you know that he's making it and you know exactly what's going on that [ __ ] don't trust that [ __ ] bro cuz if you're paying 20 bucks even 20 bucks for a half gram bro I don't think so no but hey sometimes you guys could get I mean I mean I'm not gonna lie something you guys could probably get like a nice little there's probably people out there that get some nice little plugs or you guys you get some real [ __ ] for really low shout-out to you but majority of the people out there hell nah man you guys copy nothing [ __ ] just save your money and just go buy yourself a [ __ ] full gram of like a heavy hitter you know raw garden you know like cuz I know a lot of people that just mind some fake [ __ ] say it and say this real [ __ ] but I don't [ __ ] I don't think so I don't know I would I wouldn't risk it because at the end of the day she guys's body you're not gonna feel the damages that don't see your body right now but you're gonna feel it like maybe 20 30 years down the road when you're like and then you're 50 60 s you're gonna be like tan mask [ __ ] I smoked all that fake [ __ ] this [ __ ] sprocket effect is 2-1 like 50 60 who knows hopefully now but [ __ ] that's what we're doing that that's why I'm doing this review you guys so [ __ ] makes you guys drop alike man drop a comment what you guys have favorite flavor if you guys have tried kingpin and if you guys are new hit that subscribe button click that bell so you guys can notified every time we upload but sure y'all want to take a hit like what's up I bought a when I first found out that there was fake cartridges out on the street that's why I kind of like completely I'm like [ __ ] that dude I'm not I'm stopping I'm not gonna buy off the street I did a couple times here in they're not gonna lie but this was like maybe like three years ago yeah this happened like maybe three almost four years ago I bought a [ __ ] cartridge it was a brass knuckles cartridge and I bought it for 30 bucks at 30 for a $30 full gram and I'm like okay this guy that I knew at the time on this guy probably bottom and bulk got him super [ __ ] cheap he's just adding another extra five you know another 5 10 bucks to the price to each cartridge so that's that's cool you know he's making a profit I smoked like maybe like one third of it in like the bottom of this she started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] was it getting black I started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] dude this [ __ ] is not normal she's starting it I like what the hell's inside this cartridge so I showed one of my other friends but if you like it's obvious I doing this is fake bro you're smoking like fake wax fake this to it you know you're smoking fake distill fake to steal like he's like nah bro just don't [ __ ] away so what I did I was like [ __ ] the [ __ ] grabbed it screwed it off I just did that [ __ ] away and from there I was like dude I can be something you can't be something that fakes you do I did know some [ __ ] one girl though I'm not gonna lie like she [ __ ] oh my god I'm just disgusting but I mean she wasn't disgusting what I'm saying like just she just had no idea one time like [ __ ] I met some girl that had a cartridge that was so [ __ ] dark so cheap you can tell the plastic was so cheap like I asked her I was like what you are this [ __ ] I bought it for my friend house like let the [ __ ] how much like it's like 20 bucks and I was like bro what though it was so dark she was smoking like black tar [ __ ] wax or some [ __ ] ha and I was like dude throw this [ __ ] away and she's like nah and I was like okay cool you know I wanna I want to like taste I'm not gonna inhale this [ __ ] so I took it here oh hell no my mouth too blew it out as [ __ ] tastes like plastic oh she pointed and she part finished it knowing her knowing that chicks you pod killed that [ __ ] she got laid off her ass how [ __ ] all these deadly pesticides all these like chemicals and [ __ ] I have no idea but I don't know I just don't think it's worth it honestly I think it's just it's best just to go to the your local club you know like just go to the local dispensary these brands I know it might not be like 100 percent safe but they're free share you're way better than the [ __ ] that people caught cop off the streets and I talked about this in almost every single cartridge video because it's just so important to not be smoking these book these nasty like chemicals because it's not it might not affect you right now but it's gonna affect you down the road so [ __ ] a lot of people say they leave comments down below saying that I need to take I need to hold in my heads for holidays but your lungs instantly absorb all the THC one day when the smoke goes in your lungs it like instantly [ __ ] absorbs all the THC you know so it's not like you have to keep it in there for it till I grab the most tasty you know but oh that's why usually I hit it I hate it make sure it goes all in the lungs and I just blow it out right away so I'm like yeah I got all the teasing I needed I don't need to keep that smoking my lungs I'm already I should that's about to be wow I'm lit can't even talk

right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "FSI-zShYMk0": "hey guys Breanna here bringing you your first how-to video from a PC so we have had a lot of inquiries from you guys on how to initially set up your vape pen for the first time so today I'm gonna demonstrate that for you so when you get your delivery it'll come in a prescription bag that looks something like this and inside you should have a battery that'll come in a package like this and a cannabis cartridge of some sort which will be like this when you remove your battery from the packaging you will find two parts one will be this top part which is actually how you charge your battery and this bottom skinny part is going to be your actual vape battery so you'll go ahead and unscrew these two and your battery comes already with a fourth of charge so that way you can enjoy it immediately upon getting it at this point you should be ready to open up your cannabis cartridge and you will find it to look something like this every cannabis cartridge is going to have security coverings on it for safety reasons at this point you should have removed the safety covering on the bottom as well as your charger from the top and now we're ready to connect these you will just screw it in and you're probably curious how do you turn it on so there's this power button right here and it's important to remember that you will always click it five times when you want to turn it on or when you want to turn it off so 1 2 3 4 5 and when you see it light up like that you know you're ready to officially start vaping so you will put it up to your mouth and you will hold this button down wow you inhale and there you have it that's how you set up your vape pen for the first time so after you've been using your vape pen for a while you're gonna have to charge it and that's where this piece comes in handy you will go ahead and screw it in and then you can charge it by plugging it in to your average computer or into a cell phone block you might have lying around as always with any of your cannabis related questions it's as easy as a PC", "CIpdISQChhQ": "what's up everybody king bomb here today we are opening the white Sabbath I read I 22 red eyes lead fire I'm not sure

been waiting for all ready for this had to hammer you I got my life slight you you whatever suppose all right here we go what is this what is this you the BS is crashed you you you you yes that's too much light huh along you we I just blew my mind what [Music] you no more they are does not mean the less THC they have you my bad a little bit that's alright now the the more yellow they are just means the more light that they captured after they were in the curing process if I'm not mistaken you that's got to be a good shot right you ah what was off this whole damn time okay my bad all right so let's just put someone aboard smoke it this whole [ __ ] review has been so messed up that's cool I didn't know I could do all that with my camera you might want to try how does that actually make a difference interesting I didn't know I could do [Music] well there we go [Music] let's put it on [Music] [Music] I guess I should make my camera so short all right [Music] I've no idea what this is about to be like those are some pretty interesting shots I didn't realize I can do all that with such a crappy real camera yeah first of all there is enough light like yellow to the overall container like things but when I'm pulling these out they're like clear as [ __ ] we're about to have to do a close-up on those individual look at this you get this shot for you guys this is a fantasy effective [Music] now look at this [ __ ] rock into the bowl five it's like a damn diamond tell me that's not clear tell me that's not clear oh my god you that's holding on there that is insane that is insane

weeds oh my god this will have another one of these let's see what they're all like there's a little bit of some again things that like tears - they're all over oh my goodness dude I cannot believe what I'm looking at right now look once more yellow this one looks extremely yellow next to that one Wow but even by itself not next to this one it was cleared I think there's some Turks offs in here that's making it yellow the smell on it's amazing you I think this is her proximal cook [Music] they're just clear bristles the clear diamond just weird it's clear like I'm looking right at it it is completely clear to those people that once before clear huh but like that's like the sauce that was kind of in there that I could use while I was getting that and it's clear the small amount down there although he's not yelling stuff in the box [Music] figure out where all the yellows are looking at it individually and really clear are you gonna smoke that great question yeah Holley again if this is your first time checking out our channel out here to do all of our recordings why so this thing is butchered to high hell that is what's going on all right let's take this bowl and this

I'm not leaving in the end of the video [Music] anyways I dropped that diamond", "60H-rAHWXWA": "yo what is going on everybody welcome back to another video with your boy sebby g man ding literally before i turned on my camera i was sitting on my desk and i looked at the date and i was like yo literally the year is going to come to an end already bro and i feel like this year i i feel like i could speak for everybody but this year has been super super super crazy i feel like me personally i had a lot of ups i had a lot of downs but you guys know man this year 2020 was definitely a crazy turn for i feel like of the majority of us all right guys so without further ado guys we're hopping into today's topic which is i'm gonna be i'm going to be presenting to you what i believe to be the best cartridge battery out in 2020 okay so as a cartridge viewer you really do end up trying so many different products in terms of batteries and stuff like that and me personally in the year 2020 i feel like i've tried literally over 50 batteries and in my videos i don't choose to show every single one of those products i like to minimalize it and really show you guys the only ones that i feel are worth it so the one that i felt like was more worth it this year the one that really caught my attention the most that really saved me when it came to cartridges was this battery right here all right guys so this one right here is called the toki 510 thread cartridge battery and it's one of my favorite batteries man it has so many features from wireless charging all that good stuff but the main feature that i like the most is the fact that it saves your oil so much more than any other batteries guys just because of the fact that it has a five to six um second draw limit i believe and i don't know what they do in that drop but literally you still get those super fat milky clouds so you're really not missing out on anything right so i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit for you guys i got myself a little live resin cartridge sitting nice and pretty on here so without further ado cheers guys like i said you still get those super fat clouds that you need in order to get super super big this battery right here literally has saved me from having to buy so many cartridges guys like literally i did the math and let me show you guys for an example right so this one right here is the alpine live resin cartridge the last time that you guys saw this on a video was i believe two to three weeks ago maybe a little bit more and guys i've only been using it on this battery after that video so every single time that i take a hit it's off of this toki battery and i must say that after three to four weeks of having this cartridge look at the oil look at the oil literally one of the things that they pride themselves in is being able to conserve the consumer's oil and i think that's super amazing because they actually did it man they actually found a way to adjust the battery so it's not overheating your oil and it still gives you the perfect hit but with that being said man i think literally they probably saved me at least a couple hundred to a thousand dollars this year just off of their battery alone and the fact that i could literally just still be using these cartridges on the daily without having to waste them within a day or two using that on the blue setting now we're gonna go ahead and hit it on the purple setting me personally i feel like the purple setting on this battery is the best setting to get the perfect super nice milky clouds and it brings out the terpene profiles out the most because it's a higher voltage but for me i like the hotter hits that way i could get baked a little bit more easier alright so without a doubt cheers [Music] oh my gosh dude one of the best things this year has to be the fact that a lot of companies came out with live resin cartridges and i must say man live resin really is a game changer from going to disney to live resident is super super phenomenal man just because i feel like live resin has such a better taste than dislike does and aside from the battery itself guys they also provide you with literally just about everything that you can possibly need when having a cartridge session all right so first off i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys what the first products were when they launched the battery but they have the portable charger right here usually you could use this with your phone but i think the better way to use it is whenever your cartridge is dead on the go you can always keep this portable charger in your car and literally just use it and never have to worry about a dead battery again the next product is going to be something that literally no one no one has done and turkey was the first one in this game from what i've seen to be the first to introduce this right here this right here is a wireless portable charger all right guys so pretty much all you have to do with this is you just have to line it up with the toki symbol and then it's going to start charging for you which is phenomenal man because i don't know how many times i have i i personally hate having to plug in chargers sometimes i can't even find my charger so being able to just leave this as at your desk with the convenience of just boom plopping it on top and it instantly starts to charge that's super super super satisfying for me super minimalistic not having to carry around a charging cable with me everywhere i go and um yeah man i love this this probably has to be one of my favorite things that they've released all right guys and last up on the list guys we have the most newest addition to the toki family which is this bad boy right here this is the toki 510 wax cartridge and you're thinking like whoa they sell wax cartridges too yes they sell wax cartridges but it's not your normal wax cartridge this one right here is a super high grade material wax cartridge it doesn't have any distillate or wax already in it basically you attach it to your toki battery and then inside it has its own little coils right there i think i still have some wax in there from the last video i made on it has some coils right there on the bottom and literally you could just be taking dabs or you could be hitting your cartridge right guys so the fact that they came out with this attachment in the year 2020 was super super phenomenal man because i feel like the year 2020 was the year that a lot a lot a lot of tech for the cannabis community came out and i was super super happy to get my hands on this one right here because i feel like like i said this is the best battery of the year 2020. it saved so many cartridges for me they brought so much more diversity with these wax cartridges right here with the portable chargers definitely my favorite brand of the year 2020 all right guys so now that i told you my favorite battery of the year 2020 i want you guys to tell me what your favorite battery is right so i'm going to be replying to everybody down in the comments below guys if you enjoyed today's video do me one last favor smash the like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe button alright guys i'm going to take one more hit for you guys i hope you guys i'm not really too sure when this is going to be uploaded if it's going to be uploaded before new year's

frosty resinous buds it is popular on with growers and hash makers like bubblegum has a sour smell and flavor and with the THC content and the 18% rage obviously they're talking about the bud this

hurt kind of a sizzle and like sometimes I I feel like that sizzle normally when you hear sizzling like on carts that beans are gonna like it's not gonna burn as slow is when you don't hear it I think so but then again that just might be me and then my own paranoia just kind of like wanting to find fault in like this great product because for the price and then the weight hits and the vapor production and the quality of the head it's a [ __ ] steal I would say taste wise I would give it a 9.2 Hitwise I would give it a this one I would you like an eight point eight point eight eight eight

as I enjoy you you guys have a good one", "C1ocH2KMqfY": "hey everyone this is concen and today we're going to talk about a question that we get quite a bit here at vaporizer review and that is how do I clean my pen vape and there's quite a few pen vaporizers out there but we're going to stick with the three general styles we have a dry herb we have a waxy concentrate and then we have an e juice style pen vaporizer here so we're going to go over how to best clean and maintain these vaporizers we're going to start off with the dry herb style I happen to have an at most Rx here I personally not a huge fan of drier pen style vaporizers they generally don't work too great often burn a lot so what we have here is a nameless rx with a glass screen down in there covering the herbs so we're gonna take a cleaning brush I find works best for the dry herb units and just kind of go down into the chamber and do the best that you can just simply take and clean the herb right back I they're just tapping it out onto a table into an ashtray whatever you have to just kind of get the herb out of the unit and with these pen units because they have the screep of the spring that pushes down on there it can be packed a little tight in there and when it all falls out if your pen unit happens to have one of the little glass screens in it I just take that and I put it into a little bit of isopropyl alcohol just a little bit of rubbing alcohol that I have here it's glass you can drop it in there and let it soak for a little while and while that's going on I like to just continue brushing any of the loose herb out of the drier chamber what you want to be weary of with these is there's a little coil right down inside if you accidentally snag and pull on that coil becomes loose in any way you're going to end up damaging the chamber and then this thing just ain't going to work right so you want to avoid pulling on the coil down in there just gently brush mostly aim for cleaning out the sides of the sir chamber there and when that's cleaned out some people like to take just a little bit of isopropyl and q-tip very small amount because you don't want to damage it holding it upside down take it and run it along the inside around the threading area this will keep it clean and maintain it without damaging the coil in any way and that's how we suggest cleaning up the dryer type of a pen style vaporizer very simple easy to maintain you know not the best it might end up burning but that's how we would handle the dryer now we're going to take a look at the wack style vaporizer and right here I have a micro vape nano unit very discreet very portable designed for use with waxy concentrates to go ahead and clean this one basically what we're aiming to clean here is the threading on it I like the pen style vaporizers for wax that are like a threaded connection and screw on as opposed to the ellipse style that pop off I think those atomizers they come free in your pocket easily I like when it's threaded on you know you have a secure connection to both the chamber and the battery will stay together well but one of the things you face when using that is you get some pretty gunked-up threading and when it comes to cleaning a wack style vaporizer you're not really looking to clean the coil you don't want to damage that because it's no longer going to heat up the whole idea what this really is to take in a q-tip with a little bit of the isopropyl alcohol and this is more about cleaning the threading on the wax tile vaporizer cleaning the threading is going to help keep it operating smoothly because you're going to be able to easily disconnect and then reconnect the top of the chamber to where the wax goes and with these style of cartridges where they thread off right where the wax goes it can be kind of a hassle if it's stuck together you're trying to open it so frequent cleaning of the threading on the wax tile vaporizers is really all you need that's kind of the whole goal you don't want to damage the coil in any way shape or form if you damage the coil it's just not going to heat up any more so when using your tool to load the wax onto there it's my suggest and all of our suggestions here at vaporizer review that you don't scrape it across there if you end up scraping it there's a very good chance you're going to damage it so that's something you're looking to avoid when it comes to loading just try and gently get it onto there do not be scraping across the coil and when it comes to cleaning all you're aiming for is the threading just want to get all the wax off the threading so you can unthread it and rethread it very easily we're going to take a look at now would be the less the pen style units we have here and this is the one mostly for like a juice I personally don't vape a lot of ejuice myself but I like a buck-naked style when it comes to these more often than not you're just going to change out the heating cartridge here the oil tank after a few uses if you're using different flavors it's not going to be that great but if you only have one tank handy and you do want to clean it out what I suggest doing is getting another one of the oil loaders and just fill it with some warm water the style I hear has a little bit of a wick so it's going to possibly retain some of the flavor but if you take a little bit of warm water and just kind of flush it through out there that's going to help clean it up a little bit and remove some of the flavor from it without having to buy a new tank every time you want to change the flavors that you're using in there a little warm water is all it takes you don't need to really soak it too much you want to avoid getting it down the hole in the middle as well as otherwise it might leak through there so avoid getting it down the hole in the middle otherwise there's might leak through on you and that's really all you need when it comes to the pen style close it up with that on there like this with a little bit of warm water in there keep it read and just give it a little bit of a shake this will help loosen up any of the e-juice that's in there and remove some of the flavor from it and that's all you really need to do when it comes to the EG style so that's our suggestions when it comes to cleaning pen style vaporizers if you have any further questions or just want to leave any comments go ahead and leave them down at the bottom of the video and we're here to assist you alright guys Cheers", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "k9_z857qA48": "hiya Mandarin Regas here from chronically baked goods we're a small at-home medical marijuana company we make concentrates wax shatters butters cooking oils all kinds of things we believe in eat to treat but we also smoke and we vape it's a lot easier to vape in public and we use pens smokeable pens in order to do this we have to outsource to a company called connoisseur concentrates they make terpenes of all types of flavors this is one of their pens this one is disposable they have rechargeable 5-10 pens with tanks and we use our product and their Turpin's and we make a total line of to go flavours right now for ourselves but we're trying to expand a little this one here is bubblegum [Music] it's quick just like smoking it's faster than waiting for an edible to kick in or a daily capsule to kick in it's really nice around the go it doesn't stink up your car the terpenes come in little vials like this this flavors skittles honestly it's the first time we've had it I can't wait to try it my favorite flavor is strawberry that's because I love strawberry everything I think it's better than the grape sometimes I think grape is too sweet the bubblegum is fun it's really sweet but when you use these concentrates which are or these terpenes I'm sorry when you use these terpenes super simple super simple you use their terpenes you put a little bit of your concentrate in there shatter crumble butter and you dissolve it in there with a little bit of heat you shake it up make sure it's all mixed up and then you get the eyedropper and you just put it in the pen it's super simple now they have little tanks I use a lot I upgrade it I twisted me some coils put it on my mod with my tank and it's super simple on the go I can use it anywhere it's discreet it tastes great and it's it works I love it [Music] it looks like you're vaping and it's really helpful for a society that is teeter-tottering with the acceptance of medical marijuana and recreational marijuana so as a small business owner you can't do everything yourself sometimes you have to outsource and we like to outsource this is counter-story concentrates otherwise known as the solution I suggest you check it out they have all kinds of flavors strawberry bubblegum grape tangerine banana pineapple then they also have some of your favorites tray flavors cheese gorilla glue I think it's called grills for some of that fruity pebbles skittles so if vaping is something you enjoy if medical in your state or recreational and you enjoy we strongly suggest the countess water concentrates terpenes try strawberry", "pQIp6xChq0U": "I so basically how you want to start is with wires just like this just from a USB cord just like that and you just cut the charging part off and then you'll have this right here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and over and it's infinite all right let me know if you want to see another video like this guys I could teach you how to make your homemade bait battery an entire battery that you could take on the go portable let me know if you want me to tell you how to do that let's go for a hundred likes and I'll do that are you", "rBBENjccIZQ": "[Music] during a vape cartridge review from poke gulch here in San Francisco since four level high classics [Music] [Music] okay then I got it on the pen a bit of a cold here comes with a little button I can't even see the camera some kind of paperwork Oh button it tested this vape cartridge on those are stickers too so [Music] well this [ __ ] [Music] where baby pigeons - supposed to be eighty eighty percent content THC I don't have to say the first head good flavor you know feel something here [Music] yeah mmm I'd have to rate this ten stars out of 10 stars well II why don't we do and one number three this is the best it's cost $35 [Music] I like that it was in sealed packaging [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] so now that I'm medicated I'm going to go to swans oyster Depot eat some oysters", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out

and the flight [ __ ] quit halfway oh thing just give up I'm not really upset about that I'm gonna call them and see if they can return it so anyways back to it this is a quick peek sovereign so when we went there I had 40 bucks and I was like okay I'm gonna go look this 40 longshadow and I looked at it and I was just like 5 and I don't know I'm not gonna spy nothing right and then look at sovereigns come over and I looked on those packs in there so what's in the pack she's like Oh sovereign shatter fits of I gave it to I think I said I have 40 bucks there's like one born in a flight and some weed stuff about lying to his for you give me the [ __ ] shatter this satin this so he did so anyways I ended up with $55 grand bomb shatter it was a toss-up between bubblegum cookies like what is it gross total cookies or granddaddy perks granddaddy perch hands down or the Bubblegum cookies yeah they're probably good but [Music]", "5oI_UgfSb-Y": "these are our splitting cartridges they go in indica hybrid and sativa in both half and full grams they make a very high-quality cartridge with very good oil inside there are over seventy percent THC and they're always in stock here at Vista Wellness Center the four grams go for 70 the half grand scope for 40 thank you", "83RDjixcrHo": "Oh PowerBait cart review so old pal vapes retail from around 15 to 20 dollars plus tax in Northern California they're also a Californian brand they come in blend in the strained version but we got the blend person as you can see it's very child resistant it also has the California symbol on it it doesn't say that it's easy so but the packaging is very sturdy and it's also made out of plastic and stainless steel it pairs with and you five-10 threaded battery and it's very easy to use it's really good on a number of - setting the oil is white amber the flavor is very mild and it hits very well as you can see overall it gets you high into hits that's a very good smoking experience in my opinion", "j-bUETXS7Eo": "these would be our alpine vapor cartridges they have 900 milligrams of their co2 oil these are refillable you would open them up on the bottom and these go for $40 here

THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "4T3xo27vhNk": "if you're not a canvas patient or of age please cycle for this video yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be smoking on some maddie labs cart

plug play cards i want to show you guys right now look at i'm in my house and i could have ordered a thousand fake plug play cards just like that here's your phone back thank you so much yeah that never calls you back block it this is what's going on today while i'm doing this right now peter's on his way over here with the plug play team he's at a trap spot buying fake plug play cards yes the guy that you see does plug play is going investigator 2 to go buy fake ones he's gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it brown and yellow you see it there's yellow chunks in here why oh it's dead leaves oh it's trim oh this is true so guys this past month has been pretty wild we did exposing fake cards which led us to this because you guys asked so much how to spot fake cards how do you know if your cards fake how to spot fake packaging i'm so sorry i got you so high man but that's just that's what happens sometimes over here peter thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to first off go to the trap spot and get all these fake ones and then bring some real ones just to show us it was super informational dude even like i said even i got played i had no idea how to spot these because they look so [ __ ] real this has been how to spot fake carts with plug play thank you so much guys for watching pass this information along thank you guys so much for watching i'm dobaziola have a dope ass day oh [ __ ] damn i", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "DA8SkNMyctM": "hello how are you it's me Maria I'm just chilling here in my Bay Penn brass knuckles and getting ready to walk to the liquor store so I can get some money

on periscope of maria ryan on periscope and i'll see you guys in the next video peace", "rNE8BbB9rKU": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what's up y'all the sky high on georgia pie car just came in and here's my first impressions the smell is weird you know not weird in a like you know bad way but like i didn't expect it to smell so vibrant [Music] like it smells like a candy guys like it smells like a real sweet kind of peachy kind of candy cheers no way that tasted so much better than roper for labs hold on guys [Music] wow guys this is so much better than the rogue river carts but this georgia pie cart is amazing man what's up guys boy p2 peeps today we're going to be checking out sky hiyo's georgia pie delta 8 thc cart with the cannabis derived terpenes here's the cart itself you know not the packaging or anything like that we do have point three percent of delta nine and thc contained in this i will be putting the uh percentage of delta eight thc on the screen on the screen sorry uh but yeah let's go ahead and take a hit and uh let's talk about it guys i know you guys might have seen the first impression a little clip i had so you guys already know i'm a big fan of this flavor cheers y'all thank you for joining me on yet another video review cheers [Music] you know we got to do a blinker for the first hit that's customary so yeah delta a is kind of more known as the more harsh cannabinoid comparatively to cbd and delta 9. but this is pretty smooth and i'd say it's still much smoother than the rogue river labs car i take a blinker from a rogue river labs cart and i am dead the flavor here is great i think they got a good mix of terpenes in here now i'm not sure um if all the delta eight thc cards from sky high are gonna taste the same i'm going to assume as of this point in time no but that is you know a common theme with some brands guys you know raw garden sublime smokeland certain delta eight brands they they all kind of sometimes use a similar tert blend so that kind of makes all their strains kind of taste the same to me this doesn't i don't think it is like that but yeah going on to the taste it's very very sweet kind of almost like a peach sweet you know like a picnic when you have a cup of peaches in syrup you know like the you know the to-go things uh to go fruit bowl things that you can get in a snack container or a lunchables or something so i'm kind of getting that level of sweetness from this not too much else maybe a little bit of pineness but that's about it there the potency on this thing is pretty nice just you know going off my previous experience of having some of it yesterday and a little bit of it today you know i i like the hot we're getting a nice head high there which kind of normally goes standard i think for delta 8 thc it normally starts with a little head high that kind of pulls you back in a sense like it feels like the back your head is is is is going backwards in a sense like you know like i said like look a little pullback i couldn't find any straight uh strain info you know about the cross of georgia pie but the strain itself is a seed junkie genetics cross so you know if you guys know seed junkie genetics that guy's making some of the best fire around you know the homie freddy has some of his genetics as well that is you know growing up so this is really good stuff um strain wise strain why so i'm probably going to go ahead and look into uh seed junkie and see if i could figure out the georgia pi uh cross yeah i'm enjoying the dirt profile on this you know like i said really peachy kind of flavor almost like that syrupy kind of pizza a little fruit bowl thing so i'm going to take another hit here see if we can get this high a lot more potent see what else i might be feeling off this thing cheers y'all [Music] i gotta say guys this is really one of the most impressive d8 cards i've had honest i am super impressed with this thing like the flavor is done very well nice and smooth and it's almost to the point where um you know if it weren't for the color i would barely able be able to tell that the difference between this and a delta nine thc car you know potency wise of course you can always tell the difference you know but if you're someone who doesn't smoke that much this is going to be great for you honestly like if if you can't handle any delta 9 thca all that stuff delta 8 and cbd is most likely going to be the route for you and if you want the closest thing to that psychoactive high of delta nine go ahead i definitely recommend delta eight let's take one more hit here guys uh but potency wise pretty good setting in a little bit more um the head high is not getting as intense as i thought it would um after hitting it again it's actually kind of not flowing a little bit more downwards um i'm feeling my back is feeling actually really good now now that i think about it um not now i was gonna say this i'm gonna preface this was saying this this is it's not stronger than delta nine to me to me you know if i took a dab of uh let's let's say these bear labs guava fake diamonds right if i took a dab of this is it's completely gonna overwrite whatever this is you know if i take a blinker of my sublime ceramic cart you know this this is probably gonna overwrite this you know i'm gonna take two blinkers of this this is gonna get me probably a little bit more higher than this will but that's okay guys you know this is not supposed to be beating delta nine you know it's supposed to be an alternative to that so let's take another hit yo but yeah this is uh one of the best ones i've had so far i can't wait to try the other uh sky hill carts i have here you know we got cereal milk and white runs to go so very very very excited for those strains and you know these strains aside from the georgia pie actually are strains i've had in real life so i could probably make a better uh distinction between them or something hopefully hopefully thank you guys for watching up to this point you know and if you have not drop a like for the homie drop a little comment let me know what you are smoking on and which of these three strains sounds more appealing to you man the georgia pie the cereal milk the white ones man which one would you get and if you have been enjoying and not been subscribed please hit that subscribe button it's for the free skis man and the nerdy bill is too so you know you hit both of those you're going to know when i'm i upload when i live stream all that stuff you know i want to have a more ironed out concrete schedule again i mean i feel like a lot of people just kind of forget the schedule sometimes so i'll probably talk about it a lot more and try to make a more considerate effort to push it out there cheers everybody thanks for coming through with them good vibes as always [Music] so [Music] three blinkers in like less than five minutes that's about less than ten minutes is that definitely gonna hit you but that's about it for this review guys taste wise right this is completely peachy you know i'm not really getting much of anything else just a really nice deep sweetness the terps here are fantastic man great job to sky ohio you know really good mix of terp and oil and potency-wise not too bad at all for a delta eight cartridge i honestly think that this is gonna be one of my favorites so far especially because of the flavor um but yeah if you guys are wondering how it stacks up to the ruger for labs potency-wise i do think that the wedding cake and black lime were just a tad bit stronger than this but we'll see how that cereal milk and white runs do and all that but so far very very satisfied with sky ohio and another thing guys is you should try to order all your delta eight before the march 27th ban um uh they're going to be banning delta eight being shipped in you know in packages through the usps and all that stuff um pretty soon the usps is though kind of reconsidering it so if you guys do want to buy delta 8 for the future or do want to help the people who are trying to keep this thing legal in you know the mail then please go google that the usps is uh like i think i think there's a form or an org you can join i i believe but yeah just go ahead and google that up and you know fight the good fight if that's what you want to do but thank you guys for tuning in and watching i hope you guys come back for another video or a live stream or something like that i do enjoy it when i see all these familiar faces and new faces in the streams and comment sections and all that so thank you guys for joining me take one last little puff here yeah go with good vibes everybody and have a great day night afternoon whatever time it may be yeah pizza out peace you", "qnJnuDTWlms": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day", "qC9kjfAu2MU": "hey guys it's Nick with blue farms here just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "cTfwKtN-2is": "[Music] you ready yep what's up green fans welcome back um we just wanted to make this little short video today for you guys we

smoke man last night I did end up copying one of my favorite cars hold up I not probably showed it already but I I've copped one of my favorite cartridges of all time right or what used to be my favorite cartridge of all time I it's been a while since I smoked it so I said why not cop it again and let's go ahead and smoke it on for the boys one time and see if I still like it man see if it's still there see if they still got it so if you guys know me you guys know my love for this part right here boys raw garden yes sir one of my favorite cartridges of all time if not my favorite cartridge of all time and you guys know I've I think raw garden has to be one of the one of the brands that I've done several several videos on like I'm talking about probably for the first half of my youtube career I did nothing but carb like cartridges on raw Gardens sauces and things like that man it was [ __ ] phenomenal so hold on I don't even tell you guys what we were smoking on so right here they feel if that book hopefully that's focused in but we got some gorilla gas berry and this is an indica sitting at 84 point 86 THC men and to pair that up though we got that Relaxo m9 battery right here that's this divot this giveaway for this battery is actually still going on it was gonna be a full month's worth of them it was gonna be a full um a full month that I was gonna be doing it

below man and be subscribed to my page so yeah cheers guys get it crack this sucker open you guys know what a raw garden looks like right you got the little yellowish tint little clearish go ahead and smack this on here oh quick one time and man what saddens me is that I cannot find my green ooze battery I don't know if you guys remember my green ooze battery that um that was the my daily driver for a while yeah that was my daily driver for a while I mean I am ended up finding up about this battery and this battery honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with the raw garden videos baby cheers guys I think that might have been a little bit too hot yeah the wrong guy always makes me called you off of that little hit I'm telling you this battery dude the water use on this patty are insane it makes that makes your hits and extremely freakin huge so we're gonna go in on a green I think Green is lowest setting for this so cheers goes whoo oh my goodness that was the perfect hit yo Wow Wow Oh holy [ __ ] you're on e open on my window or something's kind of I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty [ __ ] hot in here so hold on this way for the beep Ian stop all right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried definitely it has a little bit more of a yellowish tint to it also and man it is this is an indica dominant I definitely feel the indica hitting me I'm lumped right now like I said my eyes are actually turning a little bit red so that's actually quite crazy I need a damn very good and then um yeah but like the Tate like I said the taste is phenomenal like every other raw garden that I've ever tried nothing too special but at the same time you know it's better than most of the cartridges that I've tried so raw garden you get you get you get another 8 out of 10 from you man you guys need to make something that's I don't know man you guys need to do something you guys need to do something different for the community I feel like you guys have done a weed thank you for everything that you've done that Bo we kind of want something different man at least from from me man I want something different from you guys so yeah guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully we at least reach to 10 minutes so you guys can have a good video to watch man let me know in the comments below what you guys what is your guys's experience with raw garden you know what do you guys like about it what don't you like about it what are your what are your favorite strains above them you know because I know they have some of this like I said they were they have some of the same strains that they cross with multiple times so let me know what you guys is favored right now in them in March 2020 man let me know which one's the best one you saw I think that's for me the best one that I have ever smoked from them I think was a the summer Bubba I think this summer Bubba for me was freaking phenomenal or that one or the LG Chem one of those two so yeah like I said I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it man hopefully you guys have a positive blessed day after seeing this video man stay motivated like always and we'll catch you guys in the next word", "MljAks08IKk": "so today i'm going to be doing two it's really one review of one product but two separate strains of the product it is going to be quality control thc and these are drops they're tinctures it says on here terps i don't know why they're calling them terps [Music] but this one is i got maui wowie and i have golden pineapple now the golden pineapple is a hybrid the maui is a sativa and the maui wowie i prefer the maui over the golden pineapple this is something the maui the sativa is something you're going to want to take during pretty much during the day later on in the evening and this is something that you probably would take later in the evening closer to not i'm not really a fan of i'm not a fan of anticas or indica dominant strains i like the uplifting and relaxing feeling not the stoned out of your mind feeling um this the maui is amazing i was taking these i got to get another bottle i ran out of the maui but i was taking one about a little drop i'll show you how much you should take you want to take it about i took it sorry taking about an hour after i woke up and then after that son of a [ __ ] it shows you the recommended dose on here i can't even get this [ __ ] open with one hand the recommended dose is like a fourth of the dropper that's pretty much what i stuck with it takes about 30 minutes to kick in and with the maui you will notice a calming uplifting feeling now the golden pineapple i think it's more of a anthic dominant it feels that way anyway so you take it and about again about 30 minutes you feel it but it it it's more of a couch like type of feeling for me and i do not like that they have grape ape i was gonna get grape eight but it's a pure indica and i can't i'm not even gonna [ __ ] with it but 100 would highly recommend this because i'm going to tell you some of the the great benefits of it for me is i noticed that people that normally got on my nerves didn't get on my nerves as much whenever i was whenever i had that in my system so i was able to be around people where i was not in my head as much meaning i wasn't like over analyzing every little thing that was happening or that did happen or that could happen and i was just able to i guess step back and enjoy things more now uh another pleasant side effect of this is it does not this is going to sound odd to say but it it kind of it kind of decreases your appetite i have noticed like it doesn't give you much use it doesn't it even makes you not spill hungry and another bro amazing side effect for me for me was it i'll take kratom i have kratom reviews coming up and i was taking too much credit my thought i still think i was because i was taking like an ounce to an ounce and a half a day and now once i started taking this i was able to get a three ounce bag to last me like five six days so we cut my kratom usage in half so i'm definitely going to pick up the um i'm definitely going to grab more of the maui wowie definitely going to grab more than maui now the golden pineapple i still have [ __ ] i still have about three fourths of a bottle left with this so i am going to use that before i get more maui and i do want to say these retailed for 29.99 30 even at my local dispensary or botanical shop i have noticed uh with a lot of these products that you can order them offline for cheaper as opposed to going into your local dispensary or botanical shop the only issue with that is by the time you wait for it and you cover shipping you're paying about the same price unless you get a large quantity so just ordering one of these offline if you don't have them in your area go ahead and order them offline because you'll pay the same price as you if you walked into your local dispensary slash botanical shop but if you get a high quality of things definitely definitely order online or look around your area to try to find better deals because uh i have something that i'm going to going to get today that i'm going to review and talk about how i ended up switching dispensaries botanical shops then i had to drive an extra 20 minutes but the price the quality the uh just the friendliness i guess you could say of this place drew me there i still [ __ ] with a shout out to advanced botanicals still [ __ ] with those guys uh but this new shot man uh hook i mean they hook you up they're super chill super nice they give you samples they uh will mix [ __ ] up for you they will make i mean it's just amazing so today i'm going to get a kilo of white elephant white endo and white hulu mixed and then i'm getting some delta 10 thc which i'm going to review on here probably in the upcoming days i'm planning on getting the delta 10 cart and then i'm getting the cookies cart delta 8 cart it's it's a knockoff cookies it looks slack to me it's called cake i think or something like that i have to do a little bit more research on that but i've tried it from a friend and it was amazing so my my last um final say on this is it is wonderful definitely get it definitely check it out it's kind of like for micro dosing something to help you micro dose so you're not taking huge uh so let's just say you've got an edible and you want a micro dose and edible it's hard to it's hard to get an exact dosage unless you get ones that are you know like 25 or 15 milligrams per cube or per gummy and even then um you might take it and wait 45 minutes and not feel anything then you take a half of one and then they kick in together and you're you're you're you're done for the day or maybe the next two days edibles are hard to micro dose these are extremely easy to micro dose so if you're interested in micro dosing check them out it will give you a calm but uplifted relaxed feeling um that's all i'm going to say about it highly recommend we're going to do five stars here what i think of it and i'm gonna rate this a solid four stars this product quality control carts delta eight thc so definitely go check them out it is worth it and also guys i i'm extremely excited about this because you i have a ridiculous amount of delta 8 delta 9 soon to be delta 10 products i have a ridiculous amount of like cart of um pan reviews of box reviews of kratom reviews different kinds of kratom so please stay tuned i have psychedelic videos coming soon back and i'm also going to continue to talk about the reality as it is so hope you guys stay tuned for all that it's game of form in the play of life i am you talking to you love you guys", "627VyVGmXis": "hello one and all um welcome to this presentation that i'm doing on behalf of acm global laboratories i'm mira doig from um abs laboratories and i'm the by analytical technical director right today i'm actually going to cover some of the areas that i think are very important and that is the risks of the lack of regulation of using cannabidiol in vaping devices and how we at acm global laboratories can help you increase the information you have about these products both in efficacy and safety of this route of administration i will then overview the experience we have quantifying a range of cannabinoids in biological fluids and finally i will tell you about acm capabilities of supporting any clinical trial worldwide and they have been doing this since 1975. right to go into my hobby horse cannabidiol and vaping and the reason for my hobby horse is because we have supported a lot of work on nicotine and e-cigarettes and e-cigarette devices as we all know there are many historical reports indicating that cannabis based extracts containing a whole host of cannabinoids inc including cbd have therapeutic properties but to date the only registered medicine is epidialx now epidiolex is an oral solution for severe epilepsy in children and unfortunately the bioavailability of cbd via this oral route is only about six percent over the years recreational use has indicated that cbd is safe and likely to have many therapeutic uses and we also know the pharmacological effects of the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis base extracts tetrahydrocannabinol or thc is also highly bioavailable when smoking and it increases the bioavailability of cannabinoids at least to 30 percent unfortunately to date there's no records or reports in the literature of any bioavailability or clinical studies using vaping devices but there is a whole host of cbd e-liquids commercially available worldwide and also people are using any sort of vaping device to administer these cbd liquids and these are normally developed for nicotine administration rather than cbd so as i've just said there is a whole host of commercial interest in preparing cbd vaping fluids but there's very little or no regulations covering the production of these fluids what solvents you're allowed to add to these fluids or their associated develop delivery devices in contrast the food standards agency has just given cbd companies a deadline of the end of march to have a validated novel food applications submitted for each of their products if they've added cbd to foods or drinks after this date only products that have been thoroughly tested and applied for this application will be allowed to remain on the market and i'm sure very soon that um vaping fluids will have similar sort of regulations now why is this well basically cannabidiol is very unstable and is prone to oxidation even in alcoholic solutions the red molecules on the structure associated on this slide is hydroxyl groups and these are where they're oxidated both for light and temperature sensitivity and in some solutions especially if there's any aqueous present cbd can break down to a myriad of compounds in a matter of days and also what's the stability like when you've added all these additives that people are adding to these e fluids such as vitamin e acetate and various flavors etc one group in italy looked at the cbd content in 13 commercially available e-liquids what they did was they examined how the content matched the label and also they did an experiment of the stability of cbd in the solvent the main solvent they said of all these products was propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin but unfortunately they didn't mention in this publication what other additives were added to these e-fluids the cbd concentration in the individual fluids ranged from 10 to 100 milligram per ml and here are some of the results where they assayed the cbd content in these 13 e fluids unfortunately five of the samples were underestimated for their cbd content and it ranged from 11 to 92 percent five of the samples were within plus or minus ten percent and another three were overestimated for the cbd content by 13 to 17 now at the moment what you should have in labels is that the concentration matches the actual content of the material within plus or minus two percent so basically 30 all 13 products did not meet these regulatory guidelines then they conducted their stability experiment looking at stability either refrigerated room temperature or at 37 degrees and you can see the data on this slide that really refrigerated storage was the best way of storing these e-fluids as the cbd content within a month only decreased by about five percent whereas the decrease of cbd content increased with increasing temperature in addition light instability was demonstrated yet on any of these e-fluids there was no recommendation on the label to store refrigerated or in the dark they were even given expiry dates of 12 months but goodness knows what the content of cbd or the other materials in these e-fluids was like at the end of that 12 months i'm sure there was no formal stability data done on that and the vials that some of these are prepared in not only are they clear glass rather than brown glass they don't recommend storing in the dark so as i've mentioned before there really is a whole host of lack of regulation of these fluids even though they're commercially available there's also a lack of control of the vaping devices to deliver these fluids and how this affects the health of the users there's no published data on the bioavailability of cbd with differing vaping temperatures or devices people just seem to be using nicotine vaping devices and i know our experience with measuring the bioavailability of nicotine that it can be affected with various designs of vaping temperatures and devices no one's actually demonstrated medical efficacy using vaping devices either and none of the devices are registered as a medical device to deliver cbd increasingly over the last year there have been lots of deaths registered and lung damage in people vaping with cannabinoids and this appears to be far higher than any of the nicotine e-liquids so again this is all evidence that we must start to regulate cbd vaping fluids now how can partnering with acm help you with getting a strategic advantage of getting some data on the bioavailability and safety of your vaping solutions or developing a vaping delight device specifically for cbd first of all we can support your bioavailability studies so that you can generate a device that is designed to efficiently develop deliver cbd and then after you've done that you can conduct clinical studies to obtain both safety and efficacy data for cbd or any of the other cannabinoids as well so this is what we call adding value to your cannabinoid containing product abs is the division of acm global laboratories and we have experience assaying a variety of cannabinoids such as cbd cbdv and thcv now the structure on this side is actually of thc and thcv is actually the c3 hydrocarbon rather than the c5 hydrocarbon shown on this structure we also have an off the shelf say to our say cbd thc and 11 hydroxy thc in plasma to support regulatory pre-clinical and clinical studies and we have the experience of supporting various cutting-edge therapeutics such as sativets through the whole r d process other areas that we have supported in the past and can support in the future is looking at cannabinoids in food drinks cosmetics and other topical products as i've mentioned before we have this off the shelf assay for cbd thc and the pharmacologically active metabolite of thc 11 hydroxy thc initially the assay was using gas chromatography mass spectrometry but as the technology advanced we have now transferred this assay to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using the latest mass spectrometer from a b science we have a method that's validated from 50 picograms to 100 nanogram per mil now many people ask me well what does that mean in real situation and why do you need this high the sophisticated equipment to measure these levels well basically one nanogram per ml is equivalent to two bottles of wine in all the world's oceans which is why it's really looking for a needle in a haystack when you're quantifying these low levels in biological fluids hence you need this technology and sophisticated mothers methods to actually measure these compounds we've also got stability so we can advise you on how to collect the samples store the samples and ship them for analysis other assays that we've got are for measuring the major metabolite in urine of thc which is 11-carboxy thc and we've supported quite a bit of research into comparing cannabinoid administration to the known endocannabinoids in our plasma it is thought that in several illnesses and things our endocannabinoid levels decrease which is why things like cbd help so um we have assays for anandamide and 2ag these are the endocannabinoids that are known to be effective in our body right so all i've got on this slide is really a case study of how we supported sativex for gw pharmaceuticals now sativex is another cannabinoid that is registered on the market it was registered by the european medical agency in 2010 for the help in multiple cirrhosis for spasticity i.e the the tightening of muscles that happens in multiple sclerosis and also for using cancer pain so as you can see from this slide we have supported multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies all the way through to registration of this medicine so with all this experience how can we support vaping studies while our chemists are dedicated in providing exceptional services and information and assurances we have reliable cannabinoid assays that are validated to fda and ema guidance we can also give you guidance regarding sample collection as it's easy to contaminate the samples especially when you're doing inhalation or topical administration studies and once we've got the samples and we've associated them we can give you the results and interpret the data for you in addition what we can do is give you the whole service of supplying you with sample collection kits logistics and central laboratory services in the next few slides i'm going to go into more detail of how we can support the whole clinical study for you as i've just mentioned we have complete central laboratory services from sample draw sample receipt to sample analysis results reporting and storage of samples and what can we do with these samples what when we've got them well as i've mentioned before we can analyze the cannabinoids and we've got a lot of pka by analysis experience over the last 20 years in our pk lab which is good laboratory practice and good clinical practice accredited so we've actually analyzed all sorts of different pharmaceutical products in this laboratory in addition if you're looking at how efficacious a cannabinoid is in a particular area such as pain or inflammation for example cbd is thought to be anti-inflammatory so what you can do with your samples is we can look at the levels of inflammatory cytokines in these samples both before and after administration of cbd so you've actually got some physical data to back up what you think it is good for in this slide i've also summarized our experience in nicotine and smoking and why we really feel that the time has come that people must look at more regulation and analysis around cbd and vaping and in the last column i've also summarized what our central laboratory can do for you as far as safety testing so here is just a slide showing the company history acm was actually formed in 1975 and has gradually expanded both geographically as well as functionally by strategic acquisition over the years and the pk laboratory abs was actually acquired in june 2018 this slide just shows you the global footprint of acm global laboratories you can see we have worldwide coverage but the two main laboratory facilities are actually in york in the uk and in rochester new york state in the u.s and we have other facilities in india singapore and china and this is our values our corporate values that are called epic basically we want to get things right first time every time and people are our priority whether they be patients customers partners or our own team members we try and be high in integrity and transparency when we're talking with everybody so that we can build trust with our customers and give you confidence in working with us and like i've done today we like to challenge the status quo and hopefully educate and innovate for the good of clinical development so my little presentation has come to the end hopefully i've highlighted to you the lack of pharmacokinetic information for cbd especially when it's administered by the vaping route so if you feel that you want any more information please ask me now or do not hesitate to go to our booth and speak to our colleagues and i'd like to thank you for your attention thank you", "g4tHSckLfGk": "[Music] [Music] only thing i care about is living life the best i could only want to smoke and stay productive till the day is done pull up to my day once kicking [ __ ] like day one then i played

and first i told her no but now i think i'll have a sip ever since i got my money right i'm smiling like the grinch and i don't give a [ __ ] about no sucker [ __ ] [ __ ] imma pull up screaming okay no [ __ ] that is it i show up to a 540 shake and make [Music] i bet they won't forget [Music] okay what is going on people of earth my name is chilly dilly back at you with another chill last video man and in today's video we're going to be reviewing the cake delta 8 cart [Music] okay so it is a disposable cart i said in my last video that if the video got 30 likes that i would do a review over this um over in my does delta get you high so if you haven't watched that definitely go watch that man um and i got 100 likes the first day so thank you guys so much that always shows the support um we're going to talk about this man uh so this is cake has actually been pretty popular i've heard it like locally i've seen it online i've seen other people review it and talk about it um and they never they didn't send me this like i paid for this with my own money uh and i gotta say it's definitely uh blowing my expectations away i would say that i'm pretty picky when it comes to like uh delta you know cards and edibles and disposables uh and this one definitely um almost i would say that it's just like a regular delta nine card because it gets me pretty [ __ ] baked so speaking of that let's go ahead take a hit off this this is what it looks like man very sleek like you know they really did a good job with the packaging the brand the way it looks they tried to go for the cookies look i kind of see so i respect it but they'll never hold up to cookies in my opinion but i definitely wish them the best obviously but cheers boys we're going to take off this i have to be careful not to hit this too much too big because um delta really makes me cough i don't know if that happens to you guys but it makes me cough my [ __ ] head off um do let me know what you guys are dabbing on eating on smoking on whether it's delta a delta nine uh definitely smoke along with me man i don't wanna smoke by myself and i just wanna go ahead and get this out of the way make sure to like comment subscribe all the good youtube stuff if you're new here man welcome aboard uh we just hit 2000 subs man it's [ __ ] awesome you guys are awesome definitely go start checking out my twitter though my instagram i definitely want to start building a social media following and all that stuff so definitely go do that man i don't get paid to do this so that's all i'm asking you to do okay cheers boys we're gonna take another good hit okay okay so it's lemon cush it's an indica 940 milligrams so it's not fully a grain technically um anyway so it's um my phone's blowing up total thc is says zero percent total cbd can total total connect total cannabinoids is 93 um it has the legal amount of technically thc in it 0.3 um has delta a and flavored terpenes like i said the box is very nice you can scan here to see like all the [ __ ] that you need to know like i said i really love the packaging i love what they did here like i just think they did a really good job and it like i said it's lemon kush it definitely tastes like lemon man and with just a little bit of like kush terps honestly men they definitely got that flavor down to a science uh and you can see on the side it uh shows how much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like you want this one i'm like sure um but i would almost be willing to try another flavor man um if this video you know let's try to get 40 likes man if this video gets 40 likes i'll that'll let me know that you guys still want to see more delta videos more delta reviews um yeah i'm already getting kind of high off this man it's not like obviously like a delta 900 it's not like super psychoactive uh but it is very calming and very relaxing and my body feels really like just chill my eyes feel really good it is an indica so i mean but let's go ahead and keep taking some hits man let's get [ __ ] high [ __ ] on this okay [Music] and let me know in the comments man um me and my girlfriend do a lot of hikes and stuff during um the summer let me know if you guys want to see any like delta nature sessions you know just like hiking matrix sessions in general so yeah definitely in the comments if you guys would ever want to see that man and definitely shoot any dozer uh products that you think that i would maybe like or that maybe you'd want to see me try maybe i could pick it up with somebody or you know we'll see but uh let's just keep it in this man [Music] so seriously though i mean this disposable actually does get me high compared to where the other one i had was not really that good and i'm a big fan i'm a sucker for disposable stuff like i said um so i definitely would say this is the best disposable delta a pod or delta pen that i've had disposable um love the packaging love everything about it love the taste my girlfriend really likes this she even has been spoken on this a lot and says it really gets her to the you know that right high that she wants so yeah i mean i'm not sponsored i'm not telling you to buy it i'm just telling you that this is a good brand if you are looking for disposable pots it has a light down here to let you know like uh that you're hitting it i don't know if you could take a blinker on it i tried it when i first got it in the other video and i literally coughed for 10 minutes so i'm not really trying to do that again it also has a k right here i don't really know what that means but [Music] i mean it still looks really cool uh yeah man i mean i don't really have much else to say about this this gets the job done you will get high smokiness um well i can't fully say that you will i do and i feel like it would definitely get most people high because i spent a lot of time tonight um it's a heavy hitter tastes great great packaging i think you can buy them for like 30 bucks maybe 30 bucks online i'm not really sure i picked 35 at a gas station though but that's what you get right man let's take one good last hit on this let's go ahead and bow man um if you guys did enjoy the review let me know in the comments make sure to like comment subscribe let's take a big hit let's peace out boys all right much love i will see you guys in the next video all right peace you"}
