{"lc0z4g_itP4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I am going to be doing a review slash not first impression but kind of first impression of the flourish macaroons so I have actually been a fan of flourish edibles for such a long time one of my first edibles as a medical marijuana patient was a flourish edible I believe it was there oh I can actually tell you for sure I had two s'mores this is so this is kind of my first edible ever story back in the day the first out of all I ever tried was a flourish 40 milligram s'more and it came in like a whole pack I think was a pack four or a pack of six and I had two of them so that was 80 milligrams and mind you you're supposed to like micro dose in the beginning you're supposed to have like you know a small dose go back later and you know try a little bit more if you feel like you need some more so what I did was I was like I'm not gonna look like a little [ __ ] so I ate two s'mores and I remember I was sitting on my couch and I thought I was gonna die I was like oh my god I'm either gonna throw up or pass out and I don't want to throw up because I'm gonna look like such an idiot if I throw up from these edibles so I just passed out I went to sleep and ever since then I've been eating a hundred milligrams and I've been good thought my first Arizona edible experience I had some edibles in Colorado that were like mint and that they were low dose but this is my first like high dose edible experience and it was crazy but I'll never forget it I'll never forget seeing on my couch being like oh my god I don't know but it was fun and I'll never forget that being like a flourish edible I was like a die-hard fan of their brownies of their hundred milligram birthday cake bars and their cake pops and I even got a birthday cake from flourish I I hope I can find the picture my Instagram my weed Instagram got deleted it was actually MMJ deals AZ then it was asked me about my wiener and then it was a little marijuana and it got deleted and it's kind of sad because it was my like archive of like all the things all the products that I used to like everything that I've used in the past and unfortunately don't have that anymore but I was lucky enough that I won a contest an Instagram contest with flourish where they made me a birthday cake it was rose gold and the baker at the time who worked for them Vicki she was so excited to give it to me and all their other bakers that I love so much I've had like a long history with flourish I visited their kitchen up in Williams and I used to love their original macaron which they made a long time ago they took it off the market and then they because they're kind of hard to make the consistency in the formula of macaroons you have to get it just right in order to like get that shell perfect but they brought them back the Mac is back okay sorry my like cheesy moment is over this is the pack that I got you get 650 milligram macaroons so you got a total of 300 milligrams of macaroons in this pack this box is $38 and through the end of the year at harvest of Scottsdale I'm not sure about all the other harvest locations but I know for sure harvest of Scottsdale they're doing a buy one get one on all of the flourish products so I actually got to macaron boxes first $38 as you can see this box has already been consumed I had some already and I eat them in like hundred milligram doses don't eat too and let me just tell you these were gooey yesterday like I felt amazing so I'm gonna do the same thing today where I eat two of these and then I'll check back with you guys in probably like an hour an hour and a half after I eat them and I'll let you know how I'm feeling yesterday they were so good it is approximately 4:20 p.m. and I'm going to be eating two of the flourish macaroons these are in flavor in Nutella so it has been about an hour since I ate my macaroons and I think that they're working do you think that they're working [Music] thank you guys so much for watching I enjoyed those edibles so much before I go I just want to give a quick shout out to Emily Amanda and Vicky from flourish whether they're still with flourish or whether they were on the onboarding team for flourish edibles these three women specifically had a huge impact on my views on the cannabis industry as a whole they showed me that there is room for women in this field and that it's possible to make a difference on people's lives because they made a huge difference on mine um so thank you so much to them they showed me their kitchen back in the day when I was a new patient and the experiences just kind of shaped my goals in this industry to make an impact to teach people about this medicine so thank you to them thank you to you guys for watching if you like this video please give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel hit that notification bellow so you're notified every single time I post and I'll see you guys next time bye", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "7U_ET0_HVOw": "oh hi guys just enjoying some splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "6sBWiwLyvK4": "[Music] no till uh orange spatula sick you're a long time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the next review thanks for watching peace pretty good hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "5BXoeB5n-YE": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super super excited because we are taking another look at flourish the first time we have taken a look at flourish in almost a year we are going to be reviewing their new flavor their hybrid grand-jury n-- gummies so a mixture of tangerine and cranberry really excited about this if you've seen in my florist reviews before these are my favorite gummies hands-down there are no gummies that come even close to the magnificence of flourish I love them love them love them a lot and I hope that this cran Jurina gummy does the trick as well so this is a 300 milligram edible picked it up for the leave $20 at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 300 milligram edible and it is for show it is a if it's like any of the other so it's gonna be tasty and it is going to be potent on the back here you got everything you want to see you've got your nutrition information your ingredients all that wonderful stuff there on the back this is a hybrid variety so it doesn't tell us what strain but this is a hybrid strain that they used so let's go ahead and open it up here and take a look at what we got oh it's different than it used to be this is not the way they used to have a package they used to have a package in one thing now there are four individually packaged gummies just like this still in there ziggurat shape let's go ahead and open up this cran doreen hybrid here and give it a taste new smells wonderful smells so good hmm now there is a slight weed taste to this one which I actually encouraged by means that there might be as all of that milligram \u00e4j-- as promised but it still tastes really good good solid fruity flavor like the texture like everything about it mm well flourish hits it out of the park again when it comes to the taste texture packaging all that love the packaging love this little box love it all but the most important part is it still gonna get me high cuz it's been a year who knows if they've changed the formula what the case may be for that guys you're gonna have to wait two hours oh no you're not gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know exactly how this flourish cran Doreen 300 milligram has landed I'm gonna finish those other two pieces off and for you guys it'll be just a couple of seconds so thanks for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit several hours since I've had the hybrid flourish 300 milligram cran Jurina gummy and I am pleased as punch to say it is as potent as it ever was another knock it out of the park homerun sports metaphor for flourish I really like this one real quick it didn't have the most cannabis II taste of any of the flourish gummies I've ever had then again it's a 300 milligram edible certainly that potent at least in my estimation I got me up to like eight and a half somewhere in that range or maybe even a little higher and that was actually spread out over about five hours I only had about the first half of it over two hours and then took the second half two hours later just in the circumstances I was in it has sustained me there's 300 milligram edible has kept me high for about going on about five hours now so really we're impressed with its longevity with this flourish again just the taste outside the cannabis part was good I like the consistency like the like the texture of the gummy it's so much better than at a pure or infused creations even with that slight cannabis taste in terms of that bitterness that awful as cerebral cannabis tastes it's not present here just a slight cannabis taste and I'm harping on it too much it's just I surprised me I've never really tasted any cannabis in their products before but there was it was here but it lets you know it's gonna be as potent as it is I really really enjoyed this one another absolute - thumbs up for flourish for me sorry I've been rambling a little bit but before I go I want to share with you guys my little cherry on top something that is not necessarily weed related but could be really weed related that you guys might want to check out and on this cherry on top I want to share with you an excellent movie from 2017 one of my favorites from 2017 and that is Briggs bbear starring Kyle Mooney of the Saturday Night Live Fame he always plays this sort of dorky guy long kind of curly hair anyways it's the story of a guy who lives in a fallout shelter and every day gets a new tape of his hero Briggs B bear who tells him a different story and adventure about his galactic life and it's about this kid's obsession with this bear that he knows brings B bear and I don't want to spoil too much more because the movie goes in unexpected places and it is easily spoiled so if you are at all interested in something and this probably goes pretty well with weed to be honest so if you're interested in something that's gonna be a little bit different than most movies that you've seen be sure to check out brings to bear I want to make sure that it let you know that this is one of the most optimistic heartwarming movies I've seen in some I'm there are adult situations and language and all that in there but this is not a cynical mean-spirited movie even though it does feature some again adult situations check it out again Briggs to be there really really enjoyed that one and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you making it to the very very end guys thank you so much and we will see you guys all on the next review peace", "M-QREv9LFV8": "[Music] hi friends welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are taking our second look at a gummy a gummy manufacture that I quite liked the first time I reviewed and that is tiki killer's tiki killer's this was a real surprise for me the first time I reviewed it is a 300 milligram edible this time it's peach flavor we reviewed the green apple the first time it surprised me in many ways one gummies rarely get me high just I find them to be usually less potent than this sort of confectionaries but this one got me nice and high too for its price normally things you know in the edible world you get what you pay for a 300 milligram edible for 15 bucks especially in this sort of not so nice packaging it's just sort of a ziploc bag with some kind of stickers on the front and back you know it's not the nicest packaging and usually that's a sign of you know a bad omen but in the first case it worked out well so I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke and I just didn't get a great batch or something so I decided to go ahead and pick up another one and give it a review as well to see if you know they are another gummy brand worth investing in so let's go ahead and open up the tiki killers peach 300 milligram here and give it a taste and if this is your first time tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work real simple I'm gonna eat this product here and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours for you it'll be just a couple of seconds I'll just edit right together and you'll see exactly just exactly how high this product got me because that's the most important part of the edible review right is finding out exactly how high you're gonna get you know is it gonna work for you or is it gonna just be a waste of money that's what we're here for it we so I do like the sculpt of these gummies there are these cool little like Tiki shaped things here boo boo boo boo like I'm covered in some granulated sugar as well the taste in the green apple is great let's give a the peachy go well that has a very peachy flavor actually there must be some real peach in there actually I mean there's just like cannabis taste to it but compared to a lot of other gummies I mean this is this is amber ogia this is good stuff again there's a slight slight cannabis taste so if you can't stand any taste a weed you know maybe give it a skip but for gummies this is great there are four of them in the package this is 75 milligrams each I'm gonna finish these guys off if you watch too and then I will see you in two hours thanks for watching witch guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace Oh quick addendum I should mention I had fat before before I consume these just a little bit before I had these so I did have some fat already so I didn't forget to take fat I just didn't take any additional fat during the video but I did have some right before this so so rest assured consistency in our experiments is key here at wheats thanks for watching sorry about the the late-breaking news talk to you soon [Music] just ate some spicy food that's why I got them all I'm all sweaty here just well probably not spicy for any of you listening but spicy for me I'm a real real [ __ ] when it comes to the spicy stuff I like it I just just can't really handle it handle it but what I can handle although I am handling it not as easily as I would have thought is the Tiki Killers that's two for two for the Tiki Killers I am quite high I would say I'm at a six so I again this is a $15.00 edible for a 300 milligram err I got a discount I believe I got it for 13 bucks so a pretty good value most gummies like comparatively the 200 milligram cuz she punch is twenty dollars I don't know I mean like I'm not gonna suggest that this 300 milligrams is equivalent to their 200 milligrams or anything like that but I dunno if you like gummies it's a pretty good value it got me quite high it's quite tasty it's got shitty packaging and I just now noticing you can kind of see there if it doesn't shimmer too much some like oily residue left in that package which is probably just the way that the the way they get the tea and it's probably just cannabis oil of some kind leftover but I I really like Tiki Killers it's good stuff still probably wouldn't be my first choice for gummy edibles I think I would still reach for flourish first but if I saw these in my dispensary and wasn't looking for some kind of confectionery was looking for something a little bit easy you know quicker to eat less calories and they had Tiki killers there I grabbed them I've give him a shot um they're definitely two for two and they seem to be pretty reliable so guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats if you enjoyed this review please do me a favor give me one of those little thumb yuppies subscribeee also you can even follow me on twitter a tweets reviews or give me a like on the facebook at wheats reviews on facebook as well i would super appreciate

concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I hate the whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear yo somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo Davey to the nurse dawg so if by now I have been completely and thoroughly shatters the illusion that I was the angel ik horrific kid that my parents believed I was back in the day this uh this video will surely fix it so this takes place back in high school back in Georgia to Jamaica Jamaica yeah man I was about 14 years old so one morning I get to school and I'm just chilling in my home classroom before the first school bell rings were one of my boys who will call Jeff comes up to me with a big smile on his face he's like yo Don how much lunch money you got today man so automatically I'm like god damn boy I just got a school man why is you begging me for money already dog can't I'll live he's like Don chill just just tell me how much lunch one you got man so I'm like 500 this is Jamaican dollars of course and at a time $300 was a reasonable amount for a day's worth of lunch money but my mama loved me a little bit extra so you know she'd often give me 500 just for context back then I 100 Jamaican dollars was equal to like one American dollar so I told him how much money I got and then he is like cool cool okay okay you should go half with me on a brown so I'm like brownie what brownies is there like a bake sale going on or something just like done no bro I'm talking about Leroy's and brownies dogs so I'm like oh snap Leroy that big dark-skinned dude I'm good I know Leroy he looks like the kind of guy that would scratch himself and then put his hand back in the batter without washing his hands I think I'm gonna have to take a hard pass on that one and Jeff was like done you know about these brownies huh I'm like what about them then Jeff's eyes lit up in that special way that people's eyes light up when they know a secret that you don't you leans in and whispers God these are magic brownies I look at Jeff and I'm like you're kidding he doesn't even say anything just stood there smiling I gave Jeff all of my lunch money you see by this time a lot of dudes in our grade were experimenting with magic but they were only using magic inhalers and that didn't really appeal to me but I was still curious about magic so when Jeff told me about the magic brownies I was like that sounds lazy so yeah I was like sign me up so Jeff takes my money in dips ow 10 minutes later he comes back to me enhance me my brownie wrapped up in foil paper he tells me that I should wait on till lunchtime to eat it and that I should only eat half so I'm like cool I got it I was pumped I couldn't wait till lunch fast forward to lunchtime and everybody has brownies like Leroy Maybank that day man so I'll find Jeff and I'm sitting with him and a group of friends and then we all ate our brownies so we're sitting there in 15 minutes or so passes and I'm not not really feeling anything also lunch was gonna end in less than 30 minutes so I started to get a little impatient on top of that I spent all my lunch money on this dang brownie tomorrow was Heike hungry I didn't have anything else to eat so I hate the rest of the brownie the whole thing I eat the whole thing I even lick the icing off the foil paper man so I'm sitting there and then Jeff comes over to me and he's like yo dumb and how you feeling bro and then I'm like hungry man and a little disappointed I had to hold brownie still pretty hungry and I really feeling any magic as soon as I said that Jeff's face changed from happy and magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I had no whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo take me to the nurse dawg I look over to where the noise was coming from and I see this dude let's call him Amar'e screaming and running across the schoolyard then he gets tackled by some of the other students they bring him over and my man's is tripping hard he was sweating mumbling gibberish trying to take off his shirt just completely losing it so I'm like yo what happened to him and then one of his friends was like man that boy had a whole brownie dog I guess Leroy made this batch extra strong made this batch extra strong I'm instantly begin to panic I mean I was going to die and certainly I was I was going to die obviously here's why Amar'e was one of those dudes that was known to take part in the use of magic inhalers after school so you understand what I'm saying this this guy was an experienced magic user he was an experienced magic user and was still going insane I on the other hand have never used magic and I ate the exact same amount of brownie as he did I was so there I am just panicking internally awaiting my certain death I was sweating profusely I look sick just from the worry and anxiety then Jeff comes over to me and is like yo Don how you feelin man then I was like oh no bro I still don't feel anything too crazy man and it was like as soon as I said that BAM give me and here's the thing when it comes to eating management unlike inhaling it when you eat it he doesn't gradually come on to you one you're fine just chilling and then out of nowhere it's like a magical fairy comes over to you and bashes you over the head with her magic bit sending you straight into lala land I was on it was so bad that I ended up skipping all my classes after lunch there were three distinct feelings that I remember from being under magic spell the first was that time was moving in slow motion and I don't just mean my sense of time which did happen the last 10 minutes of lunch felt like an hour but I mean visually the best way I can describe it is like a visual echo for example let's say someone wave their hand in front of my face it was like their hand left a trail of hands as it moved along its path it completely tripped me out the second feeling was that my sense of touch became hyperstimulated I remember just sitting on the floor in complete agony because the wrinkles in my uniform hurt when my skin rubbed over there like I would rest my arm on my pants and the bulges in the fabric fell as if they were trying to pierce through my skin absolutely awful the last feeling was severe anxiety I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life where I experienced a real traumatic panic attack I was so worried about what you ask I remember in particular I was dreading that my mom was going to pick me up from school and see that I used magic and then kill me so for like the four hours between lunch and when I was supposed to get picked up from school I just sat on the floor Hannah can that my mom was gonna be just so disappointed and angry with me but here's the thing my mom never picked me up from school and I mean never she has a nine-to-five job she's a manager at Bank she's never picked me up from school but for some reason I was convinced that she was coming to get me and when she did she was going to murder me in front of all of my friends but of course instead a taxicab pick me up the same taxicab that had been picking me up every day from school for the prior three years so when I say that it made no sense that I was convinced that my mom was gonna pick me up I mean I have absolutely no idea I thought that but that's what you'd imagine community especially when you eat it at 14 years old so I get home and I immediately just went a bit I slept for like four hours got up and then proceeded to eat all the food in the house all of it like everyone's dinner that my aunt had cooked that afternoon and put in the fridge like four plates of food my G I ate all of it and then went back to sleep moral of the story kids don't do magic man it's a powerful stuff big shout out to the best

we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super excited because we are reviewing a product I love a lot loved in my entire life love de ma since I've been four years old and we are reviewing Nutter Butter bytes the snack seals real peanut butter edition you can grab them you can share them you can zip them and take them anytime anywhere that is the Nutter Butter bytes promise the peanut butter lovers cookie I'm just [ __ ] with you we're actually reviewing peanut butter another butter bytes if you like Nutter Butter bytes but I've got these here because I'm actually out of my real substance Nutella which is what I like to take before I review any remedies that's right what we're really reviewing today is T key killers what a name T key killers gummies these guys right here they're coming fancy looking little T shapes kind of cool-looking so this is a 300 milligram edible green apple flavor and it cost me $15 at my dispensary got it at a $2 discount so 13 bucks if this is really a 300 milligram edible great deal I gotta admit I'm already a little apprehensive because one gummies rarely work for me outside of flourish and occasionally cookie or cushy punch and too rarely do you get these edibles that are cheaper that have a lot of milligram \u00e4j-- that actually seem to pan out it works sometimes sometimes you really do get good deals but often especially when they have sort of suspect packaging like tiki killers here which is just a ziploc bag and a couple of stickers they can be misleading because they really have no there's no regulation there's no reason that they can't about their mill agreement so why not outside I've screwing their customers I'm not suggesting they're doing that let's give them the full review here first and make sure and and and you know give them a fair shake but I'm just letting you know I'm a little apprehensive okay so as I said this is the TT killers 300 milligram apple green apple flavor if you've never tuned in 2 weeks before their way our reviews work is I'm going to eat this product maybe not the entire thing in front of you but I will eat this whole thing over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling or I'll just edited it through and you'll see me in a couple seconds and I'll say guys I'm super high or guys I'm super not high okay so here we go we've got one of the little gummy pieces right here it's actually a quite a little handsome gummy I like the sculpt on it quite a bit so let's go ahead and plop her in my mouth this is a very cool looking gummy well tasty no real cannabis taste good green apple tastes good get me taste some nice sugar coating on this outside good gummy um like the taste is that got me quite a bit help a lot better than like the infused creations or a tap here or any of those kind of gummies um but what it's really gonna have to come down to oh I could eat some Nutter butters I always like to have a little fat before I consume any gummy edibles just because the THC is fat activated so or as fat soluble normally I have Nutella but I'm out okay well I'm gonna finish off these Tiki killers and I will see you guys in two hours or through the magic of editing just a couple of seconds to let you know I'm feeling thanks for watching weights guys and I will see you in just a bit peace alright guys it's been two hours since I had the Tiki killer or killers Ikki I can't really remember which way it was to be honest than 300 milligrams which might be a good sign for the product because I am rather pleased with it I'm very surprised I was I was a doubting Thomas and Here I am in accepting Andrew it's not perfect I would say I'm at like a 6 right now but it tasted great I am hi I am unpleasantly hi and and for a dummy it was it's it's it's almost up there with flourish in terms of quality again it tasted really good no cannabis taste whatsoever I really like the design of the becoming I know that doesn't really mean much but hey I like it and it you know I tasted really good and I'm unpleasantly high I wish our maybe were just a little bit higher for a 300 more for an edible but you know I can't fault it too much because it is still one of the best companies I've ever had outside of flourish and so guys I'm really pleased with TP killer or killers EE I'm sorry I couldn't remember their name but I'm looking forward to reviewing some more of their products to see if they're gonna say nice and consistent and with that guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later review peace", "xqNKMAdXw80": "excuse me I say always double and it was pretty good brownie bliss herbal edibles we just been trying a few different edibles out there and the one that's really standing out to me right now that was just super dank was this bait kush here so I'm just going to zoom in here see you all can see the label and know what to pick up when you're out that the night shop this is the truth to chase that uh-huh slur my words obviously these edibles are hitting me right now but of great products from all these guys all these different vendors but what can I say bait kush was the winner", "vI1xGhoRBYI": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are taking another look at another product from flourish my favorite gummy manufacturer and we are taking a look at their 150 milligrams sativa variety the pineapple flavor today so again this is the 150 milligram they also have 300 milligram varieties this is the pineapple flavor let's get right into it today this is the first time you've tuned in to a week's review the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this gummy and then I'll come back to you guys in about this time a little bit later than two hours I'm on my way to go see baby driver and after I get out of the movie I'll let you know guys know how I'm feeling so probably closer about two and a half three hours I'll let you guys know how this edible is working and then I'll come back to you and let you know for sure so here we go down the hatch pineapple flavoured 150 milligrams and just like its predecessors tastes pretty good well it's got that strong gelatin texture um and a just slight weed aftertaste mostly a pretty neutral pretty easy to digest pineapple flavor without a lot of weed taste it's quite good mmm okay well not much else to say about it other than how is it gonna get me feeling and for that guys it's gonna take about two hours and I'll see you right after this movie see then thank you so much for watching wheat and we'll check you out soon peace welcome back to weeds guys it's been oh man about three hours now since I had the flourish 150 milligrams gummy here and I'm still feeling pretty high I am just as impressed with these as I was last time that I reviewed the I think mango flavor of the hundred and fifty milligrams the these guys seem to be super consistent again rated by SC labs so you can feel pretty confident in them that they're going to be pretty consistent and that seems to be the case as I said three hours later still feel pretty high and I still feel pretty high on baby driver if it's playing out of thin air neater you definitely go see it and if you've got a flourish coming in a dispensary near you definitely feel free to go ahead and grab it because they are great man just like the movie the gummy is just as good as the movie and the movie is just as good as the gummy sorry I'm rambling I'm pretty high still thank you so much for watching weeds guys we will check you out on the next review and I hope the next review is just as good as this one and I hope it's just as good as baby driver because they are both incredible thank you so much for watching wheats peace great one goodbye", "EECZVB7hLMw": "Hi everybody my name's Paul I'm a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Do we have the slides There we go. We're up and running. Welcome Thank you all for being here. Today we're talking about pharmacology of today's marijuana My name's Paul I have a masters degree in addiction studies from Hazelden School of Addiction Studies, licensed alcohol and drug counselor in Minnesota and Nevada and prefered provider for State of Nevada Nurses Association. I have experience in residential intensive outpatient outpatient counseling. Hazelton Betty Ford Foundation, past LADC for the University and the continuing education instructor continue to do that for UNR State certified intern supervisor and I'm currently withThree Nations Tribal Center. You know when I got into addiction studys and trying to help people I came from the pharmaceutical industry and uh I saw that with addiction it was something that I thought that I could help out people real quickly see a turn around and help them become productive members of society and lead fulfilling lives. So my idea when I got into this was completely different than the actual reality just like my idea when I got into pharmaceutical sales was completely different than the reality I'm doing a lot of talking about the opioid epidemic and so it's either opioids or marijuana that everybody's interested in at this point and so I did pharmaceuticals when I started there I thought, hey I'm going to be partnering with the physician I'm gonna tell them all these great drugs that they can help people with that are going to, they're going to appreciate seeing me and it's going to be a one-two punch it's going to be great and I'm going to be able to avoid 13 years of school and all those student loans and oh isn't this a wonderful wonderful idea. So I explained that to a doctor as I was leaving that industry and they say yeah that was rather naive wasn't it, and I guess it was. So with addiction the addition strikes first spiritually then hits emotionally then hits mentally and then manifest physically when it manifests physically we have to get all that junk out of the person system and start the healing process which is exactly the opposite of the way that it that is being impacted negatively so you get that physical back first and the physical is called detox. Then we get the mental back, the mind is resilient once you get the junk out of the persons system and they're able to remember what happened yesterday or the week before they start getting really excited about recovery. Then emotionally this is where we spend most of our time in addiction treatment it's working with the anger issues the depression the anxiety the relationships, all life issues that come with, no matter where you are in your stage of development. This is where we spend our time, and then spiritually finally and that manifests in the person's own conception of their higher power it's not a religion or anything that we're pushing. So when coming from the pharmaceutical industry from what I proceeded from what I heard it was kind of false compared to reality when I look at my experience now from what I perceived or when I was going into it, it's not as accurate as reality. When we're talking about marijuana we're going to try to look at reality like what's going on here really, so we're going to review the active com components describe the delivery systems and discuss data. So NRS revised statues marijuana means all of the plant so when they're talking about all this they're talking about the different compounds and 66 are termed cannabinoids so they're talking about the whole plant. So when you hear marijuana it'a a umbrella term but what's happening now is we're selling one actual component that's THC. These cannabinoids are separated in the following subclasses so because of time we're going to talk about cannabidol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC or delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol that's the main, the marijuana's main psychoactive ingredient. Increases appetite and reduces nausea and may also reduce pain. We say psychoactive ingredient THC is actually the plants natural pesticide an animal will come up they'll munch on the plant, it'll feel kind of weird and it'll say, you know what I'm going to avoid that weed I'm going to avoid that plants in the future I'm gonna remember this because it makes me feel weird. But you give it to a human being and they say it makes you feel weird give me more. CBD reduces negative effects of THC as anti-inflammatory, anti-convulsant, anti-psychotic and analgesic processes. CBD is the most abundent of the cannabinoids it makes up about forty percent of the plant thought to have anti-anxiety effects possibly counteracting the psychoactive effects of THC and this is the stuff that you hear about for multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, epilepsy, and providing relief from chronic pain due to muscle spasticity convulsions and infamation. So we look at THC and we recognize THC is a partial agonist to the CB receptor the CB receptor there's three, we're thinking that there's three different receptor sites we'll get into that in a little bit, but that's one of the largest receptor sites that we have in the body CBD that's your antagonist so here you got your yin and your yang you get your balancing act. So the even amounts of THC and CBD nullify the intoxicating effects. CBD is being bred out of today's marijuana to intensify the intoxicating effects. When you're going into a pot shop and your checking out different marijuana they're telling you about how much THC is in there you can get up to about 40% anything more than that it's not going to be able to hold the consistency of the plant and then you're getting more into the hash oil and to the dabs. So we look at delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol and we look at the chemical structure so you see anandamide that's the brains natural chemical that's created to be recycled is created to go fast and gently delicately, make an impact give this message and then return back to be recycled. THC on the other hand is actually a lot more harsh and lasts a lot longer so the messages are not getting just received they're getting blanketed so think about anandamide kind of as a electrical current when you flip on the switch to a light. You flip it on there goes the light. THC's like the dimmer switch dimmer switch which will slow down everything and dim it for a considerable amount of time depending on the amount of THC that the person suggested. So here we go with the cannabinoid receptors. The receptors control appetite regulation, peripheral energy metabolism, pain and inflammation, GI motility/secretion, neuroinflammation. CB1 is found in the nervous system, connective tissues, gonads and organs. CB2 in the immune system There we go. There's our cannabinoid receptors and when we're looking at the cannabinoid receptors look at the brain. It's tough to tell where one receptor ends and one begins see those clusters up there that's how everything is being regulator or perception of these receptors are what ever is being impacted is what's telling the person a message. So we saw a big receptor system saw the different compounds. We're looking at the different forms of delivery now. This is, see how complicated everything can get really quickly? So again smoking looking at E-cigarettes it can be vaporized it can be added to food brewed in tea or other beverages and so we'll go through these different forms of delivery. We'll start with smoking so you take those 400 compounds of the marijuana plant that becomes over 2,000 compounds when combusted so we got 2,000 compounds going to these receptors in the CB1 and CB2 So the smoking delivers toxins as well as potentially therapeutic compounds. This is why if you have three people smoking a joint one can have the munchies and feel kind of giggly the other one can feel kind of off-balance and just zoning out Are you picturing these people? And then the third one could be fricken paranoid, afraid the police are going to get them afraid that their parents are going to find out. Why is that? It's because THC is impacting different parts of the person's brain so we'll take a quick tour of the brain and we'll show what areas are producing what behavior. So the neocortex you know that prefrontal cortex area begins to mature around the age of 25. So when adolescents are being introduced to marijuana or today's marijuana it's impacting their brain they don't have the executive functioning or a full mature stop sign to say this is not a good idea. So if it feels good they go forward so when we're in the healthcare professional roll or we're in the parental role we have to look at ourselves as surrogate prefrontal cortexes for those who are younger. We have to actually look out for the little people and make sure that they are not being impacted negatively or they're doing something that will impact your potential. Now we'll look at the basal ganglia and when I was working with students my athletes were really interested in this area because this is reaction time. So when we're looking at reaction time this is something that they are very interested in especially if there is potential to continue moving on or they're really engaged, or they need their reaction time to keep that scholarship going. They're also interested in the cerebellum in the back over there, that takes care of emotion but also balance so balance and coordination. So when they come to me stay in the University I had a lot of students who were coming to me wanting to get off of marijuana and this was one of the tools that I used to let them recognize internally what impact they are making on different areas of their brain. And this is an effective way of having them choose to discontinue using. So lets go to the nucleus accumbens, here's a little troublemaker. Nucleus accumbens is what gives us that dopamine release and the pleasure pathway as a ventral tegmental area so that's not in this slide. Gives the signal to the nucleus accumbens nucleus accumbens says hey this is good I'm going to give some dopamine to the prefrontal cortex prefrontal cortex is going to say hey let's go forward with this activity it's good for our survival it's good for us let's do it again. Hippocampus remembers it and we continue with that with that action. So look at dopamine release, if you introduce food to somebody who's hungry you get a score of about 50 so say your cruising around 100 everything's doing ok and you get an impact of 50 you say hey I'm going to remember that, that's good I'm going to to eat again. You get sex, that's around 2 and a quarter that's the highest internal dopamine release we can achieve that's for procreation that's to keep our species going. You have dope or marijuana you have alcohol you have different drugs that you're stirring around 300's. So would a person rather do one of those activities that give them pure natural dopamine release or would you rather just get the dopamine release? Here's the thing all of the stuff that have the natural dopamine releases take effort it takes no effort when somebody gets high. So in some of these numbers can get go off the charts with high here's the problem now we have something to compare natural activity to and they can obtain that dopamine release any time of the day any without any effort. The hypothalamus that's eating, that's for our friend who had the munchies. Amygdala this is, this is for our friend who is paranoid who thought the police were after him. Now you hear marijuana is good for PTSD. Okay let's see your study, how many people are in your study, what's the p-value, is it valid or reliable? Oh none of that stuff I just know a veteran who smokes pot and he likes it well your experience does not constitute a reliable and valid study. How about the veteran who smokes pot that 2,000 chemicals turns into impacting the amygdala now we have somebody with PTSD who's amygdala is impacted and their prefrontal cortex is impacted so we've actually started a chain of events with a panic panic mode and we've actually made the person worse. So this is one of the things when we're taking a chance; one you don't know what you're getting you don't know where it's going, you can tell by the person's description or by their behaviour where it's impacting but you won't know until he gets there that's why when somebody smokes marijuana you don't know where it's going. The hippocampus this is for my artists and my musicians they really like when we talk about how marijuana keeps them in the now, keeps them focused on what's going on. Well that's good for the moment but unfortunately the hippocampus as you know it's more of a filter and it says what's not important what's not important and so it tries to capture what is important take a snapshot of it when the hippocampus is impacted with THC it's saying nothing is really important except for what's in front of me becomes very novel. It's why TV is suck a great babysitter. Now if somebody's smoking and you want to test it ask them to recite or read a couple pages then recite what they just read and it's not the best study aid because they're not going to remember. Brainstem anti-nausea effects. Here's the thing with the brainstem, remember back here, I was talking to an ER doc and she said that the person had was throwing up consistently always throwing up . You think whoa what's going? Well she narrowed it down to the marijuana use. What? I thought that was anti-nausea, she said she believed that too until the brain gut connection was actually promoting a nauseous reflex and so this was keeping that person throwing up. Spinal cord the altered pain and sensitivity. Now remember pain is not and I go through this with my opioid talks. Pain gets a bad rap, remember the 5th vital sign? That sales technique that was very very productive in selling oxycontin. Pain has a reason now unproductive pain or chronic pain there are ways to deal with that as opposed to just masking it because of opioids the only answer is more. I'm finding the same thing with marijuana if you have somebody who's smoking just the Mexican ragweed that took half of half a garbage bag to catch the hay you know back the, 20 years ago or so, the answer there if somebody's smoking consistently is more, more THC more potent to get the same impact Aspirin okay so we're looking at marijuana this is an offside kind of example but when you're looking at maijuana what they're saying really is like you, a person comes into the physician's office to say you know I have a headache or my blood checked And the doctor says go to my orchard chop down a willow tree, grind it up and start smoking because you know we get the aspirin from the bark of the willow tree or a compound. So the person needs to sell their willow tree so this is what they're willing to do to their patient population. That is as ridiculous as a lot of the arguments that I here with marijuana. Okay American Lung Association this is lots of words on these slides. I'll go through it relatively quickly but somebody was saying that it was good for, marijuana was good for cancer and it helped them with their asthma. And it reminded me remember back when with tobacco when cigarettes where being smoked by physicians and my physician smokes camels and Dr. Baddies asthma cigarettes. It provided me with a saturday Night Live skit I don't know if you guys have seen this but it's the one where kid come into his dad and says you know I got a splinter in my hand in the dad says oh put some butter on it. And then the kid comes in he's got a scrape on his leg and the dad says oh put some butter on it. And he keeps on getting more and more outrageous till the kid has actually lost his arm and he has an artery that's spurting out blood and the dad says put some butter on it. That's the message that everyone is getting now about marijuana They say if you have any kind of issue any kind of problem then smoke some marijuana. take care of everything Our obligation is to do no harm or to at least look at the risk and benefit and have the benefits outweigh the risks when promoting a product to someone American Lung Association this is straight from their information. Smoke is harmful to lung health. Doesn't matter if it's tobacco or marijuana, you know marijuana has more carcinogens then tobacco doea. Tobacco is getting a bad rap if you ask any of the younger people now about tobacco they're like oh that's horrible that's bad for you How about marijuana? No that's green that's natural that's not a problem at all. Do you know when the government you know what decade.the government-linked cancer to tobacco? I hear the 60's I hear the 50's sometimes. It was the 20's 1920's it took all of that time to the 90's before the government said you know what we're going to shut you down unless you clean up your act and so the tabacco industry said okay you know what we're going to do that we're going to put a little black box warning and we're going to pay a 10 billion dollar check and we're going to actually change our name from Phillip Morris to another name and you know what their tobacco sales throughout the world right now are better off then they've ever been before. If you think Microsoft brings in some big money Microsoft and Coke and Starbucks you take all three of those combined you're not getting as much money as the tobacco industry is hitting. In the third world countries they're using the same adds as they used previously and we can see the same script for marijuana. So it doesn't matter how the lungs get the carcinogen as long as they get it were introducing something negative to that person Then look at how people smoke cigarettes and then look at how people smoke marijuana. If you've ever seen that it looks like they're going to the last breath of their life. I don't know who inhales more deeply somebody who's suffocating or drowning or somebody trying to get the next hit off their pipe. Marijuana clearly damages the human lung regular use leads to chronic bronchitis and can cause an immune compromised person to be more susceptible to lung infections. Marijuana and tobacco and oxycotin do not build their businesses on the occasional user they could care less about the person who uses a couple times a year. They want the addict they need the addict to keep their business going. All the liquor stores, not everybody who drinks is an alcoholic and not everybody who smokes pot going to be addicted to it but the liqour stores only need 15% of heavy drinkers to keep their businesses going so the answer a lot of the time is money. And that's why in Denver right now there's a more pot shops then McDonald's, Starbucks and 7-Eleven combined there's over 900 of these things and that's just in the Denver area No one should be exposed to second marijuana smoke so you gotta watch who else is in here. Are there young people who are around the older people or smoking or vaping, we'll get into vaping, do to the risk it poses to lung health. ALA strongly cautions the public against smoking marijuana as well as tabacco products. More research is needed into the effects of marijuana on health especially lung health. Medical marijuana should be subjected to the same FDA standards of efficacy and safety as any pharmaceutical agent promoted for purposes of alleviating the symptoms of disease. ALA supports research into health effects of marijuana use including the risks and any potential benefits of medical marijuana. See here's the thing if you have, if you have a chance I know all you have your cellphones here. Think about cell phones how these things have evolved how communication's eveolved. I remember when we used to have a phone on the side of the wall in our living room that had one of those cords to it and anyway we could pick up that phone and we could say, get off the phone I'm on the phone! Now these little things are raising our children this is the stuff that everybody gets their information from this is the new way of communication. All of the advances that we're making they're not bad just different we have to rein them in, let people know what is really a valid and reliable source. Cause if you hit up smoking marijuana you're going to have over 11 million hits. How can somebody actually get to an AMA white paper or an ALA white paper or white papers when they're going through that tidal wave of information that's just inundated with them. By the way here's all the references that I have from that last slide, everything that I say unless I practiced it with my personal experience is coming off of something that's research. You're not gonna find that with the emotional chat that you get from a from pro-marijuana people it's always my experience where I know somebody. Medical marijuana card, oh boy, this is mine it's an insulting joke I was talking to a physician in Denver and she said it's an insulting joke on the medical industry When you can take somebody's something that, this is something we need to capture back. The people in the medical profession in my mind are arguably the most intelligent people in the world but they're not very vocal and so when somebody is trying to sell something and they hijack the name and they throw it on something that they're trying to promote and they use this to fool a lot of people. It's insulting to the people who have earned this designation as a medical provider. You know I go in to a pot shop in Colorado and I'm looking around and the guy says hey can I help you? And I say well I just want to really get high what do you have for me and so he goes through all kinds of different kinds of highs and so I was going around and I say well you know my family wants to get high with me and we're going to go up to the mountains what do you suggest well here you go, he takes me to another area starts showing me stuff and I say well my dog, he's part of my family, I want my dog to feel like we do Wow he starts showing me some edibles. He did say we don't really recommend it for animals because you see you can't prescribe this. This is not a prescribable medication Anybody can recommend and that's what they fall on the little word changes little play on words here. So this guy didn't ask if I had any kind of issues with my pulmonary system he didn't ask if I had any mental health issues he was just trying to sell me something but in doing that he didn't ask about the age of my kids he didn't ask about just anything that a physician or medical provider would ask He even was suggesting that I take something for my dog that's where I drew the line. Don't mess with my dog. So what do you need to do to write a prescription for amoxicillin? You need to diagonals the person, you need their history, you need a physical, you need to review their system then you have to decided what you're going to, for how long you're going to give them, the number of milligrams, number refills, dosing diagnosis, risk assessment What do you say to this person this is how ridiculous this whole thing's getting, you take 2 joints a day inhale like this. Are you going to show them how to inhale deep. I want you to take this strain and hope this strain is still available. And I hope it's not been fertilized with too many toxins. So this is for the NRS registry identification cards so the division shall establish and maintain this in Nevada Nevada revised statutes The division shall establish and maintain a program for the issuance of registry identification cards to persons who meet the requirements of this section. So without a written documentation from the persons attending physician. So you know what's interesting when the young people are going to get their their cards they're not going to their family physician. Surprise. Where they going? they're going to that rubber stamp doc in the box who is making sixty dollars every time he stamps a card and doesn't even see the patient a lot of the time. The person has been diagnosed with a chronic or debilitating medical condition. Average age for pot that's in the 20's and 30's do they really have chronic debilitating medical conditions? The medical use of marijuana may mitigate the symptoms or effects of that condition and the attending physician has explained the possible risks and benefits of the medical use of marijuana. Here's the deal, so Nevada law, Approved Conditions for Medical Marijuana AIDS well we've had that it's called marinol it's THC It's already available through the FDA it's regulated it's monitored it's for the AIDS scare that we had about 25 years ago. So it's available So if somebody has AIDS and they want their medical marijuana okay well try marinol. Cancer so you're introducing a carcinogen to help cancer. Glaucoma instead of taking eye drops to help that person with the high blood pressure you're saying I want you to smoke grandma instead of taking these eye drops a couple times a day I want you to smoke marijuana every few hours because marijuana's half life is relatively short so I want you to continue to smoke around the clock. Hey it's three o'clock in the morning get up! You need to take a couple puffs to help your glaucoma. PTSD we already talked about that. Seizures we'll get into that and the muscle spasms, cachexia, severe pain uh additional conditions subject to approval by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health This is some basic recommending recommendations saying is there documentation that the patient has failed on all other conventional medications to treat his or her ailment? Have you counsel the patient documented by the patients signed informed consent regarding the medical risks of the use of marijuana at a minimum to include infection, pulmonary complications, suppression of immunity, impairment of driving skills and the habituation? Has the patient misused marijuana or other psychoactive and addictive drugs? Do you periodically provide drug testing? When I'm talking about this and opioids people are drug-testing you're prescribing, say for opioids, you're prescribing it so you take the example of the person who gets his 90 opioid pills at the end of the month every month comes in consistently week after or month after month after month for a couple years. You do do a drug test and you find out there's no opiods in that persons system. It's kind of odd to have somebody come in and get the same prescription consistently cause in opioids the only answer is more. The only way to get feeling better with that regimen of medication is more. Same with the THC with marijuana so you want to make sure that your drug testing you want to make sure that you've reviewed exactly which patient should be allowed to use the drug medicinally and for how long. So for how long, this comes with all medication, whenever they're narcotics think what does success looks like and let's define how long we're going to do this. When you have a contract with the patient and you say you know after you take this for a certain amount of time you should be feeling this. If you're not feeling it we have to change your regimen and we're looking forward to getting you off of this, uh,  in a relatively short amount of time we're going to use it as a tool and we're not going to shy away from helping people were not into torture but we want to use it as a tool and we're going to make sure that they, that they get the best therapeutic optimal care that's possible. I'm going going to do an aside. Methadone clinics when I asked somebody about well what's your exit strategy? Oh they got me on this for 5 years Okay that's an interesting exit strategy Do you carefully examine and consistently follow up with the patients who smoke marijuana as a medical treatment including pulmonary function testing? Yeah you're introducing a pulmonary function issue now that you have to monitor and we want to make sure that there's no superadded infections especially with the fertilizers and pesticides and all the chemicals that are used to make the plants grow as fast as they do. Now they've got this down to a science. So when you go into a grow they have different lights that are using an awful lot of energy actually they did a study they found that 1,200 grow houses in Denver we're using as much energy as 35,000 homes. We're also looking, and that's keeping the fans going keep the lights going and then we're also looking at a ton of water this weed takes a ton of water. Have you exercise due care in asssuring the standardization of the tetrahydrocannabinol potency content of marijuana to be considered for the medicinal use and whether it's free of microbial contaminants? Becasue marijuana is a federally controlled substance; have you set up a system that's established in the state to track all patients? Cause right now it's federally illegal which means that the pot shops is a cash business. They can't put the money in a bank that's federally, uh, because the banks borrow money from the federal reserve bank. It's not really in pharmacies can you imagine 900 pharmacies in this area? Go to walmart and get your pot well which strain are you getting that's the first thing that I always ask when somebody says a wonderful thing about pot. Okay I believe it it gets you high, but what strain are you using? And then keeping that strain consistent. Now if it goes into a schedule two here's something the federal government is going to be regulating it when the federal government regulates it you're going to see a lot of pot shops that are starting to they're going to have to wither and fold because they're not going to be able to be non-regulated anymore. And the regulation that the state is doing you can see by the growth the explosive growth that it's not very effective. Have you shown knowledge, training, or certification in addiction medicine? Do you have demonstrable knowledge of the physiologic effects of marijuana, its side effects, and the interactions with other drugs before prescribing it? Then we have the interactions. Edibles. Here's the thing with edibles you start with 10 milligram that's what they say is the beginner dose. That's about a tenth of a candy bar or sixth of a cookie. Nobody really eats that. They eat the whole thing but the problem is it takes 20 to 40 minutes to hit, to hit them and with different types of marijuana you're having different impacts in potency and different impacts in the time that it takes to reach that effect. Here's another thing when the edible is eaten and it's metabolized through the liver. The liver adds 11 hydroxy to the delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol that's detected in the screening tools up to five weeks after ingestion. So if you go over your DOT exam they're checking for marijuana. Somebody was asking about what's the what's the cutoff rate so I was, I was trying to look that up but I'll tell you what folks that is that's a real complicated issue if you get pulled over by the cops and you have marijuana in your system that it is complicated and I don't feel confident in giving you a number I'll put an asterisk by this I heard 2 nanograms in the system and that's that's about what I got but you can't be relient on that you don't know when it's going to hit how long it's gonna stay in the system or what the impacts gonna be. All you know is that if you get caught or if you don't have any kind of clearance and it's in your system it's illegal. If you get caught in an accident and you have that in your system that's going to be blamed. Here's another thing with edibles with pot if you get too high you can always put it out, with metabolism you can't stop it and neither can your animals this is the most responsible group when eating does this look like they'd be, that a kid would like this or an animal would be attracted to this type of marketing. This is what's going out right now these are edible currently being sold Well if they're out there and your dog eats it, watch the veterinarian visits. If you have any friends in Colorado I urge you to talk to your ER doctors I urge you to talk to your veterinarian friends out there.They're going to let you know what's going on I have some horror stories about dogs eating peoples pot and the uncontrollable shakes the whimpering the lose of their legs the inability to move around and this goes on for hours and hours because they're not set up to ingest all of all of the THC that's available and that's what's being sold is the THC. Dabs okay what's happening is the isolation of CBD from THC isn't to take the CBD and give it to that kid who has seizures it's not to help the person who had chronic pain. It's to get that away from the plant so that the person can get more high. This is a perfect example of this this is THC at its best, we're looking at ninety percent THC. What do you think's going into the vape pens folks? When you see those blasts of vapor that, this is the perfect tool for them because they say you can identify it. Here's the problem if somebody smokes a cigarette we can smell the smoke and get away when those vape pens are coming around you cannot you don't even see it a lot of the time but its leaving a micro film on everything that it touched. If you could see these big clouds of smoke going all over that you can't smell and you can't detect after they vaporize that's leaving a film that you can touch and you can get into your system Dabs looks like kind of ear wax. This is the stuff that is filling up the emergency rooms down in Colorado when somebody's shaking screaming, kicking, has that sock over their face so that they're not spitting it's because of this stuff. Looks pretty innocent looks like jelly or peanut butter over at a carnival or fair all, this stuff comes at us innocently. There's your vape pen that's another thing that you're seeing on all kinds of the street corners right now. I'm going to go through these relatively quickly because I want to get to some of your questions. So what happened when Colorado with medical marijuana dispensaries you know today there's more medical marijuana shops then McDonald's, 7-eleven, Starbucks. Marinol dronabinol we've already talked about that that's synthetic. Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol indicated it's been out for over a few decades. Anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately, so this stuff's already available. Sativex, epidiolex this is an orphan drug for childhood epilepsy. Again when people here our veterans are hurting or little kids are hurting nobody's gonna want to see that person suffer nobody wants to see that person tortured Of course everybody is going to, or most people are going to want to help those people the issue is are we introducing them to more harm than good and by introducing this this type of chemical into their system. What's the dose these are the things to consider what dose do you give a person, what's the strain how does this specific strain impact the body? People are growing and harvesting their own marijuana what are they using to fertilize it? If you get a bad batch does your drug dealer come and contact you and say hey you know that last batch of donkey stuff well it seem's like it's a bad batch. I'm gonna have to ask you to come back in, we're doing to recall that. No other prescription medication is smoked Oh I wonder why. Concerns remain about the long-term risk of respiratory problems associated with smoking marijuana. FDA, AMA, ASAM SAMSHA, NIDA all say the same thing separate the compounds make the results  reproducible, research in controlled safe studies to determine benefit to risk, be standardized by identity, purity potency and quality, provide directions for use, include safe and reliable delivery systems. These are not unreasonable requests for a patient who's coming in to see the physician this is not an unreasonable request for a physician to request that he gets this from or she gets this from the pharmaceutical company or whoever's selling the stuff. Again not everybody who's going to smoke is going to become addicted but in US Canada and Australia it's estimated that 9% of people who try marijuana become dependent. In those beginning using the drug in their teens have approximately a one in six risk of developing marijuana dependence. I here I don't believe it! Marijuana is not addictive! How do you know it's not addictive? I smoke it everyday. Okay so marijuana is now the largest reason for treatment in adolescents, now that's in Nevada And when we're looking at marijuana use versus the perception of risk this is what it all is, society saying tobacco bad marijuana good and the younger people are buying this up. This is marijuana use among the 12th graders, this is the prime time to get somebody addicted. Again if you can get this person addicted now then you've got a customer for life and somebody who's just going to want more and more potency. New Zealand Study oh well, it doesn't impact my brain actually it helps me. Look up everybody get your phones, when you have another moment look up NIDA: Marijuana's lasting effects on the Brain this is 2,000 people in New Zealand, call it the New Zealand Study 1,000 people they had for their control group didn't smoke marijuana 1000 people were smokers for 25 years they tracked these guys ages 13 years to 38 years. The Marijuana smokers had 8 IQ points less than the nonsmoking base group. Now you can poke holes in all kinds of studies and I can see some flaws here but if we take the average IQ of 100 points and we say ok well they had 1,000 people and 8 points average that means 50% is less than even though your kid might be wonderful to you might be average IQ wise maybe. When we look at that gross margin 110 to 90 that's where a vast majority of the population is. In that 90 to 110 so can they afford to lose 100 points? Now you hear President Obama said that he smoked pot and Bill Gates said that he smoked pot Well if you have the support and staff that some politicians do and they dabbled in it 30 years ago where it's nowhere near what they're comparing it to today that that's false Or if you have an IQ of 150, like those little guys at the Davidson Academy it's freaking brilliant that's the stuff that we need to be concentrating on and promoting is more education better education. If we're providing something that will actually take away 8 points. My question is what about the kids that aren't that bright? What about the other 50%? What about that kid in their developmental stages who is impacting their brain negatively at this time with this product. Here it is Nevada Treatment Episode Data Set. Look at that 12 to 17 years this is treatment admissions in Nevada, this is us 43% that's more than your alcohol, heroin, other opioids, or meth. 18 to 20 years old you got 13%, 21 to 25 at 17%. Okay what do we got there? 20 60 almost 70% that's everybody going to treatment it's the young guys this is the target market area. Go down to 50 to 55 years you see 1% those are the guys who remember the good old days and those are the guys so are selling this stuff. So when we're looking at the sales techniques folks they're working and they're working right here Go to RMHIDTA.ORG you can find out some information from the president's office because we have somebody to compare it to These are the 11 criteria for cannabis use disorder that's the DSM 5, 2 to 3 of these will will put you in a mild substance abuse category, 4 to 5 is moderate and 6 or more are severe. And treatment works one of the things that I do when I'm working with especially a younger person is I ask them take yourself out five years give yourself five years. So if they're 17 years old now vision yourself as 22 and what do you look like, what accomplishments have you had and where are you in your life. Now you give yourself advise you let yourself know what you have to do to make those dreams come true. So when we get the patient actually working with themselves and moving towards the vision of their core honesty and they're and being consistent with their beliefs and values they know the answer as everybody else does. So when we're looking at this hold on to your reputation as medical professionals your're cherished and you're needed and take it very seriously when anybody tries to insult your name. With that if you know anybody who needs help please have them see me with treatment I usually only work with them for four weeks five weeks maximum and with that hope I have a little bit of time for questions. Does anybosy have any questions? And we do know that the hour is running short so if you do have to leave then no offense taken. I don't know what that was. Somebody else want to give it a shot? Anybody have any questions for Paul before we close it out for the day? If you do have questions please feel free to contact me if I can't answer them here I'd be happy to get back with you. We do have one form Dianne This one's not a question it's a thank you that was a very nice evidence-based presentation and very much appreciate it. Thank you very much Yes Paul is Dr. Sheldon thank you very much very informative. Appreciate it, thank you You know I didn't hit record on the video is there a way to get another copy of this if I need it? Yeah we do record it on our end, we're in transition on where we posted them but we usually make them publicly available Ok how about just the slides? Slides are online on our website. Okay. If you google Echo Nevada go to clinics and then it will be under the special series clinic Very easy to find, or I can email it to you if you like. Okay that would be great this is my first time using this program so I have to get a little more familiar with it, again thank you Paul, very very good. My pleasure thank you. Can I get your email before you go off? Sure I'll put it on the little chat here Perfect Thank you very much everybody."}
