{"m-fQPXKMt84": "[Music] natalie side surf here of sidesurf cake studio and i'm going to show you how i made a garlic cake for this cake i challenged myself to make it within two hours now i know that sounds like a lot of time but really it's not i used wafer paper on this cake and you have to let it dry and it takes time so i actually pulled off a pretty difficult challenge if you like this cake can you do me a favor and like this video just that little click really really helps us reach more people and if you haven't subscribed to our channel yet do it now we put out new cake videos every monday so let's get started here i have real garlic that i will use not only as a reference while making this cake but also as a mold to create a vanilla wafer paper garlic skin i used a small circle cutter to cut out a round layer of red velvet cake then i cut that layer in half so i have two tiny layers and i'm spreading some chocolate buttercream and i sandwich the cake layers back together now that my mini cake is stacked i place it next to the real garlic and i carve the cake with a small serrated knife i shape the cake with one pointed end and one heavier end similar to the shape of the garlic then i crumb coat the cake in a layer of chocolate buttercream it is so small that it's kind of awkward to spread the buttercream but with a little finesse you can make it happen [Music] once the cake is covered i spread a little cornstarch on a non-stick mat and i roll out a very very thin layer of white modeling chocolate then i place it onto the cake and i work it around into that garlic shape with a sculpting tool i blend the chocolate a little bit there's really no reason to take your time with it and cover it and make sure that everything is blended perfectly because it's just going to get covered with a final layer of wafer paper later speaking of wafer paper it's time to start working on it i cut out a square of vanilla wafer paper and i wet it on both sides using water and a mop brush then i gently pick it up i place it right onto the real garlic and i pick up the edges of the wafer paper and i'm trying my best to smooth out any wrinkles i have to be very gentle while working with wafer paper because it can easily tear when it's wet and it cracks when it's dry [Music] one hour later once the wafer paper is dry i start to work it off the garlic i found out by experimenting with wafer paper over the years that sometimes the paper will pop right off and then sometimes you got to work on it a bit the shape of the garlic has those clove sections so it's not a perfectly smooth surface and it can be a little tricky to work that wafer paper off the garlic but it looks really great once you get it now that the wafer paper is peeled off the real garlic it's time to work on the top of the cake which is the stem of the garlic i place a ball of modeling chocolate onto the top then i blend it in and i add texture to look like the stem of the real garlic [Music] you can use a pointed tool to create this texture just make sure you keep it random we want it to look natural and very real i even pressed little ripped pieces of wafer paper into the chocolate so that it looks like it's previous layers of wafer paper that were peeled away to add some color to the stem i used ivory and white food color and i let it seep into the texture it will help create these nice darker shadows and to complete the stem i brushed on some powdered sugar i love the matte powdered sugar effect that it gives the stem with an extremely thin brush i paint thin brown lines on the garlic skin that radiate out from the stem to do this you don't want to use water to dilute your food color but a strong alcohol or a clear extract water will make the wafer paper start to shrivel up but the alcohol doesn't because it evaporates so quickly now that the brown tones are on the skin i add a few areas that have purple tones you can see the purple in the real garlic so i want to include it plus it's pretty there are a ton of brown tones in nature so when you come across something that has some purple in it you want to include it it's a fun color and there you have it a garlic bulb cake if you like this video don't forget to leave a like and subscribe for a new video every monday all right it's time to cut the cake oh it really smooshed huh [Music] [Music]

This is Sherry, today we will make a garlic butter bread Garlic, butter and parsley mixed together There is a tempting salty aroma after baking Fluffy and moist bread with mozzarella cheese Who can resist such a delicious temptation! If you like my cooking video, please remember to like it\ud83d\udc4d and subscribe to my channel! Add 102g cold milk, 34g cold whole egg 102g cold water, Leave 10% to adjust the softness of the dough The water temperature is about 10-15\u00b0C in winter and 3\u00b0C in summer Add 340g bread flour 6.5g salt, 4g milk powder, 28g caster sugar Stir with low speed 2nd gear Adjust the amount of water appropriately according to the water absorption of your flour When there is no dry flour, add 3.5g instant yeast Continue to mix for about 30 seconds at speed 2, it doesn\u2019t need to knead evenly The mixed dough is soft but not sticky Put the dough in the refrigerator to chill for 20 minutes (if the room temperature is below 20 degrees in winter, you don\u2019t need to refrigerate) The dough of this bread is colder, it is easier to knead out gluten Turn to medium speed 4 and knead until the dough is smoother. It takes about 3 minutes When the dough can be stretched into a malleable, not very smooth windowpane, butter can be added Add 34g of softened unsalted butter Rip the dough into small pieces for easy mixing with butter Turn on low speed 2 and stir until you can't see the butter in the dough. It takes about 3 minutes Turn to medium speed 4 and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, it takes about 6-7 minutes The kneaded dough be easy to pull out a translucent membrane, and there are almost no jagged edges around the hole Fold the dough smoothly Put it in a bowl, cover and ferment to double size. It takes about 60-90 minutes at 26C Poke a hole in the dough with your fingers, and the fermented dough will not shrink or collapse Divide the dough into 16 equal parts, each about 40g Shape the dough into a round ball Rest for 20-30 minutes Roll out the rested dough into a rectangle Flip over the dough and roll it up from top to bottom Rest for 5 minutes Roll into a 30cm long strip with thin ends and thick middle Use two pieces of dough and twist them into a 2 strand braid Cover and proof until double size. It takes about 45-55 minutes at a temperature of 28-30\u00b0C While waiting for the final proof, prepare the garlic butter paste 50g softened unsalted butter, 1g salt, 25g minced garlic, 3g Italian parsley It tastes better if the garlic and the parsley is finely minced Mix the ingredients well Put it in a sandwich bag (or piping bag) Cut a hole about 1cm in diameter and set aside Evenly brush with whole egg wash Squeeze the garlic paste Sprinkle some mozzarella cheese Bake in the middle layer of the oven preheated to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C for 10-12 minutes until the surface is golden After being baked, put it on a rack to cool, serve in warm The bread is very soft and moist, and the garlic butter aroma is very delicious.

e's joint grab they put some money in my account after a while that's what happens with these if you don't order they throw like 20 bucks in there trying to tempt you back so i made the best use of it that i could and just bought a bunch of js so this is one of them and this is the ease house brand as far as i can tell anyway um a little while ago a bunch of this circle stuff just started popping up on ease never seen it anywhere else so i assume it's their one of their house offerings but uh yeah let's go ahead and just jump into this and see what's good so we've got circles there indica and it looks like this down here is gonna be the testing information so let's take a look alright so yeah something i did notice i didn't see it here before but uh circles dash loud pack so this is another loud pack uh effort uh they are it's like they've had their tentacles and everything you can buy different products with different names and then you look closer and you'll see powered by lab pack on there so um let's see so that's just i thought that was the testing info but i guess not so let's take a look around here so there's birthday cake here's some cultivation info 523 so a little older at this point um this is nine dollars out the no not out the door pre-tax so this is nine dollars pre-tax just skating in under uh under that ten dollar mark but not after tax unfortunately and the batch they're easy so kind of makes me feel like that that this is an ease effort a an ease loud pack effort because as you can see they're powered by loud pack birthday cake and so at this point we're looking at about seven months old well a little bit before that six to seven six and a half months more or less so yeah not too great there's the government warning they're always watching so we'll see how this holds up this is on the cheaper side 1g as you can see there um but yeah i'm not exactly sure what to expect oh there's the thc info testing out at 13.345 they went for that extra decimal place instead of just putting 13.35 on there but um yeah that's i mean that's low thc doesn't mean everything but it does mean something a little bit of cbd in there too so so yeah i assume this is probably greenhouse at best maybe outdoor so let's check it out together and see what's good here with the circles so yeah i think this is supposed to be a more affordable j for for the ease customer so i believe they're trying to get into the whole vertical integration thing um you know or get that going so good luck to them if that is the case this that i was just smelling the tube it smells like i don't know it smells like stew kind of like beef stew that's weird i never really smelled the tubes though so i won't comment on that let's do a quick crutch check here and see what's good uh so i can already see before i mess with this that there is some kind of wrinkle here so i'm guessing you guys go you can see it that probably that's the point where the crutch is weak and it looks like yeah pretty much the case so i'm guessing these are all machine packed and it's probably very tight fairly tight up here and looser as you go down so yeah i'm not sure what the tech used is probably just a knock box or something like that but whatever it was they didn't take care to pack the bottom first and then you know drop in the rest because yeah it's hard when you're mass filling j's you got to go with that it's like time is of the essence you know and this is probably fairly cheap material so yeah i mean it's to be expected with something in the said subtitle or price point i'm not trying to hate and here we go clipping our way down to the crutch taking a moment of zen a deep breath exhale and that's the end of the j and there we go so that's the material inside yeah not looking stellar i mean nothing out of the ordinary though for a sub 10 j pre-tax um i mean right off the bat i can say i wouldn't be like stoked and there's it seems kind of sloppy too because you can see there's [ __ ] in the crutch there some i don't know yeah it's again i can't be too critical because it is very cheap or it's attempting to be cheap it's not that cheap considering that you could go to jungle boys you'd have to drive there you couldn't get it delivered and if you have your medical card you get a j that's usually over packed and weigh generally or generously for uh like 16 bucks out the door so for six more dollars you could be getting you know like a g and a half of nice indoor not guaranteed you'd still get a g guaranteed but uh but yeah just from what i've seen so anyway enough about that let's talk about this joint as you can see there's already a passenger hanging out there plain as day don't even have to go dig in trying to get a zoom in there on it there we go so yeah there he is didn't even have to get my pickaxe out didn't have to [ __ ] spend a lot of time we already find a fairly major first offender but again this is probably greenhouse at best so imagine that it's filled with that and that's probably just a bigger piece but you know this stuff looks really ground down not as finely ground is a lot of other stuff so i guess i can't hate but as i run my fingers through you can definitely pick up here's another one right there pick up on a few stems here and there my fingers are fairly keefed up though so maybe the material wasn't too bad um i'm gonna go ahead and set this back down you guys can take a look see if you see anything while i get a sniff on these grinds and then we'll go for the way and see what's up does have like a kind of pleasant freshness of mint i would say there but uh not really picking up on a lot of other smells i didn't do a dry pool my bad i should have but yeah that's pretty much it's like a musty mint but more minty than must maybe a slight hint of sweetness in there but nothing fantastic not super gross uh it doesn't look as bad as i would say the material looks but nothing really potent nothing to write home about basically par for the course when you're looking at a j of this uh price range so anyway let's go ahead and get this scale going kind of clean up this area so we can do that all right turn this bad boy on i got stickers all over the place now there's one stuck to my freaking hand all right let me get that off there all right so here we go moving you guys over to the scale so you can get a better view on that there it is all right can you see it not exactly let me adjust here there we go let's zoom out just a little bit here and there is a good view on it so let's go ahead and get this going zero that out still not zeroed there we go and i'll put my sticker there just for fun and here we go let's see so if this comes up to point nine or more it's accurate on the way material is not super stellar but whatever you know it is what it is when you're playing in that sub 10 range coming out to a g exactly 0.9 rolling back so yeah it's a g i mean there's a little dust left on the paper but i'm gonna give it to him whatever it's uh it is what it is so i mean if you come across this and you like it you know for the price point then fine go for it i've probably saved my pennies i may go to jungle boys like i was saying earlier or just find another j that's of a little higher quality for sure indoor i mean even at catalyst like fresh baked js or 18 bucks so it's like you're not really saving a whole lot when you consider tax what you are saving is a trip to the store though so maybe that's worth the convenience but that's what's inside circles you get a technical pass but i would say i'd give this if i had to letter grade it which i've been doing weirdly on the japanese grading scale this gets like a b maybe um definitely nowhere near s rank but it passes so there you go", "w7An6nWb-PI": "I think it's pretty unanimous that garlic is the goat of all seasonings and I know that we're gonna get that one person that's like oh and that's okay but let me show you something really quick here's a nice little cross-section of garlic it's great brings a tear to my eye childhood memories all that good stuff but there's another life changing side the garlic that you might not have ever seen before and I'm not talking roasted garlic toasted garlic that rhymes I'm talking black garlic okay so it's fermentation Friday but I have some bad news this is not a permit I don't even know why I'm putting it on fermentation Friday it's a commonly mistaken as a fermented product but it is totally not because the enzymatic process that's going on is actually the my yard reaction which if you don't know what that is I'll put a link in the description describing what it is because it's gonna take me way too long to describe it all it takes like the spicy sharp garlic into like a very mellow caramelized almost smoky just brown sugar tamarind like all these like rich sweet flavors with like a nice umami background like this is literally a flavor explosive bomb of deliciousness I'll get off my soapbox and let's make this shall we all right now black garlic is insanely easy all you need is the right equipment and requires almost no active effort so you have three different choices here that's right you got options my number one choice which is the route that I went was my Sahara dehydrator which will be linked below the second option would be a typical rice cooker you know like the one that cooks rice and the third option would be my fermentation station all of which will be in the links below now I chose to go with the dehydrator just because of the accuracy and even distribution of temperature but unfortunately you cannot use your oven for this though now for the easiest part so first thing you need is well garlic whole fresh bulbs of course Ivor I would recommend doing a lot of them or at least as many as you can fit in whatever device you're using I think I did something like 12 total bulbs then you're going to individually wrap these babies tightly in plastic wrap and then tightly in two layers of foil think of it kind of like a little tinfoil hat for your garlic except instead of shielding it from electromagnetic fields you're keeping it from drying out or you know all the good stuff cool that's pretty much all the effort you're gonna need to put in here that's right now if you're doing this in the Sahara dehydrator you'll just place the garlic in a metal or heat proof container that will hold all of them I use the shallow half Hotel pan which I did not steal from the restaurant that I used to work at link in the description and then place it in the bottom of the dehydrator and set it to sixty degrees Celsius or a hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit then just close those doors and literally just let it go for four to eight weeks that's it and don't forget to reset the dehydrators timer every 99 hours I know it's a while but it's literally just sitting there so I mean just live your life now if you're doing this in a rice cooker it's the exact same method except what you're gonna do is place some sort of small grate in the bottom to keep your garlic from touching the actual bottom of the rice cooker then just place your wrapped garlic in the rice cooker and set it to the keep warm function with the lid on now my understanding is that the rice cooker may run a little warmer so check your garlic after three weeks now as for the fermentation station you'll do the exact same thing except you'll place the wrapped cloves in a little pot then place a lid on of course instead of the exact same temperature of 60 Celsius or 140 degrees Fahrenheit and for just about the same amount of time and guess what that's it there's nothing special that you need to do to the garlic just let it do its thing and live your life sure it takes kind of a while but it's only five to ten minutes of active time to get started now just a reminder once your gerlichs done just pull it on let it sit at room temperature for about a day just to redistribute its moisture and then store it in the fridge just make sure not to pull the garlic out until it's completely black not dark brown but totally pitch black like midnight so it's essentially a very slowly cooked and very slowly browned aged garlic that's essentially what's going on here now let's talk about how to use this stuff think of it as a way to add sweet rich umami to just about anything there are no wrong answers here some people even add it to ice cream and I can attest it's quite good now this stuff is super soft so you can easily just mash it or spread it on something like toast but I'm looking for something just a little more refined now if you followed me on Instagram which by the way if you don't be sure to click the link below and you know hit me up then you might have seen my black garlic bonito butter yeah the most amazing compound butter of all time it's actually insanely easy to make once you have the black garlic so you're literally just gonna take 3 tablespoons or 1 gram of bonito flakes and then just sort of roughly chop that just that it's not so big little pieces are good then do the same thing to 1 to 2 heads of black garlic that's obviously been peeled you can do as much as you want I only did one head but you can totally do too and it will still be amazing and then just add that to half a pound or 227 grams of unsalted butter that is totally room-temperature and softened then just mix all that together lay down a nice sheet of plastic wrap and scrape out your butter onto the plastic wrap and slowly rotate the plastic wrap around it sort of create a sausage shape grab the ends and make sure that there's no seen by the way because you don't want this to spread out of the side when you're doing this grab both ends and then basically roll that sort of sausage shape against your counter over and over and you'll notice it's start to get tighter and tighter and tighter until you get a nice little tight you know sausage shape tie off those ends and then place it in the refrigerator until totally firm and solid and if you don't know what to do with the compound butter like this I mean you can do anything that you would use get butter for but my personal choice would be to put a nice thick with to seize coin on a beautifully seared steak and then just let that melt over the steak and just go to town go to town on that home another thing we can do is make an amazing black garlic chimichurri now in order to do that you're gonna roughly mince a single Fresno chili and then finely chop a whole bunch of parsley like an entire individual Bunch I mean I used Italian parsley the zest and juice from 2 lemons and then two heads of black garlic finely chopped then just add enough olive oil to cover all of that in a bowl and mix it together season it generously with salt and you've got an amazing black garlic chimichurri they get spoon over a nice steak or some roasted chicken or potatoes or literally anything that you want to taste delicious also blend it up a little marinade with one head of peeled black garlic 1/4 cup or 60 8 grams of barley miso 2 tablespoons or 14 grams of olive oil a splash of mere and a splash of rice vinegar a little bit of salt you know something just kind of like thrown together blended it up and then pour it on some Wagyu short ribs and marinated them and it was delightful you get the point here black garlic can replace anything that uses roasted garlic or fresh garlic or whatever you want to add the most amazing Amami explosion of your life but do you want to know what else has an umami explosion b-roll [Music] because we're gonna do her helps you in just a moment but I gotta commandeer this just for a second that song you just heard was a custom-made song for us by my boy Sam aka Prince Fox he will be in the description Eden as song is titled hit him with the b-roll so you know anyway alright guys and that is it black garlic we done did it now the Sun is starting to go down so I only have a few minutes before this goes completely dark in here I hope you guys actually try this because it was it's really honestly easy it just takes it just takes a bunch of inactive time you're just literally putting it somewhere and then letting it sit to me this is something that a lot of people can do and you get to experience a really cool process that may lead to a bunch of other interests within cooking and food and blah blah it doesn't really require any skill at all unless you have unless you struggle like wrapping foil around stuff in which case then you might struggle with this recipe I know people are gonna ask about the garlic smells so if you watched at this point thank you you get to reap the benefits of that it's not that bad honestly the first like week you can definitely smell it but like it's really not that obvious at least in my opinion and then after that like it's slowly diminishes to the point where like you can't even smell it like it's really not that bad and if you wrap the garlic well enough like it won't release that much smell so just make sure you grab the garlic nicely and you're good that's it for today so [Applause] that was nice nice look I might say so right now I'm actually working on some work ideas so if you guys want to leave a comment and ask for anything specific please do it now while I'm developing stuff if you like pictures and sneak peeks and all that jazz and you want to DM me I try to respond to as many people as I can then be sure to click

crops to grow certainly one of the easiest fall crops to grow is garlic i've grown garlic for 10 straight seasons now from the same stock i originally planted a decade ago the trick to growing garlic successfully is in understanding its life cycle once you grasp its basic needs to complete this the planting growing maintenance and harvest of garlic is actually quite simple so today let me show you how to grow the most successful garlic you've ever grown regardless of where you live or what you're growing in and it starts right [Music] now [Music] the path to a successful crop of garlic is based on preparation both the preparation of the garlic itself as well as the pot container or bed that you're going to be growing in let's start with the easy one and prep the garlic prepping the garlic is so easy it's 95 ready to plant already so i know for many of you that have done this a thousand times before this part is going to be a little bit redundant but if you've never grown garlic it's important to know the life cycle of the garlic next year's garlic crop is grown by taking the cloves from this year's bulb and overwintering them fully planted each clove of garlic has everything it needs to grow into a full bulb of six to 14 new cloves for next summer our job is to simply remove the outer layer of paper only this paper layer is what essentially holds the bulb together once we remove that outer paper sheath we can then separate the individual cloves for planting it's important to note here that the garlic cloves themselves also have a paper coating don't remove this leave that layer intact it's pretty easy stuff and most bulbs will give you around eight individual cloves let's go ahead and zip through another one so you can see it again this one seems a bit smaller with a few less cloves same process though try not to force the garlic apart too much if one clove feels really stuck move around the bulb and find one that's easier eventually they're all going to come loose this bulb only had six cloves albeit nice plump ones pretty easy stuff right so with the garlic prep let's go ahead and set up the area with which we're going to grow it i grow garlic in both containers and raised beds and each is done a little bit differently so let's go ahead and look at container garlic first garlic isn't too picky about container size it's all about the spacing anything that drains well and is at least six inches deep is perfectly fine i love to grill my garlic in four foot herb planters so i'm first gonna grab a few off the wall for our planting these planters are just built for garlic and having about 40 inches of growing space lengthwise means i can get about 10 plants in each i line them with newspaper for every new planting to help prevent the soil from spilling out the bottom it's great because it lets the water through but not the soil perfect for container garlic i plant them a bit in reverse by first filling them with two to three inches of fresh compost you can put your compost on top no problem at all but i find it works better as a base with your premium potting mix on top the soil that we're going to be using to fill all of our garlic containers with is the same soil that we're going to be using to plant out the garlic beds so now is a perfect time to talk about it you can buy your own potting container mix from the store and it'll work perfectly fine i make my own and i'll throw a link to that in the description below essentially garlic needs a loose light well-drained ph neutral soil mix so if you can make that yourself great if you have to buy it well that's great too there is one thing that i do extra however and that is i add about five percent sand garlic really likes good drainage so adding a few cups of sand to your mix is highly recommended mix it all up nicely and we're ready to plant the best way to plant container garlic is to simply fill your container all the way to the top and then take each clove and push them down spaced accordingly if you're using the right soil mixture this should be a cinch potting and container soil mixes are a dream to work with because they're so light filling up your planter boxes takes no time at all and even less effort i will say though that it's a good thing that garlic is quite shallow rooted and that we can use such low planters otherwise feeling these guys could get quite expensive another good way to save a few dinars is to check out the video where i explain how to reuse spent potting soil perfect scenario with our container garlic when the planters are full you're going to want to compress them down about 20 percent to really pack that soil mix in go ahead and add a little more mix after to bring that level back up again garlic cloves have a top and a bottom to them the roots come out the bottom obviously but unlike most seeds garlic bulbs have difficulty reorienting themselves after planting so ensure that you're planting them root and down now with your garlic ends root and down simply bury them in that soil mixture about an inch deep space them three to four inches apart and work your way down your preferred containers really ensure that those tips are buried the shoots are gonna find their way to the surface no problem don't worry so as you can see the actual planting of these guys is lightning fast it's all predicated on the preparation the same thing goes with the raised beds which we'll see in a minute but everything you do to set these guys up is what makes the planting so easy now i've got 32 more of these guys to do i'm going to go ahead do those right now and then we can talk about the final steps of setting these guys up for the long winter actually before we do that let me show you what it would look like if we potted up the garlic in a regular pot or container like this same thing using a pot fill it up all the way compress it down to pack the soil in and then top it off with round pots like this i work my way around the circumference and space the garlic about three to four inches apart and you're going to want to keep it about two inches away from the sides of the pot it's probably a little bit tight but i'm gonna go ahead and squeeze one right in the center again make sure all the garlic clove tips are buried the final steps that we do when planting garlic in containers is much the same as any other crop that we do at the farm it's always mulching and watering but given the circumstances of time of year we're heading into winter very very quickly here and we're planting a brand new bulb that hasn't sprouted yet so this step is ultra important almost all the organic mulches work very well with garlic you can use straw grass clippings shredded leaves or combinations of all of them lay it on thick at least two inches this is going to be the garlic's blanket all winter long your mulch will help to mitigate the extreme temperature swings as well as to prevent moisture loss or the reverse too much moisture guys don't skimp here the mulch layer can be the difference between a good garlic crop and a great one give your planters a good soaking and you likely won't have to water again until the spring if you're pressed for space there's no reason that you couldn't easily grow hundreds of bulbs of the most epic organic garlic purely in containers alone go ahead and put the planters back in their permanent spot and wait for next summer's harvest it's just that easy this 10-foot wall of just four herb planters will house 40 bulbs of garlic and still be planted after summer harvest with fresh herbs for the rest of summer all right so planting and growing garlic in containers is pretty straightforward so let's move on to preparing an established raised bed or plot to grow some epic garlic the first step to growing garlic in raised beds whether you grow no-till style or not is unequivocally to clean and prepare the bed if you're observing no-till methods cut all weeds off right at the root collar and level the old mulch lightly with a hard rake end of summer cleaning is always the most labor intensive but the no dig method of gardening certainly mitigates that work so it's not the prettiest it never really is this time of year but now is when the magic happens with your beds all cleaned and prepped let's make our garlic rose spacing rules still apply three to four inches between each bulb and two to three inches from the sides if you're growing in a raised bed using that same potting mix simply lay down a two inch or more thick row if you have the space like i do here put in another row i do try to have about six to eight inches of space in between rows so keep that in mind lay them down right on top of that old mulch simply no need to dig here why make work for yourself when it's so unnecessary i'm doing an 8 foot bed and i usually get about 20 to 24 cloves in the center of each row pretty awesome use of space for a bed that would otherwise lie dormant all winter again plant your clothes root end down only now you see that i'm not really burying them this is where the plot or raised bed planting differs from the containers our two inch row of new soil isn't enough to bury these guys so for this step we're content with simply setting up the cloves with the correct orientation as before it goes really fast and an entire bed won't take but a few minutes now taking that same potting mix go ahead and bury the rose one to two inches deep is perfect i admit it is an extra step but doing it this way ensures that we can still observe no dig practices the time consumed is a little bit more but the labor involved is quite which really is the motto of no dig gardening extra care but not really extra work with the rows all done we can continue on the process as before and start mulching really lay it on nice and thick here trust me it'll serve your garlic well i cover the whole bed and not just the rose but if you're conserving mulch for whatever reason you can start with covering the rose first and then fill in the rest of the bed with whatever you have left as with the container garlic before finish off your planting with the watering to end all waterings really soak them good here awesome stuff i really love the winter garlic beds aesthetically and mentally it gives me that optimism that something is growing in there even in the dead of winter as you can see growing the best garlic is all based on preparation and timing speaking of time here's the two long didn't watch obligatory recap in 40 seconds prepare your garlic by peeling off the outer layer of paper only and then separating the individual cloves next prepare your container pot or raised bed to start planting the garlic using a neutral ph well-drained fairly loose potting mix garlic gets planted at least six weeks before your first fall frost date and about one to two inches below the soil surface space those cloves three to four inches apart to give them room to grow and make sure to mulch with your favorite loose organic mixture one good watering and your garlic is set for the coming winter and subsequent harvest next summer garlic really is a set it and forget it type of crop which is often what we need this time of year both for our bodies and our minds hey if you have any more garlic

buttermilk 100 milliliters of olive oil 3 x 1 or 2 cloves of garlic and sun-dried tomatoes so i started off by peeling the garlic and it helps when you push down on it a little bit like that and then you can peel it quite easily and then i started to cut that into very small pieces can't home next I took the tomatoes and this is about 75 grams of tomatoes and I just cut them into smaller pieces but you don't want them to be too small then I took the dry ingredients so the flour the salt and the baking powder and I mix that all together next I took the wet ingredients so the buttermilk the olive oil and a little bit of the oil that was with the tomatoes and this reacts and then I started mixing so mixing those who try another wet ingredients together because I wanted it to be nice and fluffy so I did that for a while and then I started adding the dry ingredients into that so this is the texture at the end then I added in the tomatoes and the garlic and I started mixing that in really really well that's but at least I put that into a cake tin and you want to bake that for 60 minutes with 160 degrees Celsius so really hope you enjoy this", "vTcwD9tSPNs": "I'm going to show you how to crush garlic by hand and all you need is a good large chopping knife you don't need a garlic crusher so I'm going to start with a whole bulb of garlic and the way you get your separate cloves from the bulb is to just give it a good squish with the weight your body and they should fall apart like that so that's really easy then we're going to take one of the cloves put it flat side down on the board and then using your knife and again using the weight of your body be careful not to touch the sharp side of the knife just on the flat edge squish down and crush it like that and that is the simplest way to take the skin from the clove so let's just peel those bits of paper you skin away here we go the next step is to give it a chop so chop it quite finely you haven't got to be too panicky to get how you do this once you've got it chopped roughly you can move your knife across and chop it a little bit finer and it's easiest if you use the heel of the knife which is this part do this job okay now what I'm going to do now is work it into a paste and the best tool to help me do this is some sea salt so I'm going to take quite a good pinch of salt sprinkle that on top if you don't have sea salt table salt is just as good and I'm going to use the flat of my knife I'm just going to scrape down pressing quite hard onto the work surface or chopping board go and again keep collecting the garlic back back into little pile scrape down again and after a few goes you should be left with a fairly smooth paste there we go there you have one very easily crushed garlic clove

disease is a serious condition and unfortunately many of these symptoms are silent until the later phases conditions like high blood pressure high cholesterol being overweight having a poor diet or even some genetics all do play a role but i am going to show you something today where there are dozens and dozens of clinical studies that show that garlic can resolve many of these conditions an increase in the ability of platelets to aggregate has been linked to the narrowing of blood vessels and the occurrence of acute thrombotic events the compounds in garlic have been found to inhibit platelet aggregation by downgrading the fibrogen binding activity which can inhibit and prevent blood clotting in the arteries when there's blockage of blood supply to the heart we call that a heart attack when there's blockage of blood supply to the brain we call that a stroke garlic is also known to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure the main compound in garlic called allicin prevents the production of angiotensin ii which is a compound responsible for increasing blood pressure by causing the blood vessels to tighten up and contract allicin also appears to increase the production of nitric oxide which helps dilate the blood vessels allowing more blood to flow through easier which helps lower your blood pressure garlic will improve your cholesterol levels excessive cholesterol causes plaquing in the arteries the compounds in garlic lower the bad cholesterol the ldls raise the good cholesterol the hdls as well as lowering triglycerides now this clove of garlic has many healing medicinal properties that can do wonders for cardiovascular disease in helping prevent atherosclerosis that clogging of the arteries to help lower blood pressure and to keep you healthy now you must crush or chop up this garlic and that's where we get the major biologically active component to help your cardiovascular system and to prevent the buildup of plaque in the arterial walls so after you chop your garlic up you must let it sit in the open air for about 10 minutes this is where allosan expands it grows at compounds this is where the magic lies in if you cannot eat the garlic raw because it's too strong maybe the sulfur smell take some lemon and squeeze it over that chopped garlic it will settle it down eat it raw if all possible if you can't put it in some water and drink it down add a little honey whatever it takes there's nothing like raw garlic and in the last resort if you need to saute that garlic do it on a lower heat and a shorter time because excessive heat will denature and affect the allicin in that garlic so eat that garlic clove every day and you will see within three to four weeks tremendous changes in your cardiovascular system please share this

we're gonna help Pizza the Hutt hold on your pepperonis [Applause] [Music] [Music] so this is but better episode three or four I think it's Episode four this is the series where we remake mass-manufactured fast foods but with classic cooking techniques with the intention to make them better browsing my comments and a lot of people were saying Josh please out Pizza the Hutt and I said you know what I'll do my best so that that's yeah that's a synopsis solo with that said let's do this shall we all right so we're gonna talk oh wait hold on I'm gonna taste both Domino's Pizza decide which is better and then compete only as three and a half stars on yo can I just do a medium pepperoni pizza Domino is your next buddy boy Jesus is that how much people eat just do a medium pepperoni pizza awesome cool thank you to the Domino's and the Pizza Hut guys show up at the same time and only wait a minute it took 25 minutes there hurry here Domino's gets the first pick no three oh they're doing like a garlic butter thing on the on the cross okay next okay so pizza friendly arrived it's real soft kind of spongy oh do you know what this doesn't taste good Domino's is the winner the wonderful screws okay it's a pizza time I'm sorry Italians so let's serve by making our dough now look if you want to really get though the flour choice matters double o tipo Italian flours what you want but all-purpose works in a pinch you need two and a half cups or 380 grams of that to that you're gonna add two teaspoons or 10 grams of sugar one during a quarter teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt and optionally half a teaspoon or one gram of diastatic malt powder I know it sounds fancy you can get it a lot of places just helps with color and flavor slip it around with wires attached to a metal stick until thoroughly incorporated okay so here we've got one cup or 245 grams of water at around 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius so then we're gonna have one and a half teaspoons or 5 grams of instant yeast mix that together and just let that sit for a couple of minutes until it starts to bubble a little now here's the best part of this recipe no machine required you can do this all by hand just pour all that liquid into your flour mixture mix it by hand to get a rough dough sort of looking like this dump it on your counter and then just start kneading it knead it for about 5 minutes until you get a roughly nice and smooth dough now will feel a little sticky at first but once you've kneaded it it should come together and not stick so bad if you just can't handle it you can always add a little sprinkling of extra flour but for the most part it needs to be pretty hydrated now once you've got a nice velvety smooth ball like this shape it into a slightly top ball by sliding around in circles on a counter keeping your fingers in contact with the counter so sort of tightening it up like that lightly grease a medium sized bowl with extra virgin olive oil toss your dough in there cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for about one to two hours at room temperature until thoroughly doubled or alternatively you can let it go overnight in the refrigerator now if you're doing it same day you need to start preheating your oven I'm gonna need this pizza stone obviously please attend to the upper third of your oven and preheat your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit for at least an hour before you bake any pizzas now let's talk about pizza sauce look unless you live in Italy I really recommend just getting the 28-ounce can of peeled san marzano tomatoes they're delicious and they're form Italy plus less prep now I tend to be a little particular about this I like to remove the seeds whenever I do this so you can like poke pop them open just rip out the seeds separate them and then run the juice to refine my strainer then I like to add two cloves of garlic 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of olive oil salt to taste in a large pinch of sugar then just blend that all together until nice and smooth and well that's it I mean if you want to cook it down and make a little thicker so it doesn't get too watery when baking you totally can but a lot of the time I don't and it's still wonderful now let's talk about that's funny to me now let's talk about pepperoni okay you can pick up whole pepperoni at your local grocery store hopefully I've strong preference to slicing my own you can get them way thicker and they get those nice sort of like cups those peppy cups oh yeah so that's the goods like to slice I'm just a little thicker than about a quarter of an inch okay so once your dough's reach plump boy hours you ready to shape before you do that you need to make a quick mixture of equal parts cornmeal and all-purpose flour I did like a half a cup and a half cup okay so once you're ready to prep your dough first realize that you should have brushed your plastic wrap with olive oil yeah it was a stupid mistake lightly this to work surface with your cornmeal flour mixture divide your dough into two evenly sized pieces and shape into medium top balls same way as we did before and place them on a generously dusted sheet tray you know with that flour my shirt you can cover with a lot of things actually just covered this with another sheet tray just beware as you saw before with the dough will stick to stuff and let them rest for at least 30 minutes now while that's resting let's go ahead and greet our cheese we'll need a total of three cups of grated cheese and I get equal parts of three different cheeses here we've got a nice smoked white cheddar a Monterey Jack and mozzarella you can use fresh mozzarella can use part-skim whichever one you prefer and then just grate those on a coarse grater and then toss them all together now if you're using fresh mozzarella I'd recommend cutting it into really small cubes now we need to make one more finishing touch you'll see how we'll use it but simply combine a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of extra-virgin olive oil a good one with three cloves of freshly grated garlic and a generous pinch of flaky salt mix until homogenised time to shape our pizza generously dust a work surface with your flour cornmeal mixture take one of your pieces of dough and place it on the work surface generously dust that and then just punch around the center to sort of create a very thin perimeter now trust me be careful your if you make the perimeter too thick it will puff up and you'll have a gigantic crust just drip the pizza over your hands and rotate it around letting gravity sort of stretch it carefully go slow if you need to don't make sure it doesn't tear get too thin well it starts to get too thin place it back down and just sort of stretch it out with roughly a 10 to 12 inch pizza place it on a pizza peel that it's also been generously dusted with your flour mixture give it a thin coating of your sauce then your cheese well half your cheese that is or well however much cheese you want I don't know your pepperoni evenly dispersed as you can and think carefully because this bit is hot slide it onto your ripping hot pizza stone and let it bake for about five minutes and then broil for an additional minute and you should come out with a beautiful pizza after you pull it out immediately brush just the crust also called the crusty with that beautiful garlic oil we made it just a second ago brushes generously don't be scared and let it cool a little slightly before you cut it and enjoy and just repeat with the other pizza Italians listen up I love you guys I don't think this is a representation of an Italian pizza we're battling Pizza Hut Domino's okay we're not battling the entire country of Italy so anyway I don't even need to have a conversation about this no pepperoni cups moist beat but also melt in your mouth at the same time the crust beautiful tear nice and chewy that garlic oil that's a spicy meatball whoa the ugliest pizza the prettiest mine okay this you can smell the tomato the garlic the spicy pepperoni that needless to say we definitely out Pizza the Hutt but I'm the winner it's me shooters gonna shoot winners gonna win baby but do you want to know what else is gonna out Pizza the Hutt [Music] [Applause] alright guys and that is it so we made pizza but not just any pizza we made a pizza to out pizza the Hut and Domino's I decided to throw Domino's into the mix because well to me it felt kind of weird to just do Pizza Hut and just do Domino's so I figured why not do both I think I honestly think that there were some negatives to my pizza I will say that for one I don't eat the bottom was as crispy as it should have been it was still kind of floppy which is a problem and the main reason for that is actually because it's very hard to get the stone hot enough if it weren't for the immense amount of flavor and beautiful appearance of the pizza I really think we might have almost lost simply because of that one factor for those of you who watched at the end I would like to treat you and by treating you by showing you the Hat for merch you ready ok I'm gonna go get it this is one of three pieces ok it's not just the Hat we're also gonna be doing an apron and we're also gonna be doing a shirt but I really like the Hat a lot so I decided I would show you you ready it's a cute little thing you don't get to hiked up all right come the hell down there it is ok look at that it's a little santoku a little Japanese santoku knife for those of you who watch to the end and you saw that that is my

gonna do our best every time ok you show up to the fight anyway goodbye have a wonderful day love you [Music] [Applause]", "CnD_zOq-rqA": "welcome back to the kitchen guys we have an extremely delicious recipe in store one of my favorite kinds just a big loaf of bread right because you can meal prep it you could freeze it you could toast it you can dip it you could top it anything you want we're gonna be making a garlic and Asiago bread and it's going to be super delicious and dense and it toasts up beautifully and it's also great for serving with like a olive oil dipping sauce we're gonna start with the dry ingredients and get those mixed in a bowl so the first thing we're going to add to our bowl is almond flour we're gonna do 1 and 1/4 cup to this we're gonna add 1/4 cup of coconut flour so I love mixing coconut flour and almond flour I know it feels like you know you it's extra work because you have two flours but it always creates such a better consistency of any baked good or a baked baked loaf so I highly recommend you stick to this ratio we got here so that's 1/4 cup 3 tablespoons of ground flax seeds and you can use golden which we have here or you can use just the normal standard brown ones either way it adds a nice toasty flavor the golden flax seeds in my opinion do taste a little bit better though so we like to use it when we can we're gonna do 1 teaspoon very small of psyllium husk powder and psyllium husk does a great job in binding so you don't need a ton of it but it'll make all the difference sprinkle that in we're gonna do 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda so now we're just gonna give this a quick mix and then we'll set it aside and get the wet going so in this bowl a large bowl because we're gonna be adding the dry to the wet I have 1/4 cup of butter that I'm going to quickly melt down in the microwave and then to the melted butter we're gonna add the rest of our ingredients we're gonna do 1/3 cup of water 3 large eggs then we're gonna do 2 more ingredients we do 5 drops of liquid stevia and just a little 1/4 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and from baking lots of breads these are the two tricks we found that really cut through that eggy taste so if you're not a fan of the eggy tastes in low carb keto breads try one of these two or both and that'll emit that eggy taste so just five drops that'll do the trick and it won't make it sweet and then just a little bit of apple cider vinegar we're gonna give this a whisk and then in two batches we're gonna add in the dry ingredients as we whisk let's get half of that is perfect we're gonna let that sit for just a minute as it thickens up from the psyllium husk and we are going to slice up some garlic and as it sits the coconut flour and the psyllium husk they'll really help to thicken up the bread batter so it's not as thin as it was when you were mixing it it'll be slightly thicker when we fold in the cheese and the garlic babies Trent are we supposed to be able to like lift cars I have five pretty big pieces of garlic here and I'm gonna be using for this bread loaf you can go a lot more if you want you can go a lot less you can actually toast these before you even add them into the loaf or you can just slice them and add them in and they will bake with the rest of the ingredients so that's what we're gonna do I'm gonna go pretty big slices I don't want to like mince it up I want to see those beautiful pieces of garlic okay that looks good to me now I'm gonna add this just garlic to the batter along with our cheese so we have half a cup of shredded asiago cheese that we shredded ourselves so we just bought a big block of it shredded it up and we are just going to fold all this in so you can now see that the bread batter itself is a lot thicker than it was when we first were mixing it if you look at all the beautiful chunks of garlic that's what you want to see so here we have a standard eight and a half by four and a half loaf pan so we're gonna grease this up with some coconut oil but you could also line it with some parchment paper that might be easy to pull it out should we do that yeah you usually do regret just using spray and you can also give it a spray so the parchment paper will stay down that's what we're gonna do perfect okay so now we are just going to add our batter right into the loaf pan spread it out okay that looks good now we're gonna pop this in the oven at 375 for forty to fifty minutes it'll all vary depending on your oven so we're gonna check on it pretty early because the edges will Brown and then you can test it with the toothpick if you insert a toothpick and it comes out wet then you know it needs another five to ten minutes so I will just gauge it on that so we'll be back shortly to check on it all right guys it's been 35 minutes and we just took a quick check and we did the toothpick test and it came out clean so again I said forty to fifty but check on it pretty early depending on your oven I think we're good to go let's pull this puppy out oh my god that's beautiful you could see the garlic you could smell the garlic so we're gonna let that cool for a bit before we give it a try this looks a phenomenal check that out it's nice and browned you can see the garlic it roasted for sure and like I said this was in the oven for 35 minutes so it comes right out with the parchment paper perfect that looks so good so dense and if there's something to know about me that's really important it's that I love the end pieces I guess I'll cut a couple slices but do you hear that well baby and again this toasts up great look at those garlic chunks another slice for you [Music] probably want to let it cool but you know us so this is looking great I'm gonna take the end piece of course hmm hmm I see how goes very unique never really tried to do anything except her bread have you Matt yeah but in except in bread have you ever eaten it just like on okay it's like the perfect flavor profile for a baked too good for a bread and in that garlic like the combination you get a little spice of the garlic and the golden flaxseed meal really makes a difference nice and toasty perfect for dipping bread but even better for toasting up in my opinion and then lathering with some butter oh man like some flavor butter additional garlic butter rosemary butter that would be so good with this linked below is the recipe and the instructions step by step how to make this and all the ingredients you're going to need to make this delicious keto garlic and

hi guys so today I will be talking about the garlic butter naturally favorite flavored Ritz crackers I just want to show you guys what the box looks like before I get started talking about these so it says / 5 crackers so guys these are just 5 crackers 80 calories 1 gram of saturated fat 110 milligrams of sodium and one gram of sugar the net weight is 13.7 once's and I believe that's for the whole box and then it just says serving suggestion over here and yeah 388 grams so getting started about these crackers Ritz was always like such a foreign brand to me growing up like my parents never really purchased these crackers just because I come from such a big household and this box will probably be gone in like two days and even now what's really funny is that I live by myself and I actually purchased these on my own this box is usually gone within two days so I can only imagine if like my mom purchasing this for all of me and my siblings it'd probably be gone the same day to be honest but yeah this brand was such a foreign brand to me and I remember if anybody is like I remember growing up and like going to certain events I used to always have like dance recitals and things like that at the little refreshment tables it would always be Ritz crackers and like cheese or like meat or like spinach dip or anything chicken salad like it would always be with like these crackers and I just always told my mom every time ones in store like please please please please so my mom like never came in I think it wasn't until like my sophomore year of high school my mom ended up making tuna salad and for there's like I don't know this is kind of like a weird debate that I was like having because like I love tuna but I hate it with bread I only tuna with crackers and my mom made tuna salad and she was like oh my goodness there's no more crackers and like it's like half of my siblings eat it with bread the other half won't eat it with won't eat it with bread so it's kind of like my mom was like okay like meat crackers and so my dad was already out and my mom was like just text your dad and ask him pickup crackers and I remember guys the biggest finesse in my life I texted my dad and was like mommy said pick up Ritz crackers before where the tuna salad and I saw you guys like probably a stupid story but that's the first time I actually ate Ritz crackers like within like my own like the own comfort of my home and I was so happy I remember even taking the box and like stashing one of these little packs of it and so I was like I was so happy like my day was made as a child but yeah so after that my mom got mad and we never really purchased them anymore but the minute I hit college and I could do whatever I wanted to do I definitely started purchasing Ritz crackers by myself I loved these crackers so much even the original ones are really good but these are my favorite favorite favorite Ritz crackers if you guys don't like our like butter or like just like the garlic you taste I don't suggest getting these crackers because a lot of times one thing says garlic butter you can't really taste like the garlic in my opinion something sometimes it's just like a buttery taste but guys these crackers you really can't taste the garlic so if you guys really aren't interested in like garlic butter or like just the garlic taste of it I suggest not getting them the original crackers on its own is very savory and those do taste very buttery but these ones just the garlic is just amazing and I am a big fan of like garlic butter and just garlic in general and so these are my favorite crackers I want to tell you guys what I use these for so if anybody's interested or in like a ever heard of like the the travel-size roots are like the smaller-sized roots which are like I want to say about half this pack and it comes in like a 12 count I believe it might be a little bit smaller than half that pack but it's about this serving size actually guys right here on the box the serving size that's about how many come in the little tiny travel packages that is what I usually get the only reason I got these is because we were having like a potluck for my sorority and I ended up purchasing like three of these boxes and I made spinach dip but yeah so I suggest that we live by yourself and you're not trying to feed multiple people get the smaller packages of this but anyway though two crackers gonna taste the same either way I did pull a package out because I wanted to show you guys so the Ritz cracker general are in famous for these little brown little bags that they keep to keep the stillness and keep the freshness of the cracker this is how like one long bag of this looks and it just has all these little good tasting crackers in there something that me and one of my roommates does is because we do go halfsies sometimes when buying these we'll cut it in like the center if we plan on eating it in one sitting we'll cut it in the center and then we'll just go halfsies with it another thing that I found to keep them fresh is if you guys have ten cans and you do open them and you don't trust the whole twisting it at the top part something else that like me and my roommates tend to do is we tend to put it in tin cans I don't know why but that kind of conserves the freshness of the product something else cool that like I seen one of my other roommates does and she'll take like a little hair clip and she'll clip it to the top or something that I personally do is I throw them in the fridge and I'll like twist the top but I'll just like put it in the fridge and it won't get stale to me it's just like a cold cracker which I love eating with chicken salad and stuff but getting started on that some cool things that I like doing with these crackers is I love dressing them up I'll make spinach spinach dip like I mentioned a little bit earlier chicken salads my all-time favorite tuna salad love tuna salad or you can just go the casual typical way and just do the cheese and the meat she's also not bad too or if you guys want to make homemade Lunchables that's the thing that you guys can do with these two but like I said these are just like the Ritz crackers garlic butter naturally flavor at once and these are so good and I like these so much [Music]", "Q6z0Ohu1__o": "what's happening it is cute Abbas babe here and today we are making 90-second bread it is the perfect bride for school lunches or for work so go ahead and take a look at this easy recipe so this is one of the easiest bread recipes and I love that you can make just individual portions it's perfect for the kids for school lunch so you can make it in a mug but I'm not going to make it in a little bit larger of a dish because it's not the size of like a piece of bread that my kids would have so super easy I'm gonna add in 3 tablespoons of almond flour and then just 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and the last ingredient is just an egg now there are some awesome ways that you can kind of mix this up you can put in garlic salt you can add in about a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a little bit of swerve or pure and make it a chocolate I'm like kind of cake for your kids also there's lots of options we're just gonna mix this up and get it ready for the microwave so we've got it all mixed up here I did not have to pre greased it because I must have the butter in here first and then 90-second bread we just put it the microwave for 90 seconds so our 90 seconds is over let's go ahead and take a look looks perfect so it's kind of fluffed up a little bit in there pulled away from the edges make sure you use hot pads because it is a hot bowl so we're gonna give it just a second to cool down and then we'll cut it in half and see how it looks so we let it cool down just a little bit so I've got a little plate here we'll flip it over looks like an awesome piece of bread so I'm just gonna take it and cut it in half and then this will make the two sides for my sandwich so I've got my egg salad here on my bread and I can either have an open-faced sandwich just like this or I can use the other piece and put it on top when it's ready for school all I do is drop it in my little lunch box and I've got the perfect lunch for my children or the perfect lunch for me to take to work keep it simple keep it fun keep Paquito have an awesome day", "UCyw0FdtIlE": "does anybody know what this is well this\nis a jicama it is a root vegetable that's popular in Central America in\nSouth America - it's kind of like a turnip a cross between like maybe a\npotato and a turnip but they're very very low in carbs so they're great for\nthe keto diet and it make a really good substitute for french fries and that's\nwhat we're making today we're gonna make some keto jicama french fries so let's\nget started so if you've never cooked with jicama\nbefore like I said it's a root vegetable but this is one root vegetable that you\ncan eat on the keto diet it's very very low in carbohydrates and it looks just\nlike a potato and actually tastes just like a potato when you fry it up and we\nhave a special batter that's going to go on these guys it actually is a batter\nthat kind of reminds me of curly fries to make jicama fries the first thing you\nhave to do is peel this you need to peel the outer skin off of your jicama and\nthen we're gonna start slicing we're gonna cut these into matchstick slices\nthat are French fries I like to cut them really really thin into like a\nshoestring sized french fry you could do thicker too but I just think that then\nones really make it look more authentic like a french fry and plus it's able to\ncook all the way through so you really do get to that french fry flavor so once your jicama is all cut up into\nfrench fry shapes now it's time to make our seasoning so the seasoning that I'm\ngonna make I'm gonna add some a little special blend we're actually going to be\nputting these dredging these in protein powder and the protein powder I'm going\nto be using an is by perfect keto this is their unflavored protein powder\nit's the protein powder that I love to use during any of my cooking or baking\nit has really clean ingredients it's just like it's whey protein basically\nand they add some MCT oils in it for energy\nit's grass-fed protein - so really good for you definitely check them out I'll\nhave some discounts listed down below for you guys they proudly have\nsponsored this video for me so I could show you my favorite recipe for jicama\nfries in a bowl we're gonna add our unflavored protein powder and then I\nlike to season my jicama fries with a combination of salt garlic powder and\nonion powder if you want to do a spicy version you could add a little bit of\ncayenne pepper or some chili powder would be really good too basically we're\ngonna toss in our cut-up jicama strips and then coat them evenly with our\nprotein powder mixture and now it's time to fry the jicama I'm\ngonna be frying my jicama in a skillet you can do this in an airfryer too or\nbake them I just think that it's more authentic you really get that fried\ncrispy french fry flavor coming out when you fry it in some avocado oil so in\nthis skillet I have a little bit of avocado oil you want just enough to\ncover your fries and then once it's heated over medium heat and there's\nenough heat in it to where if you were to drop in a crumb of the protein powder\nit starts to sizzle now your oil is hot enough to add your french fries so let's\nadd in our jicama fries and we're just gonna cook these until they developed a\nbeautiful golden brown color let them dry on a paper towel before\nserving and then taste them and see if they need any additional seasoning or\nsalt and that's a super simple jicama fries this makes a really good weekend\nor weeknight side dish especially if you're going to be serving some grilled\nhamburgers or hot dogs gotta have some french fries with a hamburger\nso this is our Kido option it's delicious make sure you guys try it\ndon't forget to check out perfect keto and make sure you subscribe to

use a stem as well [Music] Sullivan Jews will have the color to be Prasad and you need to be sure it and overheat the mixer so now we add oil if you want you can use olive oil but if you keep in the fridge it gets set and the flavor of the olive oil will affect the flavors from the coriander and mint so I'm just using plain oil so if you're using that's a hundred gram of leaf mix hundred gram of oil will be good enough so it's ready to blend now I can blend it fine paste and then we will strain it off okay so the Minden curry under oil is ready we just turn it off just use a nice just use a fine strainer then allow to drip out slowly and pour more and if you have a cheesecloth you can use that a fine clothes to drain it yeah hello to drip it slowly so the oil is strained [Music] the mint and coriander all nice green color now we can use it for flavouring the food finishing it off for garnishes and everything I'm going to place it in ask using model and keeping it you can freeze it also you can keep in the fridge freezing I will give a long shelf life and it does not change color [Music] all right so make going to make a brown garlic levena base you can use a nice thick labneh forget otherwise I'm going to use a cream cheese and a thick yogurt a lovely is basically for yogurt but is slightly more thicker and creamier so let the pan heat up Oh some oil finely chopped garlic now something to brown so once it's nice golden brown color or just crunchy you stop cooking then turn to a bowl and allow to cool down okay so ground garlic ugly or bit of cream cheese and yogurt I'm making some putting cream cheese two tablespoons [Music] now I'm adding yogurt again 2 so 2 spoon of yogurt as well touch of salt there is salt already in the cream cheese lots of salt mix a touch of chaat masala mix it nicely there's no lumps can use a whisk also and the finish it off you can add a touch of oil but it gives a nice shine to the sauce so you can see there's a nice shine so the sauce is ready you can keep in the fridge or you can use it as you want it [Music]", "JyBnVTQtu90": "Hello and welcome to in the \nkitchen with Matt, I am your host, Matt Taylor. Today, I'm going to show you \nhow to make baked tuna patties. Oh, yeah. These tuna patties are really \nsimple to make easy ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. Before I move on, make sure to \nsubscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you \nwon't miss out on any of my new videos. Let's get Beijing down below. In the description box, \nyou'll find a list of the ingredients and their amounts \nbegin with one half cup of breadcrumbs. Or if you are gluten intolerant \nor gluten free, you can use almond flour or almond meal. And I'm going to add one fourth \nteaspoon of salt, one fourth teaspoon of black pepper and \none half teaspoon of garlic powder, and then just \ncome in here with a fork or a little whisk unless \nthose together I would make\nit first like this. And then afterwards, when you \nmake it again, you could adjust the salt and the pepper if \nyou want, and the garlic powder will set that aside. And then now I have one large \negg here and I just want to it up and I have one tablespoon of \nwater and I just saved some water from the canned tuna. The canned tuna I'm using was \npacked in water, not oil. So you want to use the tuna \nthat's packed in water and then now we will add \nadditional oil. This is two teaspoons \nof olive oil. I like to have control \nover the oil. So that's why I don't\nuse the tuna in the oil. We're stuck together a \nlittle bit and then I have two teaspoons \nof yellow mustard and you could use Dijon mustard as well. And what, just keep \nwith the together. And now I have two cans of the \nstandard size cans here in the United States of tuna, the five \nounce cans or the 141 gram cans. All right. So I put those in this large \nbowl and now pour in that egg mixture, one fourth \ncup of chopped parsley. And then we have \nthat breadcrumbs, dry mixture analysis. Mix this all together. I'm just using a fork \nto do this. OK, and then what I do is I \njust kind of cut it down a little bit and then I just want \nto divide it into fourths. I just eyeball it like this, \nlike that, just so I kind of know how much to dig out. And now this part, you just \nwant to clean have clean hands when you do this or you can \nwear gloves and we want to form the patties and place them on a \nsilicone mat lined sheet pan. Or you can use parchment \npaper as well. And then so we\nwill dig out that mixture. And just put it in your hand, \njust like you said, if you're making homemade burger patties. And just put it into a paddy \nshape and put it on your pan there. Again, you can use gloves or \njust make sure your hands are washed. You can shape them like this \nand then pat them down, shape them like this, pat him \ndown exactly how I would do like a hamburger patty. All right, now that the patties \nare done, we will bake them in the oven, preheated oven, \n375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190 Celsius, and we will bake \nthem for 10 minutes and then flip them over and bake them \nfor another 10 minutes onto that step. And when they come out of \nthe oven, they will look something like this lightly \nround on the top and they'll look a little\nbit dry all over. And there you go. And also, if you want to cook \nthese in a skillet with oil, you can do that as well. Instead, baking it \nis healthier, but also a skillet version is great. And you just brown it. You cook it for about four \nminutes per side on medium heat in the skillet. So you can do it that way \nas well, if you like. And then we'll just let this \ncool for about 10 minutes and then you can eat them. And then now you could\nuse this as you would a hamburger patty. I'm going to cut into it and \nshow you what it looks like on the inside. And so there it is, \nit's just the. Inside of it, pretty awesome. And that is how you \nmake tuna patties. I really love hamburger and \nhamburger patties, but I also love tuna, so it's really nice \nto have something different once in a while. And you can eat them plain just \nlike this, or you can put them in place of a hamburger and \nhave a tuna burger. Really easy to do. If I can do it, you can do it. I'm Matt Taylor.

Uh.", "n4cT4eYVyv8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today we're gonna bake a cake not a cake we're gonna d cake the best pizza cake you could imagine like the best birthday cake you could even think of i mean it's cheese salami pepperoni dough just a piece of goodness so i'm super excited for this one and if you haven't already hit subscribe up there i usually upload once a week and so let's get started with the dough so we're gonna start with six cups or 750 grams of flour two packs of 14 grams of dried yeast one and a quarter tablespoons 20 milliliters of olive oil three teaspoons or 16 grams of salt and around one tablespoon of sugar and then we're gonna mix all dry ingredients together make sure you put the flour to a strainer just a little crumbs inside then we're gonna add our dried yeast and then our salt and sugar and then just whisk it together and make sure they're nicely combined before we gonna add our liquid ingredients which will be one and a half cups or 400 milliliters of tap warm water and our olive oil again will be one and a quarter tablespoons or 20 milliliters olive oil and then just mix all together and let it doughnut for around 10 to 15 minutes just until it's nicely combined and yeah after that's done we're gonna cover the dough and let it rise for around an hour or until it doubles in size make sure you lightly grease your bowl so it will not stick in there just put some plastic wrap on top put it on a nice warm place and now we're going to make our tomato sauce we're going to start with half of onion that we cut in small dices you can see here what's the easiest way to do that make sure you don't cut them too small for now just that they don't burn because we will caramelize them for probably about 10 minutes oh yeah i use olive oil in this recipe just put around like one tablespoon of olive oil in there now we just let them caramelize for 10 to 15 minutes on low to medium heat and towards the end we're gonna add two cloves of garlic you can just crush them then we're going to add one tablespoon of tomato paste let it roast for like five minutes and then we're gonna add half a cup of red wine just put in let it simmer for a little bit to get rid of the alcohol and then we're gonna add one cup of cut tomatoes just you can use the canned ones what i did if you want to use fresh ones feel free to do that and then we're going to add two bay leaves some garlic some pepper some salt some oregano some rosemary some basil just some italian flavoring seasoning i will put the exact amount in the description but at the end use what you think you like and just work with it okay then we're going into our dough which should be doubled in size by now which you can see here and as always we're gonna form a thick fat torpedo out of it this time we're gonna cut them into six equal pieces which each one is around 200 grams big make six balls out of them just as always just wrap your hands around and form into a nice ball as you can see here in the video you might take a few tries until you get the nice foam ball but then you have six balls formed like this cover them with plastic wrap let them rise for another hour and then they should look exactly like this and now we're going to form our pizza lightly flour your work surface you're going to put the dough on it and then i use a yeah i use a rolling pin sorry guys i'm not as fancy i don't know how to toss the dough around and yeah just use a rolling pin make sure it stays round um then i stretch it a little bit by hand that's the fanciest i can go um yeah just stretch it it's probably around an eighth of an inch thick and then we're going to place the dough on the baking tray covered with some parchment paper and after you put it on there you're going to use your cake ring which is nine and a half inches or 24 centimeters wide in my case so the diameter is nine and a half or 24 centimeters and then just press it down remove the excess dough and make sure you do all this on the baking tray because you move it afterwards it will not keep its round shape which is really important if you want you can also use a fork and just punch some holes inside so it will not blow up and then put it in the oven by 400 degrees fahrenheit or 200 degrees celsius for around three to four minutes then you're going to repeat that four more times until you have four pizza doughs next we're going to make the wall for that we use our last two remaining pizza balls just roll them out into like a long slab and wrap them around the cake ring just that they cover around half of it just measure it like this put them aside and next we're going to cut our ingredients we're going to cut some pepperoni i use some italian sausage use some olives as well at the end you can use whatever you want just don't use too many wet ingredients so then we're gonna lightly grease our cake ring place the dough wall in there be careful that you don't rip it apart really be careful because that would ruin the whole thing and after that we're going to remove the excess dough just i use a razor blade for that just remove it down there leave a little bit on there so it will stick together but don't leave all of it there so then we're going to place our thickest um pizza in there and again when you put it in be really careful that you don't break the wall because again the pizza cake wouldn't look that great and everything would ooze out we don't want that then oh you have to pasteurize or you have to put your sauce through the mixer or you can if you want to i did it so place one two tablespoons in there then add some mozzarella cheese we're also gonna add some pepperoni and our italian sausage and all is in there just put all of them in there and after that we're going to add the second like pizza dough on top of it also pre-baked around two to three minutes the reason why we did that is just that the pizza will not need that much time in the oven afterwards like i said we're gonna repeat that step four more times and yeah i personally really like this pizza cake for any birthday or if you have friends coming over to be honest it's just great to have it's something else i mean not everyone has a pizza cake it's a birthday cake so i really like that and it's super easy to make and it's not expensive it's really not expensive at all so as you can see some of them i poked with a fork just so that they don't blow up and for the top you just place it on there put the remaining tomato sauce on it then roll the excess dough in there so it really looks like a pizza like a really thick crust pizza i like to add everything i have inside the pizza on top so you know what you about to expect and it will look like this and then we're going to place it in oven for around 15 to 20 minutes by 200 degrees celsius or 400 degrees fahrenheit then after that time we're gonna remove the ring and place it back in the oven just for another five minutes after that we going to use some butter i just want two tablespoons of butter add around one teaspoon of oregano around a half a teaspoon of garlic powder and one tablespoon of parmesan and just mix all that together and we're going to cover our outside of the pizza with that it's completely optional i like to do it gives it like a nice herby taste just use and just put it all up there and then we put it back in the oven for another two to three minutes literally not long just a little bit just make sure you cover you're going to cover the whole pizza like i said this whole thing is optional you don't have to do it i like the taste just gives like a nice herby flavor to it and yeah after you're done with that put it back in the oven like i said around two to five minutes just keep an eye on it make sure it's not burning or anything and after that's done we're done with our pizza cake and as i said it's not difficult it's a super easy alternative for any party and it's cheap and it's something else i love it and look at this beauty i mean you have all these layers of cheese you have yeah all these flavors together and it's just amazing again thanks so much for watching check out my other videos and hit subscribe up there see you guys next week", "wKSP_j9PNGc": "Welcome all!  Papa G here.  Today I present\nwhat some may call an appetizer, but I like as a meal all on its own...\nlow carbohydrate crab stuffed mushrooms with a savory lemon butter garlic sauce. A very\neasy recipe to make and has less than four carbohydrates per serving.  Let's get started. \nWe'll begin by pouring 8 ounces of crab meat into a medium mixing bowl.  Add 2\nounces of softened cream cheese; 3 tablespoons of sour cream; 1/4 cup of\ngrated Parmesan cheese; some fresh chopped chives; minced garlic; some salt;\nblack pepper; some Old Bay seasoning; and just a bit of cayenne pepper.  Give that a\ngood mix to incorporate thoroughly.  Cover with some plastic wrap and store in the\nrefrigerator while we prep the mushrooms. I'll be using baby Bella or cremini\nmushrooms for this recipe.  We'll need about 16 ounces.  Prep the mushrooms by\nremoving and discarding the stems.  With a small spoon, gently remove the gills and\nmake the cavity just a bit larger.  Don't run the mushrooms under water or soak\nthem too clean.  They're like sponges and they'll soak up a lot of moisture. \nInstead, just use a damp towel and wipe them clean.  Remove the crab meat from the\nrefrigerator and stir to loosen.  You can substitute a 9 by 13 inch baking dish\nhere, but I wanted an excuse to use my new individual baking dishes I received\nfor Christmas.  Fill each mushroom cap with about a teaspoon of the crab meat\nmixture.  This next step adds a nice texture to the recipe.  After filling the\nmushrooms gently press the top to some ground pork rinds.  Continue until all the\nmushrooms are filled. Place the baking dishes on a cookie sheet and\nplace in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F oven for 15 minutes.  While our\nmushrooms bake, we'll work on our sauce. To a sauce pot on medium-high heat,  add 8\ntablespoons of unsalted butter and about a half a tablespoon of minced garlic; add\nsome fresh chopped chives and the juice of one lemon.  When the butter is melted,\nreduce the heat to medium-low and let stew. After the mushrooms have baked for 15\nminutes, remove them from the oven. Now equally distribute the butter sauce over\nthe tops of each and place back in the oven for 5 additional minutes.  Remove, and\nadd some dried parsley to the tops.  Plate and serve.  The aroma of this dish will\ncall your guests before you do.  Very soft and creamy - and the pork rinds add just\nthe right amount of texture... delicious! There you have it folks!  My low carbohydrate crab\nstuffed mushrooms with a savory lemon butter garlic sauce.  A great start to a\nlow carbohydrate New Year!  I hope you enjoyed this video.

kitchen kitchen and this is 10 second living where I show you how to do practically anything in 10 seconds or less and today I am going to show you how to smash and peel garlic this is a really efficient way to peel garlic but then also sometimes you don't need to actually mince garlic for a recipe especially if you're into using something with garlic so smashing it it's a great way to open up all of that flavor or without having to bother getting fussy with the cutting so let's get started place the garlic clove under the chef's knife and slam the on the flat side of the knife with your fist peel the garlic and smash again and that's it the garlic is smashed now it's ready to pop into whatever sauce or oil I want to infuse and get that delicious garlic flavor out for recipes featuring this technique check out my blog the kitchen kitchen calm", "akW4hOSYIWM": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today i am going to be reviewing platinum garlic by sonoran roots now i just got a tester sample here you guys i don't even know if this is on shelves i'm not even sure if this is a phenotype that they're gonna end up running and going with um but i got myself a sample of this stuff so i'm really excited to try it now i have never tried platinum garlic and if you haven't let's go ahead and talk about it this is an indica dominant hybrid that is a cross between the ever so popular gmo and platinum so it's a cross between garlic cookies and platinum you guys i am really excited this one is supposed to be a heavy hitter i've heard upwards of 30 testing in the thc um now that's just based on you know the genetics so not to say this is where this is testing out but i'm really excited to get into it let me bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're going to take a look at it together okay so how about the platinum garlic honestly the looks the look still looks but let's see the smell let's try the smell first wow this is interesting it's like it's something that i feel like i haven't smelled before it's the platinum because i have it's almost like a purple punch mixed with gmo it's kind of spicy and peppery it's interesting because i keep seeing like peppery and spicy you know a lot of people talk about spicy strains and this has kind of a peppery aroma to it it's very interesting it's very unique it's very different almost mixed with again like a the sweetness of a purple punch now i'm having like it is there the flavor's there but it's very reserved and i'm really having a break you know into these buds and actually press on them to get that smell to come out but when you press on them that's spicy aroma it poof wow it really comes out it's peppery um sweet peppery um now let's look at it because truthfully this smells kind of crazy to me oh my god this stuff is glistening covered in trichome on the outside of the bud on the inside of the butt hairs are literally jumping off the freaking bud you guys oh my god oh my god i wonder if it's gonna focus i mean you guys already saw the pictures and just wait till i get it under the macro lens oh wow it's kind of a little leafy but it's not if that makes sense you know it's kind of larfy leafy if that makes sense so like just maybe a leafier looking bud but these peach colored hairs are everywhere they're jumping off the freaking bud and this stuff is so frosty underneath the bud like where you would break off a nug and i'm gonna do that here in just a second it is so frosty this stuff looks so legitimately killer it's honestly shocking i only got these two tester nugs let me break open one of these here some more of that garlic is coming out but let me look on the inside here and see what's up with the oh yeah just some great trichome coverage now i am really excited to puff some of this um i only have these two tester nugs and i wanted to show you them before i started breaking them up to get ready to pop and honestly it's sweet it's very sweet when broken up oh my god almost a little bit sour wow wow i wish that flavor wasn't so subdued in the bag and i'm almost wondering if it's may have lost a little bit of its um integrity in that bag you know i know that uh a lot of the sonoran rude stuff you you know you find will either be in a jar or you know at least a little medicine pill uh pill bottle but let me give this stuff a smell and now that i've got it ground up because it really was a little bit subdued for my personal liking it's sweet it's like plat it's honestly like purple punch sour the garlic and that is kind of covered up by like a little bit of the spiciness wow this stuff broke up so nice it's so nice when it broke up like this is when i break up bud i mean man the consistency of the way that this bud actually broke up was so so enjoyable um and it is fresh i mean it's it's it's really keeping the integrity of the bud this stuff did not just break up and crumble into dust by any means now i'm gonna go ahead let this bowl warm up on the vape a little bit and actually while i'm doing while i'm doing that actually i could let this warm up while i'm showing you what i'm smoking out of today because today i'm gonna enjoy some of the platinum garlic out of my arizer extreme cute desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees as you see right there i've got my whip which is just a silicone tube that gets the vape from the vaporizer to me and with the screen on it that's going into the vape itself the other end is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler now i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers i've got distilled water in the second an organic cotton filter and third that'll filter out any potential impurities that did not get flushed or purged out in the final stages of growing so man i i know this isn't going to be warmed up super super hot just yet only because it hasn't really been sitting on the um the bowl for very long while warmed i literally just got it ground up wow like sweet cookies does that smell good wow wow so it might take me a little bit to get this bowl going i may take three rips on screen with you guys here but you know if you guys are ready to blaze let's get into it and see what this platinum garlic by sonoran roots is all about okay it's just a little bit of visible vape i have that cleaning like it's almost a little wow i it smell it tastes to me excuse me like cleaning product like fresh cotton or fresh linen like detergent eat almost honestly not a super fan of this initial taste here but let me go ahead and dive in for the second one kind of like soapy that's the best way to describe it wow this stuff is so smooth like baby buttery smooth yeah like sweet soap or like florally soap the flavor is not translating very well for me i got to be honest you know a little earthy yeah that's kind of what i'm getting out of it a tiny bit of sweetness but definitely like soapy you know fresh lineny kind of type taste yeah i mean that was only the second rip honestly i'll probably take the rest of the rips off screen here just because i did get some flavor out of that first one while i'm finishing this bowl i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the macro lens and oh my god you're going to be so impressed i can't wait for you to see it so here comes the platinum garlic now okay so you are looking at the platinum garlic by sonoran roots and oh my god i swear to god if i wasn't looking at it with my own eyes i wouldn't even think this bud was real look at how awesome this bud looks under the macro lens those peach colored hairs they're like creamy orange are straight up jumping off of this butt look at how long they are you guys i mean it's funny but you would look at this and think this butt is probably fluffy it's not it's extremely dense and look at the trichomes i mean the trichomes look the hairs have trichomes on them i mean does it get any more crystally does it get any more hairy it's a light green color truthfully this is what picturesque bud looks like this stuff should be in an absolute magazine trimmed um perfectly no excess leaf matter and overall this is some bomb ass dang okay so what did you think of the platinum garlic under that macro lens tell me that stuff is not out of control crazy cool right love love the look of this stuff i gotta be honest that's actually probably for me the most redeeming quality about this but i will admit this stuff definitely fell short in a couple different categories for me and i really want to talk about those so you guys how i do all of my strain reviews is i rate these strains out of 10 0 being the worst 10 being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories the look smell taste and potency or how effective this medicine is i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories and then give you guys my final rundown on what i think of this strain after i tally up the total of those four categories um and anything seven or above is going to get our dank thumbs up approval anything seven or below will obviously not and then in the end if it does get a seven or above i'll give you my recommendation like would i pick up this strain again so let's go ahead and start by talking about the looks or bag appeal i want it to be fresh in your mind and i don't have a nug here anymore since i just smoked it so let's bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to check out then i'll go ahead and get into my final review okay so you've seen the platinum garlic multiple times i mean this stuff was so picturesque i know i only had the small little two buds there but the one bud oh my god those orange hairs just like they're peach colored really jumping off of the bud the light bud it was just looked like somebody had just come with thc crystals and scattered them all over this bud this is what picturesque bud looks like maybe not the best butt i've ever seen in my life but oh my god is it up there as just an unbelievable looking strain this is a 2.5 out of 2.5 for me now the smell the smell the smell the smell the smell is really a bummer because to be honest if the flavor wasn't so subdued in that bag it would have done better in the smell department but the bag it was just too reserved in the bag i really had to break those nugs up and get into them um you know to release the aroma there it was that nice sweet spicy kind of purple punch um you know flavor and honestly i really really enjoyed that there's no question about it but again it shouldn't take me having to break it up and bust into it to get to that point it did grind up really nice as you guys saw i'm gonna only go ahead and give it a 1.5 in the smell you guys know how i take away a point you know if it's just lacking terps in the back and i feel like though there were some they were just way too um pulled back to give them the benefit of doubt and give them a 2.0 even though i guarantee if this bud you know was a full eighth probably even still it shouldn't need to be a full eighth i mean this this nug should have stunk up the bag let's i'm not get cut i'm not cutting them the slack in that category and the taste let's get to the taste now for me it wasn't that this stuff wasn't smooth or it didn't go back smooth it just is about the flavor in general like that soapy flavor it was kind of it got a little better towards the end when the soapiness went away but like overall there was just nothing to write home about no real good flavors to report like that soapy sweet flavor to me was just not my favorite i don't think many people would like it to be honest um oh my goodness my dog just threw the camera there um but i'll tell you that uh you know for me the actual um you know the taste it just wasn't there and it just it left a lot to be desired so it's only going to be a 1.5 in the taste now in the potency and you know if you guys have been following it's a 2.5 in the look it's a 1.5 in the smell and a 1.5 in the taste so right now we're at a five and a half you know the potency for me i personally just don't feel like this stuff is getting the job done for me i have a little pressure on the head a little bit of you know relaxation in the body but like this stuff just didn't take me where i was going and it just didn't get me on the level um you know i really thought this was going to be a 2.0 from the way that it was hitting it was smooth it was nice some a few good coughs um you know not like because it was harsh but just some you know good coughs and it just it really has just come on you know and kind of just it's not really ever done anything you know so it's only going to be a 1.5 for me in the potency which brings us to a 7.0 so the platinum garlic is actually believe it or not because the look saved it by its teeth gonna get our thumbs up dank approval here on the channel and a seven by again the skin of its teeth you know and i don't think it should go without saying would i you know would i recommend this strain myself and go pick this stuff up for 45 or 50 bucks 55 bucks you know i personally wouldn't um because the seven just isn't there i mean i need the taste to be there i need you know the smell to be there and i mean just soapy terps just don't do it for me i don't know who would really be into these um you know uh purple punch the flavor that i did have there is just a little overdone and it's just not even done super well in my opinion um i would go with a different pheno um you know something maybe that has more of the gmo in it to be honest um you know the platinum pull away from the platinum you guys um that's my recommendation but yeah listen 7.0 is not bad by any means i mean i'm happy when i find a 7.0 so dang thumbs up uh approval here on our channel um but yeah let me know if you guys tried this train are you looking to try it you know um let me know if you found it by now i don't think this

i will see you guys soon peace", "RwHUrNJQsgg": "peep this out guys it's Ian K back\nagain with another one for ya' swinging up on my local Papa John's today guys\ntake a look at their latest side item that's bringing a little cheddar cheese\ngoodness to some of their classic garlic knots and hey since I checked out those\nparmesan bread twists from dominos a couple of months ago I was very curious\nto see what Papa John's was gonna do for their version even if it is a different\ntype of cheese now being that Papa John's doesn't have a drive-thru it\nmeans I gotta go in and scoop these up so let me do just that and like always\nbefore I give you my thoughts on them like I always do let's get right up on\nhim first but I closer look let's peep this out better ingredients leads to\nhopefully a better garlic knot here at Papa John's guys are in this case the\ngarlic cheddar knots wow I got to say presentation-wise that already pops very\nvery nicely in the cheddar Department on top of looking super fluffy take a look\nat these looks like we've got an 8 piece order here like their standard garlic\nknots only these are actually coated up with cheddar and garlic specifically and\nI got to say it is a very very nice combo it looks really really fantastic\nalmost like they're little croissants actually if you look at the way these\nare lined up here I'm really diggin' that and I think it should go nicely\nwith my sauce of choice in this case it is gonna be ranch so obviously very\npuffy looking bread here and a pretty thick sauce I'm hoping should go pretty\nnicely I am already excited to give these a shot just by this appearance so\nlet's get into it these are the all new garlic cheddar nuts here at Papa John's\nlet's peep out this flavor so these swap out the parmesan with\ncheddar and I got to say guys one thing I really like about these is that they\nare not very oily at all as you can see in the very bottom there this is not\nswimming in any type of garlic sauce it actually has garlic spread out all on\ntop as well as that melted cheddar so let's get into this it looks great it's\nthe new garlic cheddar knots here at Papa John's mmm instantly a garlic\nloaded piece of fluffy pizza dough guys that is actually really really tasty the\ncheddar cheese comes up on the back end but the garlic is really the star of the\nshow with this one I do like the light cheddar that comes up on the back it's\nnot really overpowering but I have to say the overall flavor of the pizza\ndough is actually nice this was made fresh right now and I gotta say it makes\na huge difference very fluffy very doughy very hearty let's keep going mmm\nwow this is really satisfying my taste buds in all the right ways guys as you\ncan see it is very fluffy on the inside and I'm a huge fan of fluffy pizza dough\nlike this I really love really doughy garlic knots this is really a step in\nthat right direction as far as I'm concerned and I do like the fact that\nthe garlic is popping pretty nicely as well with a little bit of cheddar coming\nup in the back end it's really more for presentation but I do like the way it\nlooks and I love the way it tastes I swear these are almost like croissants\nthe way they're rolled but they're super hearty super chewy and I'm just diggin'\nit mmm all right so what do you say go for\na little dip in the ranch I mean how bad can toasted bread be in some of this\nranch goodness right and with the ranch looking as thick as this does right now\nI've got super high hopes this flavor's gonna be pretty insane the cheddar is\ncaramelized on top of each of these knots guys so that can only mean really\nreally good things for your taste buds because it's nice and crispy nice and\ncrunchy and when you add it with ranch like this this has gotta be good it's\njust gotta be let me confirm it for you real fast confirmed god that is really\ninsane it really is the garlic and the cheddar and that doughy bread is such a\nridiculously tasty combination mmm so good I think I'm gonna kill this box\nbefore I get home this is ridiculously good\nmmm let me give you one more shot of these garlic cheddar knots guys if you\ncan get these right out of the oven I think you are gonna be an absolute\nheaven especially if you like caramelized cheese the way I do the way\nthe crispiness on the edges really goes with everything else is insane on this\nas you can see on the very bottom those are gonna be the most flavorful bites\nright there whatever your dipping sauce of choice is just go for it these are\npretty tasty but naturally this is all just my opinion what do you guys\npersonally think of the garlic cheddar knots here at Papa John's is this\nsomething that you're looking forward to giving a shot if you're a fan of their\ngarlic knots already and if you've never had the garlic knots over here how\nenticing did this look to you right now drop those comments down below and\ndefinitely let me know and as for my overall rating I'm gonna have to give\nthe garlic cheddar knots here at Papa John's a very well-deserved 9 out of 10\nthis one definitely satisfied today and I mean how could it not it's toasted\nfluffy pizza dough sprinkled with garlic and a little bit of melted cheddar and\nwhile I definitely enjoyed these I only wish there was just a little bit more\ncheddar cheese on top because honestly guys you can never have too much of that\ncaramelized cheddar cheese goodness to go around and this one definitely was\nteasing me with the amount that it had but I loved it either way very very\ntasty give these a shot and those are my thoughts on the latest side item here\nPapa John's as we close out another episode of peep this out guys and like I\nalways say I've got brand new content every single week here on my channel so\nwhile you stay tuned for the next review coming real soon in the meantime stay\nfrosty hey I know it's just toasted bread but\nthis is deliciously tasty toasted bread and at the end of the day that's what\nyou want to know right is it gonna be worth your time\nI think this most definitely is alright guys until next time we'll talk to you\nsoon  ", "9TjUWnAK0cg": "this video is sponsored by squarespace here's a much easier much more reliable method for making a great pan pizza a pizza style pioneered in the american midwest and yes popularized by a global chain that rhymes with it's a glut they don't need my publicity you can absolutely use any pizza dough with this method but here's what i've been using for pan pizzas lately bread flour but all-purpose would be fine a cup to start with like 120 grams i actually put in a little too much you'll see half a teaspoon of salt maybe three grams two or three grams of sugar half a teaspoon and half a teaspoon of dry yeast a gram or two a little glug of olive oil maybe a couple of teaspoons and you don't have to do this but garlic powder inside the dough works great with a thick crust pizza in a thin crust too much of it would burn just a dash i'm only making one portion of dough here and instead of water i'm using milk pizza butt uses various powdered milk products in their crusts it makes for some very nice caramelly notes in the brown surface half a cup of milk some people say you got a scald milk before you use it in a yeast bread heating it to almost boiling deactivates enzymes or proteins in the milk that can interfere with the gluten and the rise i tried this dough with scalded milk and with milk straight from the fridge and i noticed absolutely no difference maybe because my milk is pasteurized i don't know i do know that i put in too much flour so more milk to balance it i think wet sticky doughs are better for pan pizza they bake up fluffier and when i'm kneading a tiny little ball of dough for just one pizza i kind of like to do it up in the air between my hands this is super easy you just kind of squish it and grind it between your palms it's oddly satisfying and it doesn't get the counter dirty let's see is it smooth and elastic enough that i can form a thin sheet without it tearing check form it into a smooth ball yeah i wish it was a little bit stickier but it's fine back into the bowl cover it up and let it rise for an hour or two this took two because my kitchen is super cold right now doubled in size you could absolutely do my normal thing where i put the dough straight in the fridge and let it ferment slowly for a few days that's good too but either way we're going to do a second rise in the pan i used to use cast iron for pan pizza but i have switched to my non-stick a 10 inch teflon pan with an oven safe handle you could use cast iron but i have found this makes it so much easier you'll see why just a little bit of olive oil in the pan too much and the pizza has a really fried taste to it just a dab and i do like to put some seasonings in this oil a little pinch of dried oregano basil chili flakes whatever you like and a tiny pinch of salt a little salt goes a long way here and then you just completely coat the pan this results in a distinct layer of flavor on the bottom of the pizza that is quite tasty heterogeneity and while my hands are still greasy i'll grab my dough ball and plop it in i used to stretch the dough first and then lay it in the pan i found it's easier to just mash it straight into the pan with my fingertips this also helps me to get a more even thickness throughout if you do traditional stretching up in the air the thick outer ring of dough you get tends to make all the sauce and cheese pool into the center with this style of pizza i'm stretching it up past the corner of the pan not because i want it up there but because i know this dough is going to contract before all is said and done so start wider than you want it i'll rub a thin layer of oil on top because it tastes good and because it'll keep this from drying out as it gets a second rise in the pan at least for a half an hour that really helps it bake up lighter and fluffier it tends to be kind of dense and doughy if you skip this second rise and while it's rising we can prep everything else for sauce i'm still on this particular make and model of canned tomatoes it's the best thing for pizza sauce i can find in u.s grocery stores when i can't find it i use another brand of crushed or ground tomatoes and i spike it with a little tomato paste for extra flavor i don't normally measure it but a third of a cup is perfect for a pan pizza this size imho here's my new favorite pizza herb marjoram smells like tea but tastes like oregano crossed with time maybe i'll also use some oregano and basil and a tiny pinch of sugar a little chili flakes black pepper and a dab of olive oil stir it all up and that's it if it looks like not quite enough sauce to me then it's probably exactly enough let's prep our cheese for new york style pizza i scour the earth for whole milk low moisture mozzarella but on my pan pizzas i've really been liking the part skim kind lately and this stuff is way easier to find it's got to be low moisture though that's an eight ounce block i'll use five or six ounces like 150 grams i miss the full fat flavor but the part skim kind just seems to brown better with this particular recipe and for that same reason i think it's particularly important to avoid pre-grated cheese for this the anti-clumping starch they put on the pre-grated stuff is particularly likely to burn with this method i'm gonna show you there we go and lastly i do like to put some grated parmesan over the sauce layer i suppose now's as good a time as any to admit that i prefer the pre-grated stuff for pizza i have real parmigiano-reggiano in the fridge right now i could use it but it just doesn't taste right on pizza to me the fake stuff tastes right to me last thing to prep is my topping whatever toppings you want are fine but this is my new favorite pizza topping a tiny clove of fresh garlic tiny because we're going to eat it raw and raw garlic is super strong just a couple little shavings of lemon zest the bright yellow part with as little of the underlying white pith as possible and then a little bunch of fresh parsley chop it all up and you've got gremolata the traditional last minute garnish for lots of italian dishes chopping those three ingredients into each other really does seem to spark a chemical reaction between them the result tastes like more than the sum of its parts a last minute sprinkling of that makes all kinds of things taste fresher and i don't know more sophisticated okay the dough has visibly puffed up a bit so we're ready to bake you can simply top your dough and then throw the whole pan into a screaming hot oven that's traditional but what i do is a lot more energy efficient it's easier to control and it gets you a much browner bottom heat on medium and at the same time i'll get my oven's broiler heating to max that's the element at the top of the oven it heats up in a flash and i've got a rack positioned pretty close to it after a minute i can see the dough puffing up and after four minutes i can smell it starting to brown with my old method i would start topping the pizza now but the way i cook it these days is to completely finish browning the bottom before anything else goes in you do it this way and you can use a soft spatula to lift up the dough and see exactly what's going on with the non-stick pan you can just kind of shake it like an omelette to make sure it's not stuck and you can move it or rotate it around if some parts seem to be browning more than others with my old method you'd have to guess when the bottom is perfect with this method there's no guessing you just cook it until you like the bottom i like it just starting to burn a little burning is part of what makes bread taste like pizza to me and there we are so off the heat this comes now there's no particular rush i'll just smooth my sauce around edge to edge no bare ring of crust around the edge the stuff on the sides of the pan will caramelize and go super sweet dust on a little parmesan or whatever you want to call this substance it really enhances the flavor and hiding it under the mozzarella layer keeps it from burning again edge to edge with the mutts those bits of cheese touching the sides of the pan are going to do magical things that's it and under the grill this goes brits call it a grill i find this pizza cooks much better and faster if i keep my oven door closed yes people say you should not put teflon under the broiler it could overheat and put off toxic fumes good advice but this is only going to be under there for literally two minutes i've done tests with my infrared thermometer the exposed teflon never got remotely close to the temperature at which ptfe starts to break down causing polymer fume fever in very high doses it never got close if you can't risk it or if you have a pet bird around use cast iron birds are super sensitive to polymer fumes but i'm super sensitive to pizza fumes and this smells awesome you just pull it when it's brown to your liking look at that crispy cheese on the edge and because i use the non-stick pan it's going to come right off i'll sprinkle on my gremolata you want to let this cool in the pan for just a few minutes just until it's solidified enough that you can get it out intact the sooner you get it out to a cooling rack the crispier the bottom will be and look with a non-stick you can literally just slide the pizza out like an omelet couldn't be easier now that it's on the rack where steam can escape you're safe to let this cool as long as you want before eating i like to let it cool way down hey look up there you can see that super dark and even brown bottom but it's got nothing i ain't seen before though there's no surprises here i always hated my old method where you just had to guess when the bottom was perfect though say it's not perfect maybe you didn't get out of the pan fast enough and now it's soggy you can very easily just re-fry this for a few minutes basically until you hear it start to sizzle again that'll bring the crust right back to life i've said in the past that i don't think pizza cutters are good for the home kitchen i prefer using a knife because a pizza cutter just tends to fall right off the edges of your little cutting board but with a pizza this small in diameter it's fine cut yours however you want i like small slices because they are so thick and so rich the milk has made that crust a little bit cakey in an awesome way that is just such a great guilty pleasure pie and look at the rim those delicious brown cheesy bits that actually has an italian name frico it deserves its own name

from bakeries in taiwan and singapore and malaysia and such where these people cut these cakes the size of toddler beds and when the knife goes in the cake kind of goes it is transfixing i had to have one and the only way that was going to happen is if i baked it myself so here's my recipe it's really just a simple sponge cake called castella portuguese traders introduced it to japan in the 16th century as near as i can tell the more popular version in japan these days has cheese in it this does not this version seems to be more associated with taiwan it's just a simple egg sponge baked on the scale of a toddler bed the first thing you'll need is a cake pan and then you'll need a bigger one because we're going to bake this thing in a water bath that right there could work but the cake would not go wubba wubba very much when you cut it too much rigid surface relative to its pudding like inner mass the pan's just too small too short especially i want to bake in this tall sided pan that i've got those walls are three inches almost eight centimeters so what can i put this inside my big roasting tray where i do my thanksgiving turkey just barely fits use whatever pans you've got you could probably use those big disposable aluminum ones if you wanted i worked out a simple formula for calibrating the recipe to any pan's dimensions it's in the description math is your friend now i'm going to pour some water in here doesn't have to be hot yet we're just testing to see how much the inner pan is going to displace it looks to me like those jiggly cake bakeries in taiwan and such use steam injection ovens best way to simulate that at home is by baking in a water bath you'll see what it does the inner pan is floating i'll push it down a little bit but honestly it'll probably still float with the batter in it this cake is mostly air the water does not have to come all the way up the sides now the inner pan can come out and i'll load that into the oven rather than trying to pour hot water into the oven later we can just let that heat up with the oven i baked a dozen of these damn cakes in a weekend and found 325 fahrenheit to be the winning temperature in my oven that's 160c and i'm not using my convection fan i find the fan makes the top of the cake crack now you're going to need a huge bowl and another huge bowl time for the batter and when i studied all the castella recipes i could find it became obvious that the varying ingredient quantities i observed all kind of orbit around the same simple whole number proportions i think this must have been the mother recipe it's by weight four parts eggs to one part fat one part milk one part flour and one part sugar i'm not saying all the recipes do that but they all seem to be doing slight variations of that and i think it's a great place to start my pan is 432 square inches so according to my little formula we're going to need 20 eggs yes 20. the mass of this cake is literally half egg and we need to separate the white from the yolk i normally do that by passing the yolk between the two sides of the shell but in every one of these jiggly cake videos from the bakeries i see people unloading all the eggs whole into a big bowl and then going in with their hands to separate out the yolks you can just kind of pass it between your hands and eventually the white will slither out between your fingers put the yolk into the other giant bowl this works but here's the catch if you rupture one and i need just one of these yolks and some of the yellow leaks down into the bowl with all the whites you will have just wasted all of these eggs we need to beat the whites and their proteins won't foam up if there's any fat in the bowl the yolk has a ton of fat i do not understand why the manager of a castella bakery would trust their employees with this procedure i would totally have them separate the eggs one at a time in a separate bowl keeping each white quarantined until it's clean god burst one get it away get it away i'm sweating luckily that's not a problem thanks to the sponsor of this video native deodorant whom i'll now briefly thank it sounds kind of funny but if a chef were to make deodorant i'm pretty sure native is what they'd come up with look at these scents coconut and vanilla herbal citrus cucumber mint that one's my favorite for sure i love cucumber in just about anything my wife has been on me about switching to an aluminum free deodorant for a long time aluminum salts plug up your pores that's how they work but that has caused me some problems that i won't describe in detail in a food video woe is me the shilling in the armpit that's a little joke for you history buffs anyway lauren's used native for years the scents are super classy they sort of remind me of cocktails in a good way especially that citrus one tons of scents to choose from and they last all day long even in a hot kitchen they're also vegan and cruelty free three deodorants are normally 36 dollars but if you use my link and code in the description you'll get them for 24. that's 33 off link and code in the description thank you native now we've got 20 eggs separated if we look at our mother proportions we can calculate how much we need of everything else a typical large chicken egg minus its shell weighs about 50 grams 50 times 20 eggs is a kilo a thousand grams of eggs all the other ingredients should weigh one quarter of that right so we need 250 grams of fat in the yolks some people apparently use melted butter that'd have nice flavor but vegetable oil will get you a softer texture and i think this cake is entirely about the texture oil is what i see the pros using in the videos time for the milk 250 grams of milk now for 250 of flour all-purpose flour would probably be fine but most people seem to use cake flour and i think that makes sense cakes built on egg foams can sometimes be a little tough so it makes sense to use a softer flour now there are some small additions that are not covered by the macro formula a lot of recipes call for a little cornstarch and i think it's good it makes the interior crumb of the cake finer more pudding like i'd use like a tenth of the weight of your flour so i put in 25 grams a giant glug of vanilla though the easiest way to play with different flavors here would be to put in different extracts maybe do some orange extract plus some orange food coloring whatever and then salt i would do like a heaped teaspoon for this much that apparently works out to half a gram of salt per egg if you want to know last thing we need to measure is our sugar into a separate bowl and this is where i deviate from the mother formula a bit i've gotten a glossier top on the cake when i use a little more than one part sugar what is that 270 grams okay i lied one more thing to measure a little cream of tartar into the egg whites acids make egg foams more elastic and thus more able to mix with other ingredients without deflating some people say it's a quarter teaspoon for every four egg whites some people say it's twice that i don't think you need to be exact and you don't have to use cream of tartar a lot of people use a little lemon juice or white vinegar instead then we'll just beat this up into a foam not in a million years would i make this cake without some kind of electric mixer took about five minutes to get it that fluffy we don't have stiff peaks or anything yet that's fine we're not done yet in goes like half the sugar and we'll beat this until it goes noticeably firmer and glossier some people mix the sugar in with the whites from the start but that can keep your foam from ever forming it's safer to mix in the sugar gradually at the end the sugar will significantly strengthen the foam at this stage make it way firmer you can see how i've got like medium peaks now peaks that flop over when i've taken it all the way to stiff peaks with the sugar in it i've gotten cakes that puff up more in the oven but the top cracks more if that matters to you now we just go right into the other ingredients just blast it with the mixer until it's really smooth some people apparently sift all their dry ingredients into the bowl i see no point the mixer is going to smooth everything out don't worry you're not going to develop the gluten and make the cake tough we're using cake flour and there's hardly even any of it in there the structural matrix of this cake is egg not wheat now i'm just going to start stirring in my meringue it's easier if you do it in a couple installments you might have it in your head that you need to gently fold in the egg foam lest you deflate it but you'd never be able to get a homogeneous mixture here through folding there's just too much meringue it's more meringue now than cake twisted and evil i'm just mixing that until i don't see any streaks of yellow anymore i've seen people in the taiwanese bakery straight up whip these together in a stand mixer and their cakes still come out like pillows only reason i'm using a spatula is because i'd have to totally submerge my hand mixer to keep using it in here all right time for the pan and you've gotta line your pan with parchment paper sponge cakes are both sticky and delicate a deadly combination when it comes to extracting something from a pan how you line yours will depend on the dimensions of your cake and your roll of parchment but i've got a couple of little strips for the two sides and one big one down the middle with enough excess on either side that i can use it as a sling later to lift the cake out don't worry if things are collapsing or not lying flat the weight of the batter will hold everything down this batter came out particularly thin i think that has more to do with how stiff i beat the meringue as opposed to any of the other ingredient proportions but i definitely find i get a smoother more attractive top with a thinner batter there look i didn't even have to smooth that out with a spatula in this goes to the water bath and you'll probably have to just drop the pan in which will result in a little splash but that's fine an initial burst of steam in the oven will probably be good for the cake you bake a cake in a water bath for two reasons one is to create a steam environment in there that will keep the top from setting up hard and restricting the upward expansion of the cake the other reason for the water bath is to keep the sides of the cake from overcooking water can get no hotter than its boiling point and 212 fahrenheit or 100c is well below the temperature needed to brown anything the water will keep the sides of the cake pan relatively cool a smaller castella might need an hour this needed an hour and a half before it looked ready to test by poking it with a skewer nope still too wet on the inside look at the crumbs clinging to the skewer if you're afraid your top is going to burn before the inside is done you can always just turn the heat down or turn it up if the top isn't browning fast enough like 10 minutes later there we are skewer comes out clean time to lift this out and i see no reason to unload a giant pan of hot water right now i'd say just turn off the oven and come back for it when it's cool in the bakery videos they turn the cakes out by inverting them onto a big cutting board but ours is only the size of a couch cushion not a toddler bed so we can simply grab the ends of the big parchment piece and sling the cake out without folding it over on itself and breaking it or anything we can pull all the paper off now note how light the sides are if we didn't bake it in the water bath they'd be very brown come on man look at that it just looks like the airplane seat that you can use as a flotation device in the unlikely event of a water landing look at it jiggle time for the big moment and you'll want the longest knife you have they have these crazy long ones at the bakeries that whoops right there that's what happens when you don't have a long enough knife so obviously it looks awesome and it feels awesome but does it taste awesome honestly when you eat it while it's still very warm i think it kind of tastes like farts remember it's half egg and eggs have sulfur in them that taste really does go away though as the cake cools i don't know if it's the sulfur off-gassing or breaking down or what but the cooled cake does taste nice i do think this is mostly about the novelty value of making something so springy and pillowy how much of it is air well i can show you precisely how much those hydraulic press videos are my second favorite sub-genre of oddly satisfying youtube videos the first of course being jiggly cake cutting you can make this taste more interesting by putting in different flavorings or some chunks like chocolate chips people do that maybe we'll try that another time but for now let's just revel in this simple pleasure wubba wubba wubba", "0hxptu-dG6M":

the best cauli rice you're gonna try okay it's not gonna be mushy it's gonna be nice and fluffy and airy okay so let me show you what we're starting off with um this is just a little bag of frozen cauli rice so this is already riced um and it's yeah frozen so what we're going to do here is we are going to i'm going to show you just how simple it is to make this is you know a super easy recipe so we're gonna microwave this um to get it nice and soft and then i will show you the next step because there is a step before you start cooking it that i use that makes my rice super fluffy and i think that's kind of like the trick so let's go ahead and microwave this for three minutes and then i will show you the next step okey dokey so now oh it's already dripping i have to clean that after so here we have our cauli rice and basically we're going to cut a little edge here let me show you so we're going to cut a little that was probably a little bigger than i should have cut so usually you want to cut just like a little corner little baby corner and then because you're going to fold it over like this grab a kitchen towel something that because obviously this is really hot right now but it does need to be hot in order for all the water to come out so then you're just going to squeeze it excuse my mess back here all the water will start coming out just make sure you get a thick

diced carrots very small half of a small onion diced one large stock of celery diced two cups of mashed cauliflower drained really well i actually stick it in a pot and keep cooking it afterwards to get the moisture out and then we have one cup of almond flour one egg one large spring onion chopped and a cup and a half packed tightly of crab meat and i use um this one i get it at costco it's really good the meat is really good and it tastes good not like the other crappy stuff you get in the store and then we have a teaspoon of starch old bay seasoning half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of garlic one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of parsley what are you doing okay that was weird anywho we're going to get started so we're going to fry up the onions the celery just to soften it up and the carrot in a pan with some butter or oil whatever you choose we're just going to let that simmer for a little bit and then we're going to work on this part so in the almond flour we're going to dump in the corn starch old bay seasoning garlic powder salt and the parsley and we're just going to give that a little bit of a stir mix that up okay and then we're going to stir in the mashed

bakers, John Connell\nfrom Preppy Kitchen here, and today we're making these\neasy, breezy roasted tomatoes that will blow your mind. They're prefect for\ntopping pastas, pizzas, the options are neatly endless. You can also just eat\nthem right off the pan with your fingers like I've been doing. Let's get started. My recipe calls for two and a half pounds of Roma tomatoes, but I\nhappen to have a bunch of Campari tomatoes and\na couple other ones sort of just hanging out in the fridge, so I'm gonna put them all together. This is a waste not want not situation, and they'll work fine. Gonna give them a wash and then cut them in half over a bowl, just use your fingers and squeeze out some of that liquid and the seeds. We wanna end up Squeeze it out. (laughs) We wanna end up with a nice reservoir to hold in all the flavors we're going to be packing in. Repeat that process until all of your tomatoes are prepped and ready. (upbeat music) Our tomatoes are halved and the juices are all squeezed out. This is so good for cooking, so don't throw it away. Promise me. It's gonna be amazing in any sauce. Lets get our backing pan and arrange all the tomatoes cut side up. These roasted tomatoes\nare gonna be so delicious, and you'll enjoy them cold, warmed up. You can add them to your favorite recipe, or have them in a salad, eat them alone as a side dish. Setting that aside now, and we're gonna slice up some shallots. Chop off the tops and\nbottoms of some shallots. And, we're gonna peel the skin off so it's just that beautiful\npurple underneath. Any parts that you see turning papery, those can get discarded as well. They will not be delicious. (knife hitting cutting board) As you slice them up just place them onto your baking sheet next to the tomatoes. I love using shallots in my salad dressings. They are so delicious,\nvery similar to onions, but a little but milder. Do you ever watch my videos and try and piece together which ones ones I shot on the same day? It's a fun puzzle. (laughs) You have to watch the bowl of fruit and watch the gingham shirt\nand how long my hair is. One more bit of prep, we're gonna be popping a whole garlic clove into each of those tomatoes. (metal swipes board) Just trimming the bottom off of each of these garlic cloves, and then we're gonna\ngive them a good smash and pop them in. A nice smash helps to take that skin off and also releases a lot of oils. Once it's smashed just pop it in. And, for this batch you'll\nprobably be using most of two heads of garlic. So, be forewarned, (metal hits counter) and buy ahead. If you have a giant clove of garlic you can split it up into two so its more manageable, especially if you're tomatoes\nare on the smaller side. Can anyone tell me why\ngarlic juice is so sticky? I know why it's stinky,\nbut why is it so sticky? It drives me crazy. (hands rubbing together) Okay, it looks all of my\ntomatoes are covered, nice. We've set the scene\nfor some serious magic, so lets sprinkle this\nwith three tablespoons-ish of olive oil. Just make sure everything is getting at least a sprinkle,\nespecially those garlics. So, I'm using a heavy\nMediterranean tablespoon (laughs) with my olive oil. I feel like every single recipe lies about how much oil and butter\nto use, just buy the buy. Now, we're gonna sprinkle this\nwith about two tablespoons of a Balsamic or a red wine vinegar. This is a nice aged\nBalsamic, so it's gonna be a much more controlled sprinkle. So beautiful. Now it's time for about the quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Just make sure it's evenly distributed. I'm using about two teaspoons\nof Herbes de Provence. But, you can really use any herb mixture that you enjoy. It's raining herbs. (upbeat music) Add some pepper, as much as you'd like. (pepper grinder grinding) And, we're finishing this off with some freshly chopped fresh thyme. One of my favorite herbs. All this will take these tomatoes from bland to blam! (laughs) These will go into the oven at 375 for about 50 minutes. This is actually amazing as a side dish. It could be like a perfect buffet item. If you wanted to freeze it, pop it into a very heavy\nduty resealable bag, squeeze the air out. It's good for a few\nmonths, maybe up to six. If you wanna put it in\nthe fridge, same deal, good for a week. Really nice to pop onto pizzas, top your pastas with them, or you can just blend it\nup into a pasta sauce. This can be served in a beautiful tray. If you're doing that add\nsome little fresh basil. It'll give you some visual interest, and basil and tomato is just delicious. I'll be taste testing one for you. That is like candy, my gosh. That's really good. Just make this, make it now, make it often. You are gonna love it. Bookmark the recipe on PreppyKitchen.com Mm!

right of the screen to take it directly to the recipe page and i'll be doing the patreon and paypal shout out a little later in the video and with that out of the way let's get on with today's recipe right i'll start the recipe by making the pastry now i'll be using my food processor to make my pastry it's much better and quicker this way but you can make it by hand if you wish i go into a lot more detail in my chicken and mushroom pie video there'll be a link to that recipe in the description box under the video or just click on the i icon top right of your screen okay that's the 340 grams or 12 ounces of plain or all-purpose flour plus the salt in the machine next to go in is the 85 grams that's three ounces of butter and the same amount of lard or shortening and make sure everything is cold when you're making pastry now i'll pulse the machine for a few seconds until it resembles fine breadcrumbs right because i've had a few comments about some people experiencing cracking in the pastry and replacing some of the water with one large well-beaten egg that should solve that problem okay set your machine away and slowly add the 60 ml of water once the pastry starts riding around the machine it's done and i'm showing this in real time so you can see it doesn't take that long at all about 15 seconds [Music] and there it goes and that's it the pastries made and if your measurements were correct at the beginning you should have around 620 grams or 22 ounces so i'll divide it into two one at 320 grams for the base of the pie and the other at 300 grams for the top [Music] okay i'll get that wrapped in cling film or you can use plastic food bags and get it into the fridge for at least 30 minutes before using it you can make this well in advance though [Music] and this is the pie tin i'll be using and as you can see it's 23 centimeters that's 9 inches by 2.5 centimeters or one inch deep [Music] now it needs to be greased i'm using a little lard to do mine but you can use butter or shortening once it's done i like to keep mine in the fridge until it's needed okay onto the filling and you can make this well in advance too to a large pan turn on the heat and add the two tablespoons of olive oil and bring it up to temperature once your oil is hot add the diced onions [Music] now fry the onions until they start to go translucent once your onions reach that point you can add your chopped garlic closely followed by your black pepper and salt now give that a good stir once they're all mixed together you can add your diced chicken and as you can see i've diced the chicken into smallish pieces now mix all that together [Music] once the chickens mixed with the onions you can add your spices in this little ball i have hot chili powder turmeric and garam masala or you can just add the total amount in ordinary curry powder if you wish but i like to make my own up with these three simple spices right now you can turn up the heat a bit and start cooking the chicken until it starts to release its juices this should take around four minutes but you need to keep stirring once it gets to this point as you can see in the pan it's time to add your water and cream mixture and bring that to a boil [Music] at this point i like to add a small bunch of chopped coriander but that's optional now bring that to a simmer and once it starts simmering it's time to add the thickening agent you can use homemade roux if you know how to do it but i like to use cornflour you may know that as cornstarch dissolved in cold water right i'll pour that in and give it a good mix until it's completely thickened as shown right turn off the heat and allow it to completely cool before it goes into the pie a little tip we used to use in our kitchens is if you want to cool something really quickly float the pan in a sink of cold water and that should bring the temperature down in about 30 minutes time to start rolling the pastry first thing to do is dust the bench and the pin with flour [Music] if you're not familiar with rolling pastry this is something you need to practice at to get a feel for it the only thing i'll suggest is roll backwards and forwards in straight lines and turn the pastry 90 degrees [Music] once the pastry becomes too big to turn then turn the pin 90 degrees that should keep the pastry reasonably round make sure you tuck the pasty right down into the corners of the tin a little tip here for those with long fashionable nails make yourself a little ball of pastry dip it in flour and use that to push down into the corners right i'll put that aside for a minute and quickly go through rolling out the top pastry for the pie [Music] okay that's the top ready to go time to make up the egg wash for this recipe you only need a small egg and a dash of milk as shown and give that a good whisk i've been asked many times if i'm going to get these little mini egg stroke coffee whisks in the website shop i have been able to get hold of some so if you want one grab one quick while they're there but they do come in handy for many applications around the kitchen right i'll set that aside until i need it before going any further preheat your oven to 170 celsius at 340 fahrenheit or gas mark 3. right my filling is completely cooled so i'll start putting the pie together first i'll fill the base with the filling try to dome the mixture so the middle is slightly higher than the edges once that's done brush your egg wash all around the rim of the pie [Music] now unroll the top pastry over the top of the pie [Music] lightly press down the two pieces together [Music] now using your four fingers and thumbs like this crimp all around the edges of the pie or you can use the tines of a fork and press all the way around the edge that leaves a nice pattern too [Music] once that's done you cut off the excess pastry but don't waste it you can wrap this and keep the excess pastry in your freezer it'll always go towards the base of your next pie right give the whole top surface of the pie a good court of the egg wash and once that's done you need to give it a few vent holes i like to use a fork as shown or you can cut three or four slits in the center of the pie it's entirely up to you [Music] okay get it into the preheated oven and set your timer for 35 minutes and at this point i hope you don't mind if i give my two recipe books a bit of a plug the books have lots of our favorite easy to follow recipes from our work kitchens in them both books are available in the website shop along with lots of other equipment i use in the videos and by popular demand the skeleton style oven gloves are now available too just click on the eye icon top right of your screen and that will take you directly to the website shop once the time's up check that your pie is golden brown if it's not just give it an extra five minutes mine's done and looking and smelling amazing so i let it sit on a wire rack for about 15 minutes then i'll come back and see what it's like out of the tin and have a little taste of course right it's still pretty hot but i can't wait any longer the smell is driving me nuts if you're making one of these in these handy pie or flan tins with the removable bottom you can serve the pie from the base of it you can even use some of your excess turkey for this dish ideal for boxing or new year's day lunch or any other time of the year to be honest and that just looks amazing the pastry is nicely done including the bottom the chicken looks perfectly cooked and succulent you can even add a few veggies if you wanted to and here we go and that is so good you really have to try this one [Music] the whole family will enjoy this young and old and it definitely gets a big thumbs up and

gives a beautiful sweetness to the cookie and the bite size you can literally just pop one in your mouth [Music] hi and welcome to cookwood now if you are returning welcome back if you are new here please consider subscribing and hit that notification bell so you know when we posted a new recipe today we have got such a cute recipe for you keto thumbprint cookies they are bite-sized and you know you can just pop one in your mouth i also show you how to make sugar-free jam let's get into that recipe now first we're going to add six tablespoons of butter softened to a bowl [Music] and two thirds of a cup of powdered sweetener now you know from our previous videos if you've just got granular sweetener you just grind it in a blender and then we are going to cream the butter and the sweetener together look at that that is pretty good next we're going to add one teaspoon of organic vanilla bean paste and blend that in as well next crack in an egg and your egg needs to be at room temperature just stir until it's fully combined now we're going to add in two cups of almond flour quarter teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of baking powder and mix that all together this will go much quicker if you are using a mixing machine however i am not using a mixing machine today because i want everyone to be able to bake these thumbprint cookies and look it's come together really nicely you're looking for a sticky dough that's quite firm beautiful and that's it for the dough and now you're going to align your baking sheet with parchment paper and set your oven to 325 fahrenheit or 162 degrees celsius and now we are ready to form our cookie balls if you like we're going to roll them into balls and the size that you want is a tablespoon so i'm going to show you how i'm going to measure that and they're all going to come out the same first you're going to add and stuff your your tablespoon and then you're going to wet your hands remove the dough roll it into a ball and add it to your parchment paper or baking sheet okay i'm just going to keep going with this and i'll get back to you soon right that was fun rolling all of these out and now we are going to do an even more fun part to make them thumbprint cookies you are going to press your thumb into the middle of each cookie ball with a wedge finger so you literally press you might ask but why are we doing the smell well a little bit of sugar-free jam is gonna go in the middle it's gonna end up being about a quarter to a half teaspoon if they crack if yours crack all i'm gonna do is just pat them a little if you're bothered by it i'm not bothered by it but i'm just going to show you which with thumb of course and i'm just going to dab that a little bit just to close up and just be very gentle and then i'm gonna keep going with it [Music] i don't mind mine like this though so i might not touch the others i'm smiling because these are so cute now you know you've made holes with your thumbs into your little cookie dough that is where our sugar free jam will go so let's make some jam and you can use this recipe for whenever you want to have something a little bit sweet you know on the you know whatever bread you use we have a bread available and here's the link to our bread if you don't if you haven't found a great bread i'll bring a 0.5 total carbs per slice and if you want to try it so let's make that jam now for the sugar-free jam you're going to set your banana to medium and we have a small stainless steel pot here and our ingredients are going to be a teaspoon of lemon juice a tablespoon of sweetener and let's talk about the fruit that you're allowed on keto we only use berries um avocado is considered a fruit by the way so that's we're not using that but we're using berries i've got a range of mixed berries but you can stick to one berry like you know if you love strawberry jam you can use that so we are going to use a quarter cup of berries so you're going to have a quarter cup of just the berries and up to three quarters of a cup like this filled with water so i've got my quarter cup of berries in there and the juice of berries or water if you're using fresh we are also going to strain our jam just of the seeds and you know any solids if you like about a texture in your gym don't skip this part and we're also going to blend it so i've got my nutribullet out add your berries and your water to your pot tablespoon of sweetener and a teaspoon of lemon juice and now you're going to whisk that together and just keep whisking until your jam thickens or the mixture thickens and try to also mash up your berries mine are quite meshed because they were frozen and then defrosted now you can see my mixture is thickening up quite nicely and as it's been heating up the water has been evaporating and then creating this syrup and also i've just been smashing it like that as it's been heating up i'm happy with this now and also i am not gonna strain mine because i love a bit of texture in my jam so now i'm going to blend it i'm really happy with the way this came out it's just the right thickness and it smells fantastic that's ready now and now we need a quarter teaspoon per cookie of sugar-free jam [Music] look at these beautiful cookies they look gorgeous and now they're ready to go in the oven 325 fahrenheit or 162 degrees celsius for 12 to 14 minutes now these are fresh out of the oven they're still pretty soft so do let them cool but look up it's so pretty oh my goodness yet again i had lots of fun making these beautiful keto thumbprint cookies i hope you do get to try it thank you so much for watching stay safe and be well", "MqAntK1V-1g": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] there's [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] this [Music]", "4t794-YygO8": "hey guys and I hope you're having a great day we have something extremely exciting for you we have some lamb shanks you can really go any seasonings just throw it in like with some broth put it in the oven for like three hours and it's good to go but we thought it'd be fun to mix it up and have a curry lamb shank that's slow roasted in the oven here we have our two lamb shanks you can tell that they're extremely muscular and a lot of tendon in there which I feel like when you see a meat like that you just know don't cut it off the bone like you want to slow roast this meat whether it's on the stove or in the oven so what we're going to do first thing is we're going to get a great Brown sear on these guys and then pull them out of the Dutch oven we'll be cooking in we're going to cook in this guy so if you don't have one of these that's totally fine any pot or like pan you can cover with foil could go in the oven with these so once we get the sear on these we're going to toss in a mixture of Indian spices we've put together and then we're going to also add some diced up onion and some minced garlic so if you don't want to go the route of putting all the spices together that's totally fine you can just go with curry powder this is really simple just curry powder the onion the garlic and you've got yourself any curry recipe you want so what we have on the menu for you guys is some slow low stood fall-off-the-bone lamb shank curry that we're going to make in the oven for about two to three hours and we're also going to show you how to make some Indian on some garlic naan so we'll show you how to get all that done and we'll see you back in a little bit I'm going to add about a tablespoon of ghee to the of Dutch oven you can also use coconut oil if that's what you have at home once you can tell the pan is hot the oil will be smoking you can just add the lamb Shea straight to it [Music] so if you had a nice sear to all the sides you turn on turn down the heat and remove the lamb shanks and set them aside while you let the pan pull down you can start to dice up some onion 1/4 cup is probably pretty good add your seasoning mixture or your curry powder straight to the pan and just mix it around you want to start to smell all the spices and then add your onion and 2 TSP minced garlic at this point the spices should be extremely fragrant once everything starts to mix around I would place the lamb shanks back in and then we're going to add some beef broth so just add as much as it takes to halfway cover the shanks and if you have these never hurts to throw in a couple Bailey's so now we're going to cover this up and we're going to put it in the oven at 325 we'll check on it in about 45 minutes and maybe turn the shanks see how they're doing but it's going to be in the oven for a total of two and a half to three hours periodically checking on it so let's get these shanks in the oven and I am back to show you how to make our garlic none nan is an Indian bread usually used to scoop up some meat you can eat it on the side just it comes in garlic cheese there's a lot of variations you can make on none and then there's also roti and roti is like a thinner less doughy version of naan essentially I would say this is more of a hybrid but Matt would say it's not so we're just going to go with naan and you guys can put this to the test and let us know what you think is roti or is it none so we're going to start with 1/2 a cup of coconut flour to the coconut flour we are going to add a tablespoon and a half of psyllium husk powder this is a great source of fiber we always have some in the house then we are going to add a quarter teaspoon of baking powder and then we are going to add two tablespoons of coconut oil and mix it around so we tried this recipe before with just tossing in some minced garlic but the flavour didn't really come through so we are going to just mince up some raw garlic and this should be a lot stronger of a taste so you really get the garlic naan flavor ok that looks good to me so now we will add this you just give it a nice stir and now the secret to this is adding hot water so I don't really know the science behind it and I couldn't find it online to explain why the hot water makes such a difference in my mind but even growing up my mom always added hot water when making rotis or nons at home so we'll start with a cup of water and then you can always add water but you can't take away so we'll stir this you can already see it coming together you can go a little more add a little splash you can see it like comes together like an actual dough which is really nice okay so now once you've created your dough it should look like this you can't really go wrong we are going to just let this sit for ten minutes so the dough has been sitting for about ten minutes ten to fifteen minutes and it looks pretty similar to where we left it but right now we're just going to rip off a chunk so as big or small as you like now go about that size morph it together as best as possible it's not like normal dough so it's not going to like form a perfect circle what I like to do though is get a little coconut oil and grease on my hands and press it out a little and then put some parchment paper on top so you can really get it thin it's not as beautiful but you know it's still delicious [Music] and we're back with our lamb shanks look at how incredible they look as you can see the meat like inched up and now the bone is exposed so this is in the oven for exactly 2 hours and 45 minutes we checked on it about every 45 minutes and flipped the lamb shank and for the last 20 minutes we put it in the oven with the lid off and that helped reduce some of the sauce down so now we're actually going to pull the shanks out completely and we're going to reduce the sauce down so it's pickins up and creates a thick curry coating for the lamb as you can see it sickens up pretty quickly and if you like a thinner curry you don't have to reduce it at all you can just eat it directly after it's out of the oven for 2 hours and 45 minutes now it's perfect so now we are going to plate up and we will meet you at the dinner table [Music] we just took pictures and this is part of the picture but look at that bite and I didn't have it sorry I'm so excited I didn't even have to use a knife I just you stuck the fork in and it just pulled right off it's so tender right now so I'm going to try some of it ooh mmm just falls apart in your mouth and you know one thing I was planning on doing it first was rubbing the shanks in some like all the curry spices we'd used but that's not even necessary because the spices are so strong and when it's in the oven for as long as we put in the oven it just penetrates the meat so that goes for like most meats generally so this is like the spice the garam masala the coriander like you can hit all those notes just on your tongue it's so good I'm going to actually try with some none we have some leftover some curry on the side out of that mmm guys make this and it the best part about it is that it's super like pliable you're going to use it as a turkey you can just like shove a bunch of lamb curry in here and just use it like a taco does it get better an Indian taco guys we hope you love this recipe we hope you make the rotis let us know what's up are there any other

confident in uh what's gonna happen this evening people are treating this election like they're preparing for a hurricane everyone's boarding up windows and they're terrified they're going to lose power so who knows what's going to happen i just hope you all stay safe out there and if you're feeling stressed if you're feeling down i recommend getting in that anabolic kitchen and whipping something up always helps bring me back to center in today's video we'll be making an anabolic crispy fried chicken sandwich crispy juicy delicious anabolic if you've been wanting fried chicken but you don't want to look like you like fried chicken then give this recipe a shot i promise it just might change your life you already know that rjf anabolic cookbook has been updated this recipe's in there every other one of my recipes is right here handy little guide right in your pocket you get it one time you get every anabolic recipe for free if you've been trying to diet and you don't want to give up the foods you love then whoo this might just be all you need link in my description so if you guys are ready to get another epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Music] so the first step is getting our chicken ready now when you're air frying chicken the thinner it is the better so what we're going to do for this sandwich is weigh out some of these trim chicken breasts right here and i want to get 224 grams of chicken and i did pre-trim these and split a breast in half that way they're a little thinner it's going to cook better that way it's going to taste better but do however you want as long as you got 224 grams of chicken you're gonna be good now we need to get our breading for this chicken so i'm gonna set a mixing bowl on my food scale and i'm gonna toss in about 20 grams of plain white flour two grams of baking powder to make it extra crispy you definitely want that crisp on there a gram of paprika a gram of garlic powder a gram of black pepper and finally a gram of kosher salt and once those are all in here just go in with a spoon and mix everything together now that our breading is mixed up chicken's weighed out traditionally what you do when you bread chicken is use an egg wash well we don't want to use a full egg we don't want to add that fat although it doesn't add that many calories in general or really anything we're going to play it safe so we're just going to put some egg whites in a bowl you don't got to weigh these out we're barely going to use any of them it's not gonna affect the calories it might add like a gram of protein i don't know about you but i ain't counting that and now i'm gonna show you just how easy this is man take your chicken and we're gonna dip it in the egg whites just move it around let it get a nice little coating once it's coated let it drip off a little bit and move it over to your breading bowl sit it down in here flip it around let it get as covered as you possibly can in our breading any nooks crannies or crevices make sure you get them all man this chicken should literally be covered from head to chicken toe and once your chicken's breaded it should be fully covered and you're gonna sit it on a separate plate [Music] and once your chicken is fully breaded you want to make sure that it crisps up so what we're gonna do is hit each side of it with a light coating of non-stick spray hit a little boom little bone flip them over boom now it's time to air fryer chicken what i'm using is a ninja foodie the exact link to this model in my description box if you're curious but it's got a little basket most air fryer's got these baskets if not you can really use whatever air fryer this one's a basket one for reference i'm just gonna hit it with a light coating of zero calorie spray and i'm gonna take my chicken pieces and set them right down in here make sure you got a little room between them they're not touching they're gonna crisp up even better that way and just for reference we got the two pieces of chicken right down in there and all i'm gonna do is set the temp to 400 and we're gonna cook about 14 to 16 minutes in total but you want to do even time each side so i'll start with seven minutes on one side we'll do seven on the other and see how we go and boom all right look at this baby round one right look at how that's looking you see that can you hear that sizzling you all just need to learn to start trusting me man this is a game changer so now to go in give her a flipping flipping oh man close her up and it's really only gonna need about seven more minutes let's go chicken is done but first guys we gotta go over bun selection and real quick a little thermometer like this is great to tell if your chicken is done when it's breaded you don't always know you can use this bad boy stick it in the chicken as long as this has 175 degrees in the middle you're good to go man that's how you don't overcook it you keep it juicy thumbs up for pro tips bun selection i'm using nature's own butter buns not for any particular reason other than they are only 140 calories a piece read those nutrition labels get the lowest calorie one you can find you're gonna be way better off that way so i'm gonna set one of my buns out right yeah and then for a simple low-calorie secret sauce hack man i got fat-free ranch i'm gonna put some right here on the top along with a little splash of sriracha for some kick then i'll just go in with a spoon kind of mix it up on this top bun here and spread her out and now i'm just going to take my chicken and lay it right on here like so and then slap that top bun on and boom this is the anabolic crispy fried chicken sandwich you can't tell me this isn't

higher in protein lower in calories you'd have no idea you'd drive through and get another one because of how good this one is this is one that like i beg you to try everybody loves fried chicken everybody loves a chicken sandwich if you have had no faith in me as a recipe designer this entire time this one might be the one that gets you on board oh my goodness all right we're losing this one but just to show you you learned how to make chicken strips at the same time that's worth a thumbs up if i've ever seen it this tastes like i'm cheating on my diet what this is what this tastes like i'm cheating on my diet answer me this how do we fail on our diets when we're eating things like this we don't got to deprive ourselves we're not waking up and having a quinoa bowl with some berries we ain't doing none of that goofy stuff man we're eating the foods we love the foods we grew up eating that we ate for some of us 20 30 40 years of our lives and all of a sudden we're supposed to do this hard pivot and all that stuff that made life so enjoyable we got to give up regardless of the issues we face in this country i think that's the most important one man we gotta eat the foods we love and with this diet with these recipes that is exactly what we're doing without secret sauce little concoction two-step hack just game changer normally on these sandwiches they're loading it down with mayo lots of calories lots of fat this way we were able to maybe put 10 or 15 calories of sauce on it but loads of flavor and the breading and the chicken you don't even need sauce the pepper the paprika the salt it just the crunchiness it just adds this nice little flavor without once again having to deep fry adding unnecessary calories that we don't need we get straight to the point man you ever have someone tell you a story but they start like five years earlier and it took 20 minutes to get to the main point we're not doing that here we're getting straight to the meat of the situation yeah that's money right there man that is pure money i gotta shave a bite for the end i made the whole thing right now in the entire chicken sandwich bun and all the meat flavor if you make it exactly what you just saw what you end up with is the entire sandwich you have 432 calories only 4 grams of fat 57 grams of protein 42 grams of carbs 2 grams of fiber 57 grams of protein little over 400 calories i don't know the nutrition facts for popeyes if you do put them in the comment section below but i bet it's double this gotta be and it's less protein hmm and i'd put this up against it i really would i would put this right next to it and although popeyes might be just because it's so bad for you and so much fat might be slightly better but if popeyes is a 10 this is a 9.5 real talk you got to make this one if you don't have an air fryer they're cheap nowadays man you don't got to buy a fancy one like i got get a cheap one give her a try you're not going to be disappointed final bite um wow i could seriously eat those all day dang 10 out of 10 a plus you got to make it tag me on instagram let me know how it's doing for you and if you add me to your story i'll re-add you to

and this cake here believe it or not is actually microwavable [Music] [Music] let's go ahead and get started with our heart-shaped strawberries so this is really i mean of course they don't have to be heart-shaped but doesn't that look so much cuter it does so we cut off the little tail and now we're going to do a little v a little v okay so it's gonna look something like that and then you just kind of round off the little tips just kind of try to make you just kind of round off the edges so that it looks more like a heart look at the heart okay so now that it looks more like a little heart you just slice it and you'll see how all of a sudden you have hearts okay and now we have our heart little at that so cute okay so i'm going to show you how to how to layer it okay so this here i'm actually making it for valentine's day i'm going to have it set up and it's just going to be our little dessert after dinner because of course i'm going to set up a valentine's day dinner it's gonna be nice and romantic and so this is super simple um i'm gonna show you obviously how to do it but you can totally make this for your loved one or even if you're gonna do like valentine's day with yourself or you know girlfriends this is gonna be it's so so cute you're gonna see how it's plated and it just looks like really fancy and it's so easy okay so this is our cake and what i'm gonna do is i'm literally just going to start cutting like little you can totally crumble it but just so that it looks a little more presentable um i'm actually gonna kind of dice it so it's gonna look like me little baby croutons okay okay so if you want to do an individual size you can use little wine glasses but of course i'm making a large portion so i'm going to make it in here okay so now we're just going to scoop it up just like that you're going to fill the bottom next we put our strawberries and you're just going to place them in there wherever they you know they don't have to be it this doesn't have to be like super organized it can be kind of messy because it's still going to look really pretty okay so we put a few of the strawberries on the side just so you can see it once everything gets layered so now we're going to we're going to start piping in the whipped cream and i'm going to show you how i do it it's just super simple because we're going to uh fill it in with our strawberries and cream okay so now we get some of the strawberries and cream and we're going to place that right in the center so that's why you don't have to put the cream in the middle okay now we get some of our homemade strawberry jam and we're just going to drizzle that inside this is a little more tarty so it's going to be like it's just going to add to the flavor because everything's kind of sweet and this is optional you don't have to make your own strawberry jam um but you want to get it on the side so that you can actually see the layer okay because at the end of the day yes it's going to taste delicious no matter what but you still want it to look really pretty so there's our first layer and now we're going to go ahead and get our second layer of cake okay and you can crumble a little bit of it because that way when you bite when you take a bite it's not just like crumbly you're gonna have like little pieces of cake or little hearts okay so you want to make sure that you add a generous amount of cake so that you can actually see the cake in the layers because if not it'll just get lost in the whipped cream okay now we get our strawberries and cream okay so now we're going to finish it off with another layer of cake okay so now to finish this off we're just gonna add a fresh strawberry right on top and i have these cute little designs these little um

recipe video in today's video I'm showing you how to make possibly the easiest keto bread you've ever made and that is keto bread that is made in 90 seconds and I used to call it almost instant keto bread because like in 90 seconds is almost instant compared to 50 minutes in the oven for normal keto bread and it doesn't use any crazy ingredients it's only got really basic ingredients you can use a mug you basically stir it all up in a cup and it's done if you want to do it in the microwave you can I'll tell you about the oven instructions a little bit later on but let's get started with the video [Music] okay so at the end of these recipe videos are like grabbing all of the helpful snippets from the blog posts and putting them into the recipe video as well so that you know you get all the information before you get served because I know people like to jump the gun all right slow down it's 90 seconds this is going to help if you want to make the Kyoto bread dairy-free you can you don't have to use butter you can use coconut oil you can use sesame oil you can use whatever you want olive oil olive oil is actually really delicious because it gives it that you know sort of like flatbread texture or taste and you know that one's a really really great tip the other probably most important question is people say hey I don't have a microwave can I still make this bread yes you can but it will take 20 minutes so what you have to do is pre-heat your oven to 180c or 350f I've found height put it in a oven safe dish so like a ramekin that would definitely help because you know most monks can take a pretty substantial heat but some like crack so making sure that you're putting it in the oven safe dish 20 minutes in the oven and you are done so if you don't have a microwave that's the easiest way to do it but make sure you keep an eye on it because some ovens are hotter than others my oven it usually takes about 20 minutes yours might be 15 so maybe set the timer for 15 and then come back set it for another 5 minutes if it's not completely cooked so again thank you so much for watching this recipe of you if you like more videos like this I am on a mission to make keto easy so if you want to make keto easy to make sure you hit subscribe and I will see you next week", "rZylSfOP7N8": "it was up everybody's you chef Rob bialys they're like a bagel with cheese and toppings amazing one of my favorite foods and we're gonna be making them keto today make sure you subscribe hit the bell icon so you know when I come out with a new video let's do this alright so ketogenic bialys we're using psyllium husk and psyllium husk as the stretchiness that bread has also called like luke glue that holds it all together baking powder and apple cider vinegar it's gonna here a leavening agent but when they combine they fluff it up apple cider vinegar I take it as a shot I'll put hair on your chest but apparently wears out your teeth so don't drink it straight or whatever and then we're also gonna use some egg whites don't throw away the yolks just yet because I like using them as a glaze [Music] okay so you can make these as big or thin as you want I like a little body it's my bialy and I'm gonna make four with this recipe press down the center and that's gonna hold in all of the grease from the cheese and it's gonna keep the topping centered I'm not gonna give you specific times I've got 350 degrees and just go into the starts to get a little bit crisp they'll start to puff up as well so our toppings here there's lots of different ways you can do it you just do like a pizza bag with mozzarella pepperoni my favorite type of bialy is you take a garlic paste use that as your base and then we're gonna put some mozzarella some fresh mozzarella and then some sliced tomatoes really easy if you just put a little bit of sea salt on your garlic keep chopping and the best advice I got from one of my professors once you think you're done chopping your garlic paste you're only halfway through so keep jogging [Music] and now I found these nice little mozzarella pearls at the store if you've got a big sheet mozzarella or just a big ball go ahead slice it up chop it up and do whatever you need to do but these little pearls will work just fine and then some cherry tomatoes if you want go out get a jar of sun-dried tomatoes that would be amazing [Music] just before these get crispy take them out of the oven we're gonna spread our garlic paste in the center and we're gonna give the outside a nice egg wash with the yolks that we saved from our egg whites at the beginning of the recipe [Music] so really just need to do the edges with the egg wash but I'm just going to do all of it because I've got a bunch of yolks so back in the oven 350 degrees and keep them going until they get a nice crisp on the outside the inside should look like bread and as you can see the psyllium husk turns this bread recipe a little bit purple and I don't know why some psyllium husk does it some doesn't either way guys share this recipe with someone you don't love it as always keep Aikido stay healthy peace [Music]", "s7AtJKQxmkA": "after experimenting with locale recipes for years if i still had one guilty pleasure it would be taco bell more specifically the crunchwrap supreme so today we are going to make a crunchwrap supreme that is so close to the original you won't be able to tell the difference besides it's a little bit better i don't really have a problem with the amount of calories in the crunchwrap it's the fact that there's only 16 grams of protein in the whole thing for 530 calories i'm going to show you that you could fit crunchwraps into your diet that tastes legitimately like taco bell even after i've had a couple people try them they've said wow this tastes exactly like taco bell but better so we're not going to waste any more time we're going to get right into it anabolic crunchwrap anabolic sauce god i'm just so excited it's time to eat let's get into it we're going to start out by making the anabolic sauce what sauce is that well cilantro lime sauce and really i got this idea straight from sam the cooking guy shout out to sam the cooking guy it's great to look at other creators and see how they do things and when i was watching his california burrito recipe he showed himself making essentially this sauce but i'm going to just change it up a tad bit to make it a little bit more anabolic and just give it a little different of a taste however the macros are great the calories are low and it's a great sauce to put on if you want to make your standard crunch trap go to a luxury crunchwrap within five minutes and most of the ingredients you have already all this stuff looks like a lot but i guarantee you most of the people that are already watching this have the seasonings and hot sauce and greek yogurt you guys will have most of this stuff you probably will have to pick up two or three things but it is well worth it we're gonna start with our scale with our greek yogurt and we're gonna weigh out a cup which is 224 grams of greek yogurt in his version he used sour cream greek yogurt tastes exactly like sour cream if you ask me and if you ask most people i've made recipes where people have tried it and had no idea that it was greek yogurt and then i'm going to add a little bit of mayo to add some more creaminess to it if this sounds gross at first i kind of understand but once everything's mixed together the cilantro is so strong the garlic that we're about to put in is so strong you're not gonna know the difference that sour cream is in it greek yogurts in it mayonnaise is in it it's just gonna taste incredible you can use garlic powder here but i'm going to use fresh garlic and we're gonna mince it and press it right in here there's nothing like some fresh garlic and that's what i'm gonna use you can use a full teaspoon of garlic powder if you'd like or two fat cloves of garlic you could use your hot sauce of choice i think you use cholula i'm using valentina just a little splash or two some pepper some salt i'm gonna add a fair amount of salt never hurts and we're gonna zest the lime so i don't have like a long zester i'm just gonna use my grater and i'm going to go around the whole lime both the sides and the top now so this is going to stick on the inside you want to get all of it just scrape it down right into the cup some spills on the sides bring it up put it right in there the zest does make a difference so add the zest now we're actually gonna use the juice in the lime here and if you don't have a lime press or whatever this is called you can just squeeze it but since i have a lime press i'm gonna use it so i'm gonna cut this bad boy in half lime press you face it down and all you got to do is push just like the garlic here other heif beautiful we're about there we just have to cut up the cilantro just a little bit now i only want to use about 45 to 50 grams here of cilantro i don't want to have it too overly cilantro i'd rather have a little bit more limey and tangy essentially all you have to do cut it at the stem where the leaves start and i'm just gonna cut it about four times because i'm gonna let the ninja do all the work for me all right so that batch was pretty on point here now you probably should have done it the other way so the wet ingredients are on the bottom when you start mixing but it works either way now you can cut up cilantro you don't have to blend it up you just have to cut the cilantro up real thin since i have it i'm going to use it and it makes it even thinner more saucy i guess i don't know but it is better if you do have it but it tastes great regardless so the great thing about the ninja it comes with these accessories that you can legitimately use this as a mini blender i never use it as a shake or whatever because my protein ice creams are picture sized but it works perfect for making an anabolic sauce okay bye rick definitely use the cilantro and everything on the bottom if you want it to go faster it really only took an extra like 30 seconds but i did have to like push all the wet ingredients down and the reason i'm doing this right now is because i want to be able to put this in the fridge while everything is cooking and it'll thicken up a little bit now when i went to the dollar store they didn't have the clear things they have these at walmart the clear ones but regardless if i blow this in my nose a little bit i'm gonna be able to tell it's goddamn cilantro i'm gonna put this in here with a funnel and so literally all i have to do pour it in here now it is a little thick so it's gonna take a minute for it to drop down but you should have about eight servings in here so you can make eight crunch wraps and each one's about 30 calories 3 grams of protein 3 grams of carbs and i think 2 grams of fat can't beat it though i mean how many even fat free ranch or whatever is 25 calories so this is right on par with it oh and it lasts in the fridge for about up to two weeks i think i would make sure i've only had mine for a week and it's still good but yeah two weeks our sauce is cooling time to make our seasoning for the ground beef as i said we are meal prepping this so we are going to make four servings right out the gate and this is enough to cook a pound of ground beef i don't know the exact grams i will have them by the time that i post this video but i will post all the stuff in the description so you have everything you need to make this we're gonna start with chili powder and then garlic powder and then onion powder and then red pepper flakes which this is also a quarter teaspoon another quarter teaspoon of oregano half a teaspoon of paprika one and a half teaspoons of cumin and just so you know i included the calories for all of this stuff most of it's like a one calorie but i'm just trying to be as transparent as possible and give you guys a complete list of calories if i can now we got one teaspoon of pepper and one teaspoon of kosher salt or sea salt or whatever like thicker salt and you should have most of this stuff at your house if you don't you're probably missing like one thing so i'm just gonna mix it up thoroughly and we're going to start cooking this ground beef here i've cooked this about four times now and i've always been trying to do stuff while the ground beef is cooking and the ground beef is so thin and such little chunks that you don't want to try to do something else because three of the four times i've cooked this i've made the ground beef too dry funny enough the crunch up was still delicious but the meat gets dry really fast because it's so small so i'm gonna get everything else out of the way first and then we're gonna cook our ground beef last we're gonna cut up a tomato your tomato of choice i like roma tomatoes i'm gonna dice these up just as if you were getting them in the crunchwrap you could do this how you want as far as the meal prep goes you can cut a tomato every day so you have fresh tomato or you can cut four days worth of tomato that fourth day is gonna be kind of iffy i'm just gonna cut up a full tomato this is probably about two maybe three crunch wraps worth we're gonna take our head of lettuce and cut up some lettuce as well once again i would not cut up four days worth of lettuce you can it'll work by the fourth day it's gonna be kind of brown and like not loose but like flimsy so i would just cut it day by day you're gonna use two dishes not a big deal and a head of lettuce costs like i don't know a dollar there's no special way here i'm no chef i'm just a guy trying to eat good food so i'm just cutting this up in the random chunks now i'm not gonna do this again because i already have a good amount shredded up but what i just used to zest the lemon i would also cut up the cheese on if i was out of cheese i would rather buy the brick because the stuff they have that's shredded has like this powder and film on it and it's just not the same i'd rather shred a fresh block of cheese this is sharp cheddar reduced fat so it's 90 calories per serving we're only using half an ounce so this will literally make you 16 crunch wraps i would rather use the real thing and use half an ounce then use the fat free and use a full ounce because this has so much more flavor in it now before i even start my flame for the ground beef i'm gonna break this up some people just put it right in i'm not gonna put it right in i used to do it with the spoon all the time and i would much rather just do it myself and go a little piece by piece and wash my hands afterward because that little spoon annoys the living hell out of me because it takes forever to break it up why not just do it like this and then put the flame on and then get going oh and before i do that i'm glad this is sitting right here i'm gonna give literally one two three four so a little bit longer than a second probably 15 calories maybe and spray that down i'm going to do the same thing to the top and once again that's all included in the calories that i'm going to give you at the end of the video now just like remington did i'm using 96 for beef that's the best way to go you can get 99 one turkey but it's too you need to have some fat there's too little fat in it so what i would do typically like i did in my sloppy joe recipe is i mixed a 93 7 and 99.1 turkey if you are dead set on using turkey i think ground beef tastes better but i would go with 96 for fat instead of 99.1 because there's just no flavor like fat gives it flavor that extra three percent makes a big difference that's legitimately four times as much fat now i'm gonna give the top of this same thing one two three four and i'm gonna add my seasoning on the top here so i would much rather go low and slow than try to go too quick and overcook the meat so i'm gonna put on like what would be like a two or three out of ten not like the lowest lowest setting but damn near it and constantly stir because you want all the meat to turn brown at the same time if you have some that are brown and some that are pink then you're gonna overcook the ones that are already brown so just keep an eye on it that's why i said try to get everything prepared and ready now while we're waiting anyway let's go over the tortillas when i was at the store i was stoked to find these flour tortillas wanna know why because on the back here it says one tortilla 190 calories and these ones are humongous like this would cover the whole tostada so i get home and i'm like you know i definitely have to weigh these out just like bread is this supposed to be 71 grams for 190 calories this was 113 grams so is it like actually 300 calories in each tortilla point being always weigh your food because you think you're consuming something even when literally it says one tortilla 190 calories when actually you've got an extra hundred let's mix this up a little bit here moving on to the tortillas that we're gonna use mission car balance i saw some people putting these in the comment section of remington's video too and i was kind of surprised that he didn't use them because i've been using these for years they are great there's literally 110 calories in a full tortilla and we can't cover the whole tostada still but i'll show you what we're gonna do to get over that in a little bit once this ground beef is done in this tortilla there's 110 calories 6 grams of fat 30 carbs with 25 from fiber with 9 grams of protein this is a real anabolic tortilla and then our tostadas we're starting to get there the more pink meat i'm moving towards the middle here because that's where the flame is at and anything that looks almost done i'm moving towards the outside because it's still getting heat it's just not cooking nearly as fast as the stuff in the middle now that the meat is done i'm going to give it a little whirl here get everything nice and wet and then i'm going to put it on this plate here and clean this pan so we can use it for the tortillas all we want to do is get this tortilla warm so it's nice and pliable so i'm going to keep that there for about 20 30 seconds and then i'm gonna flip it now in preparation here i am making a little circle to put in the middle on the back here it's gonna add about i think it was like 20 calories but you're gonna enclose this so the lettuce isn't just gonna fall right out and you're gonna have a full crunchwrap like you would really get from taco bell with this recipe i'm trying to get this literally as close to the real taco bell recipe as possible so this is probably 20 25 calories i already counted it in there and we're gonna use this to close it and then i'm gonna make another one very similar to that so this is nice and pliable what we're gonna do first is put our cheese on here this way we can easily spread the cheese right on the tortilla so we'll zero this out and i'm doing three tablespoons which is about 45 grams here so once this says minus 45 we are good to go now i did this with two tablespoons and it works but the more cheese the better for me i love cheese so i'll spend the extra 20 calories to have more nacho cheese on top this is just regular ass fritos mild cheddar nacho cheese 40 calories for two tablespoons that's really nothing and we're already under 500 calories for this recipe doesn't matter to me i'm gonna spread this around about the same size of the tostada and if you really want to get a good judgment you could legitimately like put it right on top and be like okay yeah i spread it out enough that's pretty much how far you want it as big as the tostada so you can close this properly good we're about there now we're gonna do the same thing with the ground beef we put this on top of here and if you didn't know some of you may some of you might not when you cook four ounces of meat it usually not every single type of meat it usually cooks down to about 84 grams for a four ounce serving raw so i'm gonna get this to say minus 84. that is hot minus 84.1 that's beautiful and we have ground beef taco meat whatever you want to call it in every bite all right this is where i put my shredded cheese on so it's going to melt right on top of the ground beef i zero this out again and i put a half ounce on here now if you want you cannot add that extra tablespoon of nacho cheese and not put this shredded cheese on and you would make up about 60 calories which would almost make it very close to 400 calories overall but once again it's worth it to me i love cheese i want the full flavor i put our tostada on top now the first one i'm going to do is with quote-unquote sour cream so i'm going to get the greek yogurt here and i'm gonna put 42 grams of the greek yogurt on top and what's good about this is just like the tortilla you can spread it right out and we're gonna go until it says minus 42 because that's an ounce and a half minus 41. close enough let's eat now we're gonna spread this around you can do it however you want maybe i'm not even doing it the best way possible get it as evenly as you can my whole thing with taco bell that gets me mad is when they make it and you don't have everything in every bite so that was definitely my goal here shredded cheese ground beef nacho cheese tomatoes everything should be in every single bite my bff doesn't like tomatoes i'm not gonna put tomatoes on just lettuce we're covering about the whole thing and now we put our extra little piece of tortilla on here and we start folding fold fold fold fold and fold and see this is beautiful it's closed we don't have to worry about it we put it down on its head so this side hardens up first and so this goes a little bit faster i'm going to turn up the heat just a little bit but you got to keep your eye on it because i also burnt the tortillas by turning it up and forgetting about it for literally like two minutes now it doesn't have to have too much brownness to it before you flip it but it's nice and crispy and now we want to get the top side crispy and i already got my cilantro sauce out there's gonna be little chunks of cilantro that are a little bit bigger than this little tiny hole for the ketchup it was supposed to be ketchup bottle here so i'm gonna cut off just the tip you'll have a nice even flow it'll come right out and you're gonna feel like you're on the line at taco bell because you could go like spray spray spray long sprays zigzag however you want to do it it's up to you but first i have to heat up that tortilla our first one is done look how beautiful perfectly brown both sides wait for the crunch i'm going to be extra silent you heard it first i present to you a authentic non-authentic mexican taco bell crunchwrap to a tea nacho cheese sour cream cause like i said greek yogurt tastes the exact same no tomato i added a little bit of shredded cheese but a little more cheese never hurt anybody this is beautiful a little squeeze look at that cheese it's ready to just pop right the out let's make my crunchwrap same process this says the heat up a little bit but now that this is hotter this is going to heat up quicker so i'm only going to give it like 15 20 seconds on each side if it starts crisping up when you try to fold it it's not going to fold it's just going to break and i want a nice beautiful crunchwrap for this thumbnail so you know i'm gonna get it right 15 seconds already really nice and pliable i don't even know how much longer this needs this is pretty goddamn hot same thing literally same thing nacho cheese ground beef shredded cheese on top and feel free to play maybe you want more shredded cheese and less nacho cheese feel free to play around with it tostada anabolic cilantro lime sauce what's nice about this is you really don't have to spread it around because this does all the work for you got my little zigzag ooh let's zigzag back and forth this way yeah kill them all right that's good so i'm gonna have my tomatoes down so they stick nice and good so we got tomatoes in every bite let's get our lettuce on here now we're gonna put our extra piece on and we're gonna fold fold keep on folding don't stop oh this might barely make it this one's gonna be a little bit open but at least i made my best friends perfectly lay this right on top that's it we're gonna wait we'll be back for the closing remarks and the macros first rule of thumb you have to add some sort of taco bell sauce my preferred is fire i also have diablo but you must put something if you don't have any extra package at the house like my crazy ass does you could also buy the fire sauce at the store i think it's like 250 or three bucks and you got a whole bottle well worth it but you gotta add the fire sauce is this hands and what hands and knees hands and i don't even know the saying head and shoulders above is this hands knees and shoulders above a taco bell crunchwrap no i'm not gonna sit here and lie to you is it better yes is it like oh my god it's so much better i wouldn't say yes unless you really like the cilantro lime sauce because that is a game changer but my best friend doesn't like the cilantro lime sauce so it's more like sour cream that we just put on hers and it tastes so similar to a taco bell crunchwrap just a little bit better the macros on the cilantro lime crunch wrap goes as follows 480 calories 24 fat 49 carb 46 protein or for the regular contract you're saving about nine calories 471 calories 23 fat 49 carbs 46 protein so you're getting about 30 grams more protein in each one you can choose to have a regular crunch wrap or you can upgrade and get the cilantro lime if you do like that type of sauce and it is so fresh tasting and so good that you will absolutely love it i guarantee if you like crunch wraps you will love these you will have now in about it took me about 45 minutes with recording and everything which would normally take me about half an hour to meal prep four meals if you have a pan ready all you gotta do is throw the tortilla on get your ingredients cut up and while the ground beef is reheating cut your vegetables up get that tortilla warm put your nacho cheese on and get everything on and you're ready to go huge shout out to sam the cooking guy for helping me and making this sauce and helping me think of making this sauce i hope you guys are eating well we are four or five recipes in at this point and i have had nothing but good feedback get a crunchwrap get a protein ice cream i don't care if it's your mint oreo i don't care if it's your cinnamon toast crunch but go and eat something good i guarantee you will like these ice creams and until next time i will see you in that next one you", "RYPLCNWD80E": "Welcome to Whole Cake Island, This week we prepared a new Food Wars recipe!

In a bowl, pour 1 tsp of grated ginger, 1 tsp of grated garlic, 1 tbsp of grated onion, 3 tbsp of orange juice, 3 tbsp of soy sauce. If you want the marinade to be a little less salty, you can decrease the amount of soy sauce and increase the amount of orange juice. and 1 tbsp of honey. Mix well. To roll up the p\u00e2t\u00e9, use very thin slices of beef jerky. Put them on a plate. And pour the marinade over it. Spread the sauce all over the place. Leave to marinate for a minimum of 1 hour or overnight in the fridge. For the liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, start by cutting a carrot into small cubes. Do the same with 60g of shimeji mushrooms. You can also use other mushrooms if you can't find shimeji mushrooms. In a pan over low to medium heat, pour 3 to 4 tbsp of oil. And brown 2 chopped onions. Add salt. When the onions have browned, add the carrots. Then the mushrooms. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. In the meantime, cut 6 green beans into small pieces. You can put more if you want. And add them to the pan. Add salt and mix. Then add 30g of butter, 1 bay leaf, and 150g of deveined chicken liver. If you don't like poultry liver, you can reduce the quantity or replace it with minced meat, for example. Let the liver cook over low heat and remove it when it is almost cooked. Then remove the vegetables from the heat. We will now mix the liver until we obtain a paste. And we do the same with the chicken breast. In a salad bowl, pour 50ml of heavy cream. And crumble 3 slices of sandwich bread. Mix and smash down until you get a paste. Add the liver and chicken. And season with 6g of salt, \u00bd tsp of thyme, \u00bd tsp of garlic and 1g of pepper. Do not forget the 2 tbsp of mayonnaise. And finally, remove the bay leaf before adding the vegetables. Mix the preparation. We didn't have gloves so we used a freezer bag to mix everything. Overlapping slices of turkey bacon are placed on a tray covered with cling film . Put half of the p\u00e2t\u00e9 on the end. Then push in 2 chicken bones. And cover with the remaining p\u00e2t\u00e9. Form a cylinder and roll up the p\u00e2t\u00e9. And finally, lay the marinated slices of beef, overlapping them. And roll the p\u00e2t\u00e9 in it. Place the p\u00e2t\u00e9 in a dish covered with baking paper to prevent the meat from sticking to it if the honey in the marinade caramelizes. And bake for about 40 minutes in an oven preheated at 180 \u00b0 C. While the meat is cooking, fry potato wedges. Carrot is cut into thin slices. And cook in butter over low heat. Lightly season with salt. They are ready when they are easily cut. They were perfect as an accompaniment to the p\u00e2t\u00e9. Remove them and in the same pan, pour 150ml of water. Add 2 tsp of powdered veal stock. Mix and let the sauce reduce. Pour the sauce into a syringe for the dressing. When the p\u00e2t\u00e9 is ready, remove it from the oven. And baste it with the melted butter in the bottom of the dish. There you go, the liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 is ready to be served! Take it off and serve it on a plate. Serve it with salad, carrots, potatoes and asparagus. Coat the p\u00e2t\u00e9 with the remaining marinade. And inject the meat with veal stock. And There you go ! We remade Soma's caveman meat from Food Wars! We're super happy with the result and it's our first real anime meat with bones on the side. And frankly it was super good. The only problem is that the marinade was really salty. So we recommend using soy sauce reduced in salt or increasing the quantity of orange juice and reducing the soy sauce. In any case we found it really necessary, it added a spicy, sweet and salty side to the p\u00e2t\u00e9 which counterbalances the overpowering taste of poultry liver. If you really can't stand the chicken liver, you can replace it with another meat. There you go, we hope you enjoyed the video.

I love garlic too, and I've always said that it's a deal breaker for picking a husband in life because I eat so much garlic, it comes out of my pores, and I basically smell like a salami. So, fresh garlic, you want it to be super firm, no dimpling whatsoever, and when I bring it home, I crack it, the whole bulb upside down, boom, knock it upside down, root end up, (clicks) crush, and then I bounce it with a knife to take of its little jacket, okay? Once you get the garlic peeled, you can pop it in the fridge, 20 or 30 cloves at a time ready to use. Now, when you can't get good garlic or when you just run out of it, that's when we go to granulated garlic or garlic slices that you can grind or crush and that's fine. Garlic salt I don't buy normally and I don't use. I mean, I would if I have to, but I like to be the boss of my salt and the boss of my garlic. So I try and keep them (clicks) separate worlds.

They're basically a lot of alcohol, and then they put flavorings in there. Lot of bark and spices and herbs and really intense flavorings. One of the original bitters is called Angostura. Angostura. You can get that, like, in any supermarket. They all come with dasher tops, which are these tops that, you know, only a little bit'll come out when you do that.

Today, I'm featuring my adapted keto black forest cheesecake. This is in celebration, and as a very special thank you to all of my 40,000 subscribers. I can't believe that we've reached this milestone. To each and everyone who has taken time to subscribe, thank you. I'm very grateful to all of you for subscribing. First of all, I want to explain what inspired me to make this Black Forest cheesecake. And, it started with \"It's cherry season and I absolutely love cherries.\" But, because cherries are very high in fructose, and very sweet, unfortunately, they're far too sweet for me to eat. Even just three cherries greatly increases my blood sugar. And, the other reason I wanted to make this cake, as a special thank you, is because one of my favorite cakes has always been the German classic Black Forest cake. And, I wanted to share this recipe, on this momentous occasion, with all of you. As I said, I know that cherries are very high in fructose. But, keep listening, because I will discuss this point in the video and also provide for you a tasty, much lower-carb option, as well as give you the macro breakdown, if you do choose to use cherries because you're not that sensitive to fructose. So, in other words, two ways of making this cake. You may notice that a very important thing about this video is that I have simplified this recipe, and detailed each step. So, even if you're a brand new baker or new to cooking, you'll be able to follow along and make this amazing recipe. So, let's get started and follow along with the step-by-step instructions to make this keto cheesecake adaptation. Now, the macronutrient ratio for the black forest cheesecake, version 1, is 5 to 1, with 6.6 grams of total carbs, 1.1 gram of dietary fiber, resulting in 5.5 grams of net carbs per slice of cake. Now, let's get started. And, please follow along as I describe each step to ensure that you are successful when making this amazing treat. The first step is to make this really rich, flourless chocolate cake. For this cake, you will also need to make a batch of my chocolate truffles. I have demonstrated and explained how to make these truffles many times. So I'll just provide the link in the description below, for you to check out the video and the recipe so that you can make it. It's very quick and easy. And, if you're not familiar with how I do things, I want you to know that all videos and written recipe links that I mention, as well as the link for this particular written recipe for the Black Forest cheesecake, are all provided below the YouTube thumbnail and description, so check them out there, please. Now, to keep going with the recipe. After you make the chocolate truffles, you'll realize you do not need the entire amount of the chocolate truffle liquid. You will only need about 200 grams. So, set that quantity aside to cool to room temperature. And then, use the rest to make your favorite shaped chocolate truffles. Next, preheat your oven to 150 degrees celsius or 300 degrees fahrenheit. And also, place parchment paper on a 17 centimeter by 42 centimeter or 11 inch by 17 inch baking sheet. At this point, I also bloom the gelatin, by sprinkling the powdered gelatin into my glass of cold water, stirring well until the gelatin is completely dissolved, and then just setting it aside for about 10 minutes, in order to allow the gelatin to bloom. For the next step, you're going to need two separate bowls in order to separate the eggs. Place the yolks into one mixing bowl and the whites into another mixing bowl. I'm going to put them directly into my stand mixer bowl. Now, get the bowl with the chocolate truffle liquid. Pour the room temperature chocolate truffle liquid into the egg yolks. Whisk everything together to combine well and set this aside. Next, whip the egg whites until all the albumen has been whipped and is frothy. At this point, add the lemon juice. Or, if you prefer, white vinegar. And, continue whipping until the egg whites have formed a stiff peak stage. Scoop out about 1/3 of the egg whites and transfer to the bowl with the chocolate egg mixture and whip vigorously together. This will aerate and lighten the egg yolks and make it much easier to blend with the rest of the egg whites. Then, transfer a second third of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate yolk bowl and gently fold to combine. While you're folding, be very careful not to deflate the whipped egg whites. And then, just repeat with the last third of the egg. whites Try to get most of the whites integrated into the chocolate, but don't worry if you don't get all of it. Pour the cake batter into the prepared, parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the batter out to form a rectangle that is about three quarter inch or two centimeters thick. Just use a spatula to level things out so that it's the same thickness all the way through. For layered cakes, I like using the flat cookie sheet method. I like this method because I get a very even and thin layer of cake. And, it bakes very quickly and evenly. However, if you don't like doing the cookie sheet method, an alternative is you can prepare the same cake by using a nine inch springform pan and just make a regular cake. And then, once the cake is cooled, divide it into two layers. Both methods work. I just find that I get a much nicer, thinner result by using my sheet pan method, which is more in keeping of what I want for this cake. Next, put your baking sheet into the middle position of your oven and set your timer for 20 minutes. Depending how evenly your oven heats, you may want to rotate the entire pan after the first 10 minutes to ensure even baking. Test your cake for doneness by touching the center and see if it springs back properly. Or, insert a toothpick and make sure that it comes out dry. If, for whatever reason, the cake is not done, put it back in the oven and bake for two to five minutes. No longer. You will find that the cake will dry out and will not be soft and moist. So, having taken this out of the oven, let your sheet of cake cool in the pan and then, 10 to 15 minutes later, place a sheet of parchment on top of the cake and use some sort of wire rack or your cooling rack to flip it over. Then, peel off the parchment that was under the cake and let the cake rest upside down while you make the no-bake cheesecake. To make things easier, first, remelt the gelatin and let the gelatin get to room temperature. As you can see on this table, I've assembled all the ingredients that you'll need for the no-bake cheesecake. I'd like to remind you that the cream cheese and ricotta cheese should be at room temperature. This will help create a much creamier and even textured cheesecake. So, place the cream cheese and ricotta into a mixing bowl. And, whip at high speed continuously, both to soften, and to remove any lumpy cheese bits. Add your sweetener that you ground to a confectionery powder, and also add the lemon juice. Don't forget to scrape the bowl once in a while to ensure that all of the cream cheese that may be stuck to the side or bottom is also incorporated into this mixture. Now, add your vanilla and continue whipping to combine. While you continue whipping, slowly pour the melted gelatin into the center part of the cheesecake mixture. And, continue whipping until everything is well combined and all the ingredients are nice and creamy and smooth, and everything is lump free, and the texture looks very velvety. And, move this bowl aside for a moment, while you whip up the heavy whipping cream to a medium stiffness stage, at which point you simply just pour in the whipped cream into the bowl with the cream cheese mixture. And, fold thoroughly until everything is well combined. And, you guessed it, set aside on your counter so you can get everything together in order that you can assemble the Black Forest cheesecake. Now to assemble the black forest cheesecake. Choose either a square or round springform pan. It really doesn't matter which. But, do fit a parchment sheet on the bottom of the springform pan. And, in order to make it easier to remove the cake from the pan, line the sides of the pan with parchment. So, after deciding if you're going to make it a circle or a rectangle, You'll need to cut out two shapes from your flat sheet of cake. As you can see, oops, I sort of didn't have enough room, but that's okay. Lay the less nice piece of cake, if this is your situation like mine, on the bottom of the lined spring form pan. As you do this, you may be wondering what do I do with the rest of the scraps of cake? Oh, I have a good suggestion for you here. May I suggest that you use these pieces of cake, cut up into cubes, as a replacement for my keto oreo cookies, and use these pieces to make my Easy Tiramisu Parfait. I'll provide the link for this in the description below, as well. Okay, back to business. Pour half of your no-bake cheesecake mixture on top of the chocolate cake layer. And, smooth it out with your spatula. For my purposes, and to keep the carbs as low as possible, I'm going to use strawberries. However, this is the point where you can substitute an equal amount of fresh, cut up cherry pieces, if you're not affected by the fructose, and you can tolerate a few extra carbs. As I said, I'm using strawberry pieces for this version. Gently place, do not press, the strawberry pieces on top of this cheesecake layer. And, while you're doing this, arrange some of the strawberry pieces so that you can see them from the outside, and you'll have kind of a ribbon of red in the center of your cake. It's not necessary to do this. I just think it looks really nice. And, I do this with either strawberries or the cherry version. Having distributed all of my strawberries on top, I'm going to pour the rest of the cheesecake on top of the strawberries. And, this time, carefully smooth the surface. In order for the cheesecake to set, I highly recommend you cover the cake with cling wrap and refrigerate overnight. I think it's important to leave it overnight because of the very thick layer of cheesecake, and because you have it in a springform pan. As a result of this, it will set a little bit more slowly. It's now the next morning, and I'm going to finish and garnish this cake. First, place the second piece of the chocolate cake, which you cut out the other day, on top of the cheesecake. By the way, you don't have to refrigerate the chocolate cake overnight. It'll be fine. Just cover it with some cling wrap, so that it doesn't completely dry out. As you're laying the cake, this time put the smoother side up. Before I forget, I want to mention that I will be using a little bit more whipped cream. And, put this whipped cream into a piping bag, in which i've already put a decorative tip. Before proceeding, gently and carefully loosen the springform pan and remove the cake from the springform pan. Here's a little tip I've discovered I'd like to share with you. In order to help the chocolate shavings stick to the cake, and not just fall off each time you cut a slice, spread a thin layer of your whipped cream on top of the chocolate cake. Do so all the way to the edges of the cake. Then, sprinkle the roughly chopped or, if you prefer, grated shavings over the surface. Stop at about one-half inch or two centimeters from the edge of the cake. And, lastly, take your piping bag with the whipped cream qnd squeeze out a decorative perimeter of your choice. Because this cake is already fancy enough, I thought that just simple continuous swirl was a really nice way to go. When you make this cake, please do take a photo and tag me on instagram. I'd love to see how you've decorated it. And also, let me know what your friends and family thought of this cake. I think this looks really nice. So that this cake is much easier for you to cut, and to allow the soft whipped cream to set, I would strongly recommend that you put it into the fridge for about 30 to 60 minutes before you cut and serve. As I said at the beginning, I am absolutely flabbergasted that so many of you have complimented me and subscribed. Thank you again to each and every person who has subscribed, all 40 000 of you! And, I look forward to our next milestone, 50 000. So, do share this link with people that you know that may also like the channel and/or the recipes. Now, for the alternative. Here's the macronutrient chart for the low carb Black Forest cake with black cherries. As I've already explained, as a diabetic, I find that very small quantities of cherries, due to their high fructose, affect me negatively and raise my blood sugar, so I can't make this version. But, if you want a more authentic black forest cheesecake, all you have to do is follow the same steps up to the point where you're using strawberries. At this point, you simply replace the strawberry pieces with pitted and quartered fresh cherries. If you're super motivated and want a more classic version, however, an alternative to using just fresh cherries, you may instead want to make the cherry syrup. It's the same recipe as the one that I used to make my blueberry syrup. The difference in the instructions, though, would be not to puree the cherries after you've cooked them. You want the cherries to remain chunky. And, after making the syrup, it's really important that you let the whole thing cool to room temperature. Once your cherry syrup is completely cool, just pour it on top of the first layer of cheesecake, as we did with the strawberries. And, the rest of the instructions are the same. If you are making the cherry version, you may want to use a few of the whole cherries, as garnish, on top of the cake. Whichever way you choose to make it, with strawberries, fresh cherries, or the cherry syrup. I hope that you will agree that this is a delicious black forest cheesecake. But, because this cake is so good, you may be tempted, but I'd like to caution you: Remember portion control. Thank you so much for watching this 40 000 subscriber special cake video.

Cheers!", "aGzTZlSzito": "hey guys my name is Sylar and better known as the demon stealer and I run headbangers kitchen I'm super excited about doing my first collaboration video with Matt and mega from keto connects this is going to be awesome so I'd like to challenge you guys to make something from my recipes pick whichever one you like and make it on keto connect hey guys hi got something special today yeah you don't usually see us together in cooking recipe reduce but yet we are making a keto chocolate cake from headbangers kitchen HBK you know what else HP K stands for what the Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels headbangers kitchen is a lot fuller names oh yeah headbangers kitchen so you guys probably know him will link his channel below one thing I want to compliment him on the lighting in his kitchen is just crazy good and it compared to this ya know a column in our kitchen um but yeah he has a lot of great recipes a lot of Indian recipes so we're probably going to end up trying a lot more other than this but we've never made a chocolate cake before or a real cake I feel like and this is flourless so it's great for people with allergies and stuff yeah everyone's always asking can you sell it to coconut flour for almond flour there's no flour in them no substitutions we are going to make it and try it and show you what's up also I'm going to link his original recipe below we are modifying it a pretty decent amount because we're using different ingredients and we're dumb Americans that don't know how to use the metric system so we had to convert all that yeah and we're doing a half recipe half recipe doing it in a thin baking sheet so we think the cook time is going to be a lot different and we're also going to throw a little twist into it too and we will also link that below you'll be able to see exactly what we do step-by-step okay how do we start so we first melt the chocolate and the butter together that's always a great step right melt chocolate also we're going to do no music this video we're just going to cook a lot of people suggested it so yeah looking at a try no ultimate will come in handy when we're on the Rachael Ray Show we must initial table Emma's and this the butter barn okay right sure anyone tried this recipe before it's one of the most popular recipes on his channel yeah and and he's making one of our recipes so watch that video we'll probably linked up below yeah and also something I didn't know about him I always thought he was in America but he's actually in India I could kind of tell just from the background I lived in India for year guys and I'm India Sam - no it doesn't learn how to cook any recipes while she was there though I was studying I was prioritizing my school throws then I wonder if he has any plans on coming to America or if is he's liking it there in India yeah oh we also have a to camera setup going right now which I'll try editing together you guys can probably tell we're gonna melt the chocolate and the butter together in bursts of like 30 seconds you don't want to like overdo it you can also do a double broiler than most people do but we don't do it and that's what style headbangers kitchen style he does in his video he's a double boiler it takes long though yeah I know there are a lot more another thing is we're using 100% baker's chocolate he uses 85% so ours is going to be not as sweet we might change this ratio a little more but we're adding a little bit of extra cream to account for that this melted quickly so we did like what like a spoke total of 60 seconds it was 45 with just the chocolate and then 30 with the butter and chocolate oh yeah perfect now what what's next then we add the cream or it embedded um so that is 5 tablespoons of heavy cream the recipe calls for a quarter cup we're adding a little extra because of the higher the bitterness of the chocolate he is this truly is we are going to use a wrist result which is about 80% as we Trudy I believe oh I wouldn't want to eat that because if you want to come on [Music] [Applause] isn't cooking fun guys sure okay and then want to incorporate the eggs one at a time so you can mix while I add or vice versa oh you know very good at math anything okay add one right now yeah yeah just to like fully incorporate break the stuff at the broken yeah okay so now he's beautiful different guy well we'll see how it turns out but I think we actually need to mix it more we need to emulsify it okay so yeah I don't know if we just bad on the stop but now we want to spray this is a little Oh what's up we need to whip the egg white and then you fold the egg whites in a bowl like more a fluff I don't know that and the goal is to get stiff peaks and you can tell you can tell they're stiff if the peak just say it's there it doesn't like drop you can tell the peaks are stiff if the peaks are stiff exactly it already looks like the fast submarine isn't it yeah we're not pulling this up super we're not multiplying get well guys aho really knows what's up pour that in here let's just go with the batches two batches okay yeah no okay all scooped up yeah fold it in you don't want to like be aggressive with it literally what he does in this video you also don't want to just keep it at the top I mean it can't it has to be delicious regardless right yeah of course it's actually helping a multi-value with the big white yeah this is helping a lot so we messed up I'd say a little bit on the emulsion step didn't quite get it to emulsify but it's looking good now you want to go with the rest okay while Matt's saying that I'm going to spray our pan with some coconut oil you get ours at Trader Joe's you ever really found it elsewhere there's going to be good I love trying other people's recipes we don't do it very much yeah we should do it more I really like to try his I just thought he had a tikka masala chicken tikka masala recipe which is just like every white person's favorite Indian dish basically I think I'm allowed to say that am i yeah but it is so funny what people are always say like tikka masala it's like no one has that except white people they're like oh my favorite the chicken masala I'm like short Africa result yeah but people always like even like my friend yesterday you both were just saying tikka masala okay yeah that means like spice yeah it's like a spice yeah spices like spices okay here we go let's enter that yeah this looks great it's almost like a mousse and it could also be just very wrong I don't get it I don't think this is wrong cuz we're baking it yeah you'll be surprised the things you can just throw in the oven and they turn end up turning out well here's one more definitely more liquid was it yeah I like porn right no what do you think that could be about margin aspect do you think I think it might be the Baker is chocolate too oh maybe that's stroke but yeah this looks good looks like it'll turn out favorite this might be in the realm of brownie almost - it's going in guys we'll be back in 20 to 30 minutes we're doing a shredded coconut whipped topping yeah and so instead of just normal whipped creams we are adding we're doing four parts heavy whipping cream to one part cream cheese this is a trick we use a lot it makes the whipped cream just like more dense and kinky at a key and good good-o like I would make more now we are adding the cream cheese good now we are going to add a couple tablespoons shredded coconut let's do two tablespoons is that a good consistency yeah the nice cream cheese topping all right oh it's a good consistency this is what I like as opposed to just the airy whipped cream media then use vanilla I think but no one does so much good good I didn't even know how important it was until I started baking so much vanilla is the salt of desert yeah it really isn't my god said that I was like that is brilliant but it's probably like known that is that's the case GameChanger hmm oh my god man vanilla guys twenty and four minutes it's looking good it smells really chocolate in it looks like a big browning cake we are going to cut us each a piece top it with our top oh it feels nice and moist what would you guys call it the other thing boy oh yeah I just heard that comment this morning I could say it a lot in that video though in the meal prep video where we said vo crops 37 times in the person what is so funny Let Me Entertain You we're going to cut us up a slice and enjoy it on the tape on the ground and he'll play-by-play on the taste yeah we want a really deep dive on the taste get that all right yo hey we got each a slice here this is we're doing ten slices for the whole thing so we didn't calculate the nutrition yet no we'll have that like link below yeah and we got our nice coconut topping - this cake just based on cutting it is so incredibly moist like as you cut it little liquid like comes to the surface the fat maybe that's because we didn't all disciple we like it like it's also just a lot of fat in here yeah no flour to absorb it which is great yeah so we'll try it on its own first yeah and then we'll add its Jen this is my kind dessert is great super decadent dark chocolate so but not you is not too dark not bitter it's pretty dark but we also use darker chocolate than him but I like it dark no I know that's nothing even though we did 100% cacao it still turned out really good one thing to be cautious of when you use the super dark chocolate like we did in the baking is when it hardens it kind of just like hard is almost back into a chocolate bar which is good with a crystal unlike not that much but this will be good once it cools off you'll probably want to microwave it I'm thinking yeah but it's like a brownie almost yeah yeah this is really good I want to calculate the nutrition to see the car because it's super low carb it is no flowers or anything you undo the topic yeah we're on the edge Jim Cooper that's right this is going to be perfect with the topping you have you guys haven't checked out headbangers kitchen I feel like a lot of the people that want to our channel also already know about him kind of yeah but definitely check him out for dude and he says he's just a really cool guy yeah super down-to-earth like he seems like a genuine honest guy I'm his wife the thing I love about a YouTube channel is when you watch the video and you just feel good after watching it which you always get from him and you can get a good vibe of a person just from watching their videos yeah you're gonna he's gonna do some pink salt too right oh yeah well I want to try with just this first just with the cream on top but it's light even with the cream change I'm topping yeah it cuts through the dark chocolate a little bit tricky look at it could be yeah you could use even a little more and I always like putting some salt on my dessert as you guys don't do it or you think it's kind of weird try it really maybe just do a little crack it brings out the flavors a lot oh man this is amazing I could just eat the whole pie don't do a little crack a little crack of salt I can't Audrey there yeah Microsoft she's been talking about trying to make a we make coconut flour brownie it's like two weeks ago for a recipe and she's been talking about the member sent by day tomorrow yeah I look fantasize about stuff like

"OtESNaxK8-A": "hi guys welcome welcome back to my channel it's Natasha aka walnuts diva Chronicles keto and I'm back with another recipe one that's highly requested by you guys I'll share the ingredients and the recipe for all the items in the dish in the description box below it would have gotten a little bit lengthy because it's essentially three recipes I whipped up an easy and delicious face with the crab meat and the shrimp and use it within both the chopper and to make the crab cakes my shrimp are frozen so I did have to throw them out but if you get them wrong fresh you can of course skip this long step I ended up adding 3 ounces of white shrimp with the tail removed to the bowl to thaw I'll go ahead and drain my shrimp wants thought and do the same thing to my crabmeat once I take that out the can because there is considerable amount of moisture and water in there you just want to drain that out we want our patties to be relatively dry and then go ahead and drizzle the seafood with a little bit of buttery coconut oil just to help with the marination process I think went ahead and started seasoning the seafood a little bit of Redmond sea salt some black pepper some onion powder some Mexican oregano but of course you know we got a stir it all together and I keep combining it I kept adding things as I went I had smoked paprika a bunch of things but you'll see I'll keep combining it to make sure it's all equally seasoned I then let the seafood mixture marinate for 45 minutes I chopped up an assortment of bell peppers and my food processor that I plan to add to the chapel's and also into the crab and shrimp cakes want to go ahead and add the crab and shrimp seafood mixture into the food processor and give that a little pulse just to make it chunky I don't want the bits too big but I don't want to have it like a puree either and then go ahead and saute about a tablespoon of white onion in some Kerrygold butter I'm gonna go ahead and make the base then I'm going to add to the chocolate I want to saute that shrimp and crab and onion and pepper and everything fried toss it into the batter and make the [Music] [Music] feel free to add a little bit of garlic powder onion powder or other seasonings at this stage later in the flavor at every chance you get add the seafood mixture to the pan with the onions and peppers sauteing and carry gold butter and then I went ahead and stir-fried like all that together mix it together and added another doll above carry gold mix it together again and let all those flavors come together honestly you guys can stop right here and have a delicious meal I had to hold myself back from eating this after I just taste tested it to see if the flavors were all right they were all right all right there was almost no seafood in the chapel okay now on to the choppa I softened 1 ounce of cream cheese in the microwave let that cool for a bit and then I'm gonna add 1 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese a sprinkling of garlic probably about quarter teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon some onion powder nutritional yeast [Music] I then add a teaspoon of the white onions as well as the mixed bell peppers to the mix for the chapel's and get that all combined I added about an eighth of a cup of shredded Parmesan cheese that's probably about a tablespoon and a half or so [Music] I then add the sauteed seafood mix to the egg batter for the chapel's by the way I split the seafood make sure about 40 60 leaving the majority for the seafood cakes and less for the chops I'm definitely gonna lay some mozzarella cheese down on the griddle to get Chava started but I also add about a quarter cup to the batter [Music] I then added in a half of a tablespoon of almond flour to the mix just to give it a little bit more sturdiness and integrity I don't quite trust it with only cheese and eggs but that's just me I chopped up about two tablespoons of whole umi-friend cheese in the food processor I love this cheese it adds that nice extra saltiness to the chavo I want to test and compare when I get my - waffle maker in a couple of days and see if the brownness is the same with this will let me cheese in that unit whether it's this unit that's browning it fast or if it's I don't know we'll see it really does come out nicely though because those crunchy pieces are really delicious and then the pieces that are less done it's a nice complement really I'm just curious to see the difference I'll go back in after a couple minutes of cooking the chocolate layer in some more seafood make sure some who love me cheese some mozzarella cheese close it back down and let it cook for a few more I think I got a little carried away here with the portions because the house smells so good at this point just fill in the waffle trays about 3/4 of the way to make sure it doesn't overflow like it did for me here now it's time to up up a basic dry dredge that will act as the coating of the seafood cakes this will help to make the outer crust even lighter and more delicious and crunchy some shredded Parmesan cheese a little nutritional yeast some garlic powder onion powder [Music] a sprinkling of oregano [Music] I'm gonna go ahead and add some peanuts to the mix that you are so delicious buttery and salty they have Himalayan sea salt and coconut oil on them and they're actually sprouted nuts so they're super nutritious I was running out of pork rinds what I added what I had lots of them make sure to to add to the texture and crunch I then minced the dry dredge for the outer coating of the cakes in the food processor [Music] so at 1/4 cup of egg whites tunze seafood make sure to help hold the cakes together add about a tablespoon and a half of the dry dredge to the shrimp and crab make sure it'll help with the binding I added about a teaspoon of coconut flour to the crab and shrimp mixture for the cakes because I want it to absorb some of the excess moisture that's in there I then set up my little dredging station I have one part that's just purely coconut flour with a little salt I'll have egg whites in the middle for the wash and then I'll have the dry dredge that we just made and put together so I go ahead and eyeball it and work to get equal parts and divide up the seafood mixture so I'll have even size patties and roll them out then they all get a dip in the dredging station first coconut flour then egg white wash then dry dredge for the coating I like to use a good cast iron Dutch pan for frying because the heat is more even and I get it to about 340 degrees I didn't use it the mama I used my grandmother's flipped test and it came out perfectly the oil was right where I needed it to be to get it crisp crunchy outside with a tender inside repeat the breading and frying process until all your shrimp and crab cakes are done I cooked the cakes for about 30 seconds on each side I could see when the edges of the cake start to get a little bit golden brown that's when I flipped them then fry on the other side for about another 30 seconds and remove with a slotted spoon now on to making the decadent hollandaise sauce it's so easy to make you'll want to make it every week so that you can have it for a weekend's weekdays to put on eggs crab cakes or everything like it's delicious I'm gonna start the hollandaise sauce by separating the yolks of two eggs from the whites and setting them aside in a medium bowl I definitely go out of my way to use pasture-raised and organic eggs and recipes like this where there's not a cooking process to the eggs they're not even tempered so you really do want to get the best quality eggs you can get your hands off whisk the eggs for a few minutes until they get lighter yellow in color and they start to thicken a bit and get a little bit frothy I then melted 1 stick or 1/2 a cup of Vital farms butter and set that aside pour out and set aside 1 teaspoon of lemon juice start slowly adding in the melted butter into the egg mix while whisking keep whisking continuously this part is important just go one teaspoon at a time keep whisking in just be patient once you start to see it emulsify a bit like this you can then start alternating putting in butter and lemon juice butter and lemon juice until you're done with both [Music] [Music] at this stage you can add a little sea salt to the hollandaise sauce I then continue to incorporate the melted butter and lemon juice into the egg mix all while whisking you'll definitely run out of lemon juice before you run out of butter so once you do run out of the lemon juice just continue to slowly add in that melted butter until everything is done and the entire mix is emulsified and you've got a beautiful hollandaise sauce then for the final part of this dish I'm gonna go ahead and poach an egg filled a small pan with water about 3/4 of the way full another thing I do to help the egg form a little pod almost like a cocoon around the yolk is just to give the water a little bit of a swirl to create almost like a vortex plus you'll also want to add some white vinegar to the simmering water before you submerge your egg for poaching this will be another level of insurance to make sure the egg holds together and creates like a little pod and a little cocoon just for your poached egg once cooked to about a soft poach I will remove the poached egg from the heated water and from the fire so they'll stop cooking now we're ready to build our dish I'll go ahead and grab one of those tasty shrimp and crab chapels and set it down then I taught the chopper with a crispy yet tender delicious crab and shrimp cake next I taught my crab cake with a gently poached egg I then take this already scrumptious dish to the next level by drowning it in hollandaise sauce lastly for flavor in a little garnish I add a bit of fresh chopped chives atop the entire dish feel free to enjoy the chapel the shrimp and crab cake or the poached egg by themselves or together and hollandaise sauce is waited for so many different recipes I hope you get a lot of value out of this video here and that you make and enjoy this delicious recipe

"five bucks for hummus really after watching this video i hope you realize that making hummus at home is really worth it making hummus at home is really cheap and cost-effective and it tastes super delicious it's way better than the store-bought one i highly encourage you to try it yourself on top of that if you got all the ingredients it should take you no more than 15 to 20 minutes to make fresh hummus right at home to make hummus you need tahini sauce which could be homemade or store bought chickpeas which you could also buy at store in a can or you can make fresh by boiling it at home also you would need some garlic lemon juice olive oil and some water and also some cumin full recipe in both metric and imperial units is listed in the description below start this recipe i'm going to start by pouring in the tahini sauce you can easily make this at home or you could buy it from the store either way you want to make sure that it's pretty smooth in texture if you want me to show how to make tahini sauce let me know in the comments below and i'll post that recipe next you want to go ahead and blitz the tahini sauce blitz it for about a good minute or two or until the texture becomes quite smooth kinda like mine doing this step will make our hummus a lot creamier and smoother in texture next you want to start gradually adding in your olive oil for this recipe i'm using about two tablespoons of olive oil in total next you're going to add about 1 4 teaspoon of cumin you can tweak this recipe according to your taste also i added about one clove of garlic go ahead and mix that in and then add in the rest of your olive oil and then continue to blitz it for another minute at this point your tahini sauce should be nice and creamy next you want to go ahead and add in your chickpeas into your food processor and then go ahead and blitz that all together since i don't have a big food processor i'm doing it in stages but if you have a big food processor just put it all in once also if you start seeing some lumps forming in just take a spatula and mix your chickpea mixture to make the hummus rich and creamy we're going to continually add some water the water is what allows it to become creamy after a while while checking i saw that my hummus was getting there it wasn't quite creamy like i wanted so i kept adding more water and kept blitzing it to reach a nice creamy consistency it should take you on a good processor five to six minutes for seasoning the hummus i added about half a teaspoon of salt and mix that in properly and before blitzing the hummus again i added a splash of water and to add some tanginess i added some lemon juice it was about a half medium sized squeezed lemon finally i blissed it for another minute or two and then added some more water to get that final creamy texture again blitz it one more time and that was pretty much it for getting a nice rich creamy consistency for a hummus decorating the hummus was quite easy that's why i had my wife do it i'm just kidding she's more creative that's why i told her to decorate it because i suck at that but basically she topped off the hummus with some olive oil she placed some cooked chickpeas in the middle for decoration added a few dashes of paprika and topped it off with some nicely freshly chopped cilantro as a result this hummus became instagram worthy the final product was really delicious this homemade hummus is really nicer and much better than the store-bought one this is top-notch middle eastern restaurant quality type of hummus what i realized is the time that it takes to make hummus it all depends on your food processor unlike my food processor if you have a good quality food processor it should take you a good five to six minutes to make hummus it took me slightly longer because i had a really bad quality food processor if you do decide to make this hummus do tag me along in instagram i would really love to see how you did your hummus in the end i'm really happy how this recipe turned out i hope you guys enjoyed this video and i look forward to hearing your feedback in the comments below and if you enjoyed watching this video do remember to subscribe and give it a like that's it for now here's a b-roll of everything [Music] you", "9iY6LT_0iCs": "hi guys it's jennifer have you eaten yet you haven't let's get caffeine today we're making takkangchong takangjang is a street food version of yum chicken the fried chicken that's covered in spicy and sweet gochujang sauce just in case you don't like spicy food we are also making a honey garlic chicken sauce as well both are bite-sized and there are no bones to worry about for the chicken ingredients i'm using chicken breast today i would recommend you getting korean frying powder but if you can't get hold of any please use potato starch [Music] for the cheese sauce ingredients i've detailed it below and also available on the description yum yum sauce is spicy and sweet and the honey garlic is sweet and savory let's start by preparing the chicken dice the chicken into bite size we're going to pre-season the chicken with salt and pepper salt salt pepper pepper [Music] pour the milk into the chicken and soak for 30 minutes in the fridge [Music] today i'm going to prepare the chicken half with korean frying powder and the other half with potato starch just to see which one's better pour the korean frying powder into the chicken and milk bowl and make a batter it should be pretty thick to add the extra flakes on the chicken prepare a plastic bag with some korean frying powder and start dropping in the chicken bites once you put a few in add additional korean frying powder on top so when the next layer goes on top it doesn't stick together once everything is in make sure the bag is tied up on the top and give it a good shake shake shake shake take them out and they are ready to be fried look at all those flakes let's quote the chicken in potato starch take the chicken bites and coat them well one by one a bit different looking from the korean fried powder but let's see how they fry prepare a pan and add the oil in preheat between 160 to 170 degrees if you don't have a thermometer add a small piece of chicken and drop it into the oil count until five one two three four five if the piece comes up before three the oil is too hot turn off the heat to bring it down or add more oil [Music] when the oil is ready drop the chicken in one by one be careful and drop it close to the oil so it doesn't splash the secret to a good korean fried chicken is it's double fried the first deep fry is to cook the bite-sized chicken and it will take around two to three minutes don't overcrowd the chicken and wait for the chicken to start floating and that means it's all cooked [Music] after the first deep fry the potato starch is much more crispier than the korean frying powder [Music] in between the fries try and remove any leftover chicken flakes the second deep fry needs to be on a higher heat than the first one preheat between 170 to 180 degrees after you add the chicken in the temperature could increase higher so reduce the heat on the fire to maintain 170 to 180 degrees this is the frying where we are looking for color when the color is nice and golden take them out look at this after the second fry the korean frying powder is also so crispy it also has a bit thicker batter compared to the potato starch let me have a bite [Music] i had some rice cake left so i also fried it if you're using frozen ones be super careful and defrosted in advance and make sure all water is removed for the yanyon sauce prepare a pot and add soy sauce red pepper powder brown sugar ketchup red pepper paste corn syrup and minced garlic to the pan and mix well on medium heat bring the sauce to a boil and add the chopped peanuts we're all ready to serve add the chicken into a bowl and pour the sauce as much as you want and coat it well for the honey garlic sauce we need a wider pan and add brown sugar soy sauce cooking wine and corn syrup and mix well once it starts boiling turn off the heat and add the garlic peanuts and honey and mix once more throw in the chicken and mix well until it's well coated and honey garlic chicken after i mix the sauce the crispiness changed the korean fried powdered chicken kept the crispiness much better compared to the potato starch i'm actually a dipper so i like to dip my korean fried chicken into the yum yum sauce then coating it also enjoy the chewy rice cake with your fried chicken it gives a great texture thank you for watching and see you guys next time [Music] you", "iaPwV_esGHo": "So fun fact about me I actually gave up\ntraditional bread 10 years ago when I found out that I was

sandwiches go ahead and double this recipe and that\nway your slices will be a lot larger alright let's jump right in and get\nstarted to start I'm just gonna separate the egg whites from the egg yolks I'm\ngonna be using 6 organic eggs now try your best not to get any other yolks\ninto the egg whites if you get a little bit in there it's not a big deal but\nanyway the fastest way to do this is just to crack the egg and transfer the\nyolk back and forth into each shell and most of the egg whites will fall out now\nI'm gonna add some cream of tartar and using an electric hand mixer I'm just\ngonna whisk the egg whites until they form a foam like texture it should look something like this go\nahead and set the egg-whites aside and in a food processor I'm gonna add the\negg yolks about a third of the egg white mixture some grass-fed GE baking powder\na pinch of sea salt and some almond flour now I'm just gonna process this\nuntil it's fully combined once it's combined go ahead and add the rest of\nthe egg white mixture and now I'm just gonna pulse it a few times until the egg\nwhites are incorporated into the mixture but you want to make sure you don't\npulse it too many times because you don't want to over blend it and now I'm\ngonna grease a loaf pan with some avocado oil and just pour the mixture\ninto the pan we're gonna bake the bread at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30\nminutes or until it's fully cooked 3 now you want to make sure to let it cool\ncompletely before serving but yes I love this bread because it's flexible it\ndoesn't fall apart you can

cream so it's a coconut cheesecake frozen custard so the reason is called a frozen custard is because it's got egg yolks and this freeze is much better than a regular ice cream that's why i make frozen custards because they make a creamier ice cream so you could make a keto ice cream frozen custard doesn't require an ice cream machine which is great about it the normal ice creams will sometimes crystallize a little bit there is always ways around that but this one is so much easier you will see how it goes so let's go ahead and watch the recipe i'm going to use a mixture of fresh cream and coconut cream so about 3 4 cup of coconut cream and 1 whole and 1 4 cup of fresh cream you can take any proportion you like so you can take all coconut cream if you want it turns out really good i just wanted to go light on the coconut flavor but i think next time i'm going to go with whole coconut cream i've changed the pot now and now i'm adding 4 egg yolks i'm going to use the egg whites to make bread so whenever i make a frozen custard or something that uses egg yolks i also make a keto bread along with that so that i don't waste any of this so i'm using the last bit of all the egg yolk putting it in and since our cream is cold it's safe to mix our egg yolks at this point i've also added half a cup of cream cheese and as this warms up the cream cheese will melt and mix up in the mixture 1 4 cup of sweetener used monk fruit sweetener you want to use a little sweetener in the beginning and then adjust according to your liking so i'm going to give it a taste now so here i needed two more tablespoons so i've added that [Music] 1 8 teaspoon of salt and i'm gonna mix all of this and let this come to a boil once it boils it thickens and becomes a custard and you can see the custard is ready i'm going to pour this in this container and put it in the refrigerator for about four hours or so or until it thickens properly so that is done it's out of the refrigerator and take a look look at how thick it is and once your mixture is that thick it's very easy to make a lovely creamy ice cream so if you're making an ice cream with a custard mixture you will not get any crystallization before you forget i want to remind you to click the like button subscribe to my channel and click the notification bell on all notifications so that you're notified every time that i add a new recipe also don't forget to share this recipe with your friends and family i have also shared information about all the gadgets and the kitchen stuff that i love to use all of that is on my website and link to that is in the description too so in my case i'm using an ice cream machine here but if you have a frozen custard mixture mixture is not going to crystallize as much so you can just put it in the refrigerator for 8 hours or so and every 30 minutes or so use a hand blender to mix it together and put it back in the refrigerator in the freezer section of course my ice cream is ready i've put it in a container and look at how creamy and beautiful it is it's absolutely velvety and you will not make out that it's a keto ice cream and it's just as fatty and creamy like a keto ice cream but it tastes like a regular one so i hope you guys try it out trust me it's great this is the last bit of it and i'm going to scrape it out using a plastic or a wooden spatula always or you'll damage your pot if you want ice cream machine i have a link in the description check that out and i'm going to put this in the refrigerator for another hour that's when the texture is the best and look at that can you believe how beautiful it looks and these are a couple of coconut flakes because it's a coconut ice cream and look at how creamy it is this goes really well with my pecan pie recipe that's also keto recipe this is also keto recipe and they go really well together i had promised that i will share this recipe it got a little late i hope you guys will check both these recipes out and try them out let me know in the comment section how it turned out for you also share pictures on my social media handles all the information is in the description section and thanks for watching", "WlC6lj574ao": "[Music] hey everybody it's Alma welcome back to Quito meets menopause many of you guys have probably met Lori from fluffy Domo so Lori made some tuna patties and I said videotape it she did Thank You Lori and I said oh I've got plans man so I'm taking hers and I'm modifying it with what I have in the refrigerator why because I'm in the middle of a freezer to every challenge I got to get rid of what I got so that's I'm doing I took three packages of this pink salmon that I had in my pantry thank you buddy for leaving this for me and I have two of these pink salmon filet so that came out to be roughly 11 ounces I've added two large eggs trying to get better about including macros for everybody as well as the ingredients so we'll get that in there as well what we're going to add from here is one heaping tablespoon of mayo and two teaspoons horseradish she used with Dijon mustard they have a quarter cup of parmesan and I have three ounces of frying cheese it's in the upper right hand corner you'll find a link to a video that I did regarding frying cheese now I've already salt and peppered this to face as well there is such an individual thing guys I never want to tell somebody how much salt pepper they can use David wants me to add a ton I'm cool with to be on a medium level now Lori's recipe again it's slightly different and I'll leave a link at the right hand corner to Laurie's video as well now that's fine chief I'm hoping that you know it creates a little cheesy bite inside of it the way that Bryan cheese works is it gives a crust to the outer portions of what is cooked all right now Laurie doesn't have any veggies in her eye I'm adding to mine two ounces of celery two and a half ounces as a sweet peppers and one point two ounces of purple onion and a tablespoon of some psyllium husk and it will get some more fibers well I continue to mix I have my pan heating up with two heaping tablespoon of bacon drippings use what you like I believe Lord used olive oils hey Lori if you're watching what we know why you didn't use bacon drippings I've seen you save your drippings I know you use it so I think that that looks good I think that'll be okay so so what she does is she rolls the patty into the pork rind test what I've taken is two ounces of pork rinds ran through my processor and this is what you get just basic pour find us guys I'm not going to do giant Patty's and Lori just kind of cut them down for and then swap them and the mixture and then just kind of tax it [Music] that's pretty [Music] if you don't have a high enough guys that is when you'll notice that your patty will absorb more of the oil so the higher the setting the higher the bubble the less likely you're going to have a lot of saturation of oil I'm moving this all the way to a setting of seven out of ten Laurie says about three minutes per side so I've set my timer for three minutes and twenty seconds so it can do this without injury oh yeah hey guys y'all may sit there and say that's a burn that is how I have to put my husband food guys you've want a skull on it if there's not at all you've got happy true story and then you put on the fifth taste test before this is probably the golden color that Louie was talking about I'm not let it go a little bit longer if you've ever had crab cakes this is probably going to be about the same consistency as a crab cake there is a very timer it's been 2 minutes 20 seconds I give it up okay everybody so in the interest of science the balance of the pork rinds I am going to just see how it turns out so we're going to mix this together put it on the grill and just see which way we like better we've got the other patties ready to go [Music] that's the timer going for 2 minutes and 22 seconds now in Lori's recipe you'll notice that she actually put different spices in I omitted the spike simply because the horseradish law and all the veggies I didn't feel like it really needed a whole lot of extra feel free to add garlic powder onion powder do you name it I am going to sprinkle it with some delicious Cayenne I'm gonna do just the heck of it guys just for grins okay this last pattern that I'm going to see what happens to this in my airfryer but this is the way you like glory like that let me know how many of you guys cooking bacon dripping or what your favorite oil is to cook Emily cook on MCT oil because it will smoke up your entire house so it does not have a very high heat element okay so we're going to go ahead and flip it how's that look good so Laurie my sweet boy I'll be Nomo she made Jenica gonna cakes this one is perfect okay come here dude okay Laurie made tuna tea yes and I have altered it I'm salmon cakes ham and cheese asking I'm amazed you happen to see this so the one on your right has more of a skull I'll see ya and that has the pork rinds cooked on the outside of the tuna to the salmon that good was it the flaking Lamson can you show our viewing public it looks like a magic resign out of it I love this this is really good it's got a crispy outside texture yeah moist media inside I'm really like that okay now take the next one the next one just made differently I went ahead and made the remaining patties I wouldn't hit the floor fine in the mixture I'm doing tell a difference not much of a difference this one has a little bit more about I am a grown man I do not how the last thing is I made one would this for you guys you're fine this one here is from here fire thank this is for the air fire and to what it looks like it sound like a different with high so you're going to the bigger piece on at this one here fire dryer oh yeah in a different it's like the god of Salomon no it's definitely different right yeah it is and so there's no bacon drippings your banister didn't make a difference please don't work and I touched it throughout do you remember the pad balls you could buy what she did was grab all oh yeah I remember those red balls do you remember the sample that used to be able to buy at Long John Silver's Drance rent and stuff like that looks good what dishonor my baby other words don't my god I eat the ones you gave you can I have this one now no I don't buy what made you try the air fryer cuz I had one that was it man oh yeah me your review on the scale from one to five on the counting 1 to 5 I would say they're a solid for the reason they're not a 5 is because I like more salt you know what we have in my video I have it in my video saying it would definitely what more salt on is more salt in survive let's show a picture at the end and we'll go over the macros that way to do the conditioning all right I have a blessed day [Music]", "u6WHeHPo1Pg": "guess who just woke up from a nap you know i know you wish you could wake up for a nap and look this good but it's genetic it's a curse and i just had to learn to live with it i need to do this recipe before the day is out because i promised steve that i would uh gosh darn all right he's golfing we're gonna make a snickers cake and a mug another mug we're gonna do all week long hungry girl grab your water grab your tea grab your coffee grab your bloody mary if you're not gonna grab anything at all at least have your water okay let me show you the ingredients so easy so fast so delish these are your ingredients you need some devil's food cake mix some egg beaters some fat-free low-fat sour cream baking soda some fat-free low-fat light caramel dip now they we're talking about you know the little dips you have at halloween that you can put your apple in i'm not going to buy something just for one recipe when i have this it will do the job we need some chopped peanuts and some mini chocolate chips my husband chopped these peanuts for me before he went golfing that's how much he's looking forward to this recipe so let's get started all right here's the fun part is picking out a wide whoops a wide bottom mug now do you see up there at the very left the darkest mug that would be the most ideal but it's too far up this red one blue mickey's a good candid date we already used adventureland let me see if i can get that mickey down i could not get up there so know what we're gonna use it's a small world and this is apropos because this is my favorite mug i love this mug and it's got a nice wide bottom and it's saying goodbye so let's put her down there and let's get started all right we're going to start off by spraying the inside of our mug with some nonstick we're gonna put in our cake mix we're going to add our egg whites hi kitty dog what you doing we're gonna add our baking powder and our sour cream we're gonna mix it up which you guys probably don't have to see me do that so let me do this i also added two tablespoons of water you know that's one thing i've noticed with hungry girl recipes and i've mentioned it many times before the way that her little recipes are written out are kind of funky because it's said to put all the things together and then it had a period and then it said add two tablespoons of water and mix now why not just put it all at the same time all right so now we're gonna put it in the microwave for one minute or 40 and 45 seconds or until set now one thing i just want to remind everybody you know microwaves they vary man so i start off low give it a check not low but you know you know what i mean i don't put it the full amount check it all right there it is it's ready to go see how it's coming apart from the sides so nicely that's because nita over sprays because i don't like when it sticks and we're just going to give it a nice run along the sides and we are going to do this today we're using our fantasyland plate let's give it a shake of sugar uh-oh sugar sugar oh okay here we go here we go here we go all right we're good we're good all's good in the neighborhood all right we want to let it cool for 15 minutes right now we're going to finish it up it's nice and cool and ready to go my chocolate chips are measured out my peanuts are not it asks for one teaspoon so we'll take our teaspoon here and you know what i'm just gonna mix those together oh this is gonna be just like a snicker so this i have not measured out because it's just sticky i'm just gonna be careful with it but i don't want you to do that i want you to measure this out spray this with pam and do it correctly have the right amount of points okay so we're going to give it oh let's make it all pretty like and this is also this is um sugar-free the recipe calls for

you to family welcome back today we're gonna making low carb crackers if it's your first time with us don't forget hit the subscribe button below and above I can't say don't miss upcoming videos let's get started guys alright guys before you've started as a reminder everything I'm using today will be listed down in the description below and then at the end of the video will be a nutritional information car so you know what to expect as far as your macros going to eat these little crackers I hope this video finds all of you well right now we're going to cover 19 outbreak and it's winding down in some parts of the country but not all of them and I know I missed a couple videos there in the past week or two but I had been making face masks my local community here they put up the guidelines you want everyone wearing face masks so I'm trying to provide the need here so sorry I missed you but I'm back now I've made summer between three and four hundred mats of the past ten days so I think we're good now so this is a very simple very easy recipe that is actually my sister wall visited this last week and she has a lot of food allergy so I was trying to find stuff that could make for her that would still be cuter so the rest of us could either but that with her allergy she eat it too and this recipe was a hit everybody loved it you know even the nine key leaders in the realm so this is a really great recipe for anybody than having a snack attack and it just takes you a few ingredients so let's go start with this quick and simple recipe okay this is the first thing we're gonna do here is I have a tablespoon of chia seeds I'm gonna put them in a quarter cup of water here and we're gonna let this sit for five to ten minutes so that this is gonna gel up this one could be a binding agent this recipe doesn't have any cheese any eggs nothing like that in it so this two seeds are gonna be our binding agent thinking that a little bit of stir to make sure that all in the water so you'll know these are ready whenever you shake it in so just the rule is instead of jelly-like consistency okay so we're like that's it and we're back back in just a minute alright lovelies it's been about ten minutes and these cheese's have turned to a nice gel substance in here so they are ready go ahead the rest of the batter now in here I have a cup of sifted almond flour always make sure you sift your powders in your flour you don't want any lumps in there those would be unpleasant divided into okay and do that I'm gonna go ahead and start adding my other ingredients now this one this is an optional ingredient but I find it really does help with the flavor I have a teaspoon of nutritional yeast here and then I've got my seasonings I have a quarter teaspoon of cumin 1/4 teaspoon of pink Himalayan sea salt 1/4 teaspoon of no salt and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and you can adjust these seasonings a little bit here and there to your preference but I find this makes a really great cracker and then I want to add in a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and then we're gonna add the cheesy and that is all the ingredients for this that wasn't line this is such a simple recipe go mix this all together at first you were like there's no way this forms into a dough I promise you it does all right now I got all my ingredients mixed together I'm gonna set this aside for a second and I got a piece of parchment paper here and this fits my cookie sheet exactly that's pretty important when you're rolling out crackers because it's really bigger than a cookie sheet oh go up the sides and you end up either can the excess off or having some really wavy crackers my lightly sprayed this with some olive oil cooking spray I find that my crackers tend to stick to the parchment paper that's why I like to spray the bottom sheet I'm gonna put these out over a roll of nice and thin now this is where you want to kind of side what you're gonna be using these crackers for if you just want some really crispy crackers to eat by themselves you want a world just really thin like paper thin but if you're gonna dip this in something like guacamole our salsa you don't want them too thin the kids and they just kind of break off and they're done they're not great for dipping we tried it both way so I came to you that's how you want to pay attention to how thick of how thin your world is so came the second sheet of parchment in front we're just gonna roll these out now we are going to be using these to dip luckily in with dinner tonight so I'm not gonna make them too terribly thin I'm gonna leave that like right back with you cuz though is so much easier to roll out than I am cheese it recipe up there that fat head that was so tough to roll out even working by clearly fifty minutes this just rolls right up nice and easy for you alright so I just finished rolling these out and looking up from the side they're probably about a millimeter to two millimeters thick so it's not paper thin but it's not thick either you make them too thick they're not gonna crisp up so if you have a chrome with yours getting crispy make sure you're not rolling them too thickly so you can cut these in whatever shapes you want since my family's convinced these taste just like we thins I cut them in the rectangular shape place whatever you prefer squares triangles rectangles star bowls if you desire it's whatever you want see I use a pizza cutter to cut these I find that it's the absolutely easiest way all right how's our cut we're gonna come on the cookie sheet that's okay now I'm going to and I'm boy fell in the oven we're gonna top him there's some pink Himalayan sea salt here and I know my daughter loves it when I put everything bagel seasoning on these right here i person for just sea salt but she loved it so much I'm gonna do this for her hope you asked my daughter she'll say that everything bagel seasoning make anything taste good alright and these are now ready to go into the oven I've already got the oven preheated to 400 degrees I'm gonna put them in and these things will cook for any word 8 to 12 minutes depending on your oven what I do is I put it in for 8 minutes and check them if the ones on the very outside edge are done I will take them off and let the center once continue cooking some ones on the outside it will get done first if you rolled yours really thin just really keep it closed um I would start at like six or seven minutes peeking in making sure they don't burn they will burn quickly alright put these in the oven I'll see how back in just a minute alright guys we're back so these cooks for a total of about 12 minutes at 8 minutes I peeked in and took the ones off the edges that were already cooked I didn't want them to burn and then of the right side to continue cooking they're kind of hot right now so I'll take them off in just a minute but these are so delicious definitely got the crunch to them all right so these gonna had a few minutes to cool or go ahead and pop them off and if you cut these with a pizza cutter it makes it so easy they barely just barely come off just like that and then a cute little rectangular shape they don't pop all these off all right lovely so that is it for these they are all done and ready to serve if you enjoyed this recipe don't forget give me a thumbs up down below and feel free to share this recipe with Amy that you know can music go to low carb cracker / chip recipe thanks for joining me guys I'll see y'all next time bye [Music]", "OlDnjLJaC8M": "hello everyone welcome to la vez today we're going to show you guys a garlic pull-apart bread from our favorite recipe trader at Cato chicks on instagram and we can't wait to get into it but before we do make sure that you hit that subscribe button we post the new keto recipes every single week and show you guys exactly what we think about them so Becca will show you how it's made we've had this garlic bread saved for a while now and I'm super excited to finally get to taste it so we're basically gonna be making the dough and then we get to make a garlic butter to go like right on top of it so super excited so the first thing you're gonna do is to preheat the oven to 300 and Eydie doing in this bowl we have one and a half cups of sifted on flour add in one teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt so we're using a variation of Fathead dough so of course we're gonna be using some cheese so first we have two and a half cups of shredded mozzarella and add in 2/3 cups of powdered parmesan now I'm not our cheese in the microwave for 30 seconds twice so I just looked in two directions and you're actually not supposed to add the parmesan and yet you're supposed to add the two ounces of cream cheese so we're just gonna add that in put it back into the microwave and then we'll just add more [Music] all right so here's what we got now we'll add in our almond flour mixture now add in three eggs [Music] [Music] I can't do it like the little Spencer so now I'll separate these into balls and dredge them in a powder and ground [Music] so this would be the part where we take two teaspoons of garlic powder and two thirds cup of Parmesan cheese and mixed it together but since we already have the parmesan into our mixture we're just gonna dredge it in big garlic [Music] [Music] ten minutes before your garlic bread is done in the oven we're gonna make a garlic butter mixture to go on top first we have a half cup of melted butter add in two tablespoons of minced garlic and add in one tablespoon of minced parsley [Music] we make keto garlic bread oh my god looks really good oh it's falling apart wait we have to clean I saw some more yeah it looked like you've liked it I loved it oh my god even with our like mess up with the Paragon yeah good on the outside of it it tends like crisp up but then when you bite into it it's just so soft oh my god it's so much better than regular garlic bread I remember my mom Issa by the ones that you put into the oven they're already whole in there frozen I mean I thought those were okay they're not people should be eating that what do you think about it compared to like the garlic sticks we made remember oh yeah I don't think there's any competition with this true facts yeah okay the garlic sticks they were good but they're also one very thin yeah they're kind of floppy and they're supposed to be a little crisper I think like those garlic sticks that we made are more my style but all the butter just the spices and this one just made it so much better that I still like it more than that yeah and I like that you have like a garlic butter you slather it on top and it just like soaks into everything yeah we didn't use it all but I kind of want to know well I'm trying to make I'm trying to make chicken parm with these so I think I'll just just lid on there oh yeah what would you give it for flavor um a thumbs up me too of course delicious thank you sexy um thumbs up now is there anything that you would change about the texture maybe more like almond flour if anything yeah make it a little more like bread lake yeah yeah maybe that everything that we've had from her has been absolutely delicious and not only delicious it's always been like original it's always been something that I've

pumpkin spice mug cake so i can't wait to show this to you it's amazing you're gonna love it it's perfect for the fall and for those of you that are pumpkin spice lovers like myself because i swear i'm i'm pumpkin spice obsessed so um you're gonna love this let's go over um you know what we're gonna be using i have all my ingredients set out here you're gonna definitely need your mug because you know you need your mug i'm just using a clear mug so that you guys can see inside it but we're going to start off by mixing our dry ingredients so we're going to do our almond flour and you're just going to pour everything right into your mug so we'll do almond flour then we have our sweetener i'm using powdered sweetener but if you have granular you can totally use granular or you can even blitz it like in your a little coffee grinder a blender or even a food processor so then we have our little baking powder and don't worry at the end of the video i'm gonna have a screenshot for you guys to take of all the ingredients okay and here we have our pumpkin spice then we have our cinnamon okay and now come the wet ingredients so let's just do a little mix here so that you guys can see just get all the little chunks out okay that's good enough these mug cakes are forgivable like they um you know they're really really easy to make i mean if you put the wet first you're gonna be just fine but i like to do the um you know i like to do the dry and then the wet then here we have some pumpkin puree so this is not pumpkin pie this is pumpkin puree okay because the pumpkin pie has a ton of carbs um so we did that and here we have our little heavy cream so let's just go ahead and pour this bad boy in there and let's get all of it because we need a tablespoon and then let's go ahead and mix so you just get your little fork and you'll see how everything just mixes really well oh my god it smells so good smells like fall i swear i'm like one of those crazies that just loves all the pumpkin everything so stay tuned for the rest of my pumpkin spice recipes um once you see that everything is starting to look almost like a you know like a cake batter then we know it's ready we just need a tiny bit more because the egg you know you want to make sure that the egg is is definitely um incorporated and if you guys want this to be dairy free all you have to do is substitute the heavy cream for coconut coconut cream i've never tried it with a fat flax egg i'm not you know but i mean if you guys do please let me know if it turns out because i know this could be vegan if it had um a flax egg and then the coconut cream but anyway here is our batter let me show you it looks you know something like this this is what the consistency that you're looking for and now we're just gonna go ahead and microwave this okay so we're gonna microwave this for 90 seconds i'm going to show you what it looks like and then we are going to make our glaze okay so we're going to put it in for a minute and a half and so all microwaves are different um you want to just make sure that it's not like gooey or anything like that but for the most part a minute and a half should work i'm gonna put that in and i will show you what it looks like when it's done okay let's see oh beautiful so see there's no um wetness going on you still want it to be moist but you don't want it to be like raw so yeah let's turn it over and then we're making our glaze so now i'm just getting a knife here to make sure that it's not stuck which i can tell it's not and we're just going to flip it over and voila look at that how beautiful it smells so good guys okay so we're going to set this little guy aside and now what we're going to do is make our glaze okay so for the glaze it's very simple you just need heavy cream cream cheese some sweetener now there's two things you can do here if you have sugar-free pumpkin spice syrup then you could use that instead of the sweetener and any seasonings okay but if you do not have the pumpkin spice um syrup then you would get your tablespoon of sweetener i'm using powdered sweetener remember you can make that in your blender or your food processor our cream cheese with this will have to be warmed up right now but um here let's do that first so we will put the cream cheese in with the little heavy cream and let's go ahead and put this into the microwave okay so it's just like 30 30 seconds um you just want to make sure that it's warm so that everything mixes in well okay so we have our mixture it's nice and warm so it's going to mix really easily okay and now what we're going to do is we're going to so in here we have our cream cheese and our heavy cream now let's add our sweetener okay and this is raw batter so we're not gonna use that then let's go ahead and add our pumpkin spice so i just got this one at traders you know we're gonna do a quarter teaspoon and we're also going to do a quarter of the phenomena so that's why if you do have the um if you have the syrup then you don't need this stuff because the flavor is already in there but i'm showing you guys in case you don't have it this is how you would make it okay and now obviously you just want something a little smaller than this huge spatula but it's what i have right now so let's go ahead and mix i might need to get a little fork to make sure it all mixes well okay so let's go ahead we're just going to be pumpkin on pumpkin if you want to just make this this is obviously like a cream cheese glaze if you want it without the pumpkin flavor you can do that as well but and just you would still add the cream cheese heavy cream and sweetener so it's coming together you're just gonna um keep mixing until it's all well incorporated and i'll show you what that's going to look like right now i wanted to mention to you if you're like pumpkin obsessed then you're gonna you know be totally fine with this frosting if you want something a little more plain then just omit the pumpkin spice and the cinnamon and still do the cream cheese the whipped cream and the sweetener okay but i'm doing it like so because i'm telling you i could just like pour it all on me um the last thing we're gonna do is just add a little bit of whipped cream of course it's totally optional you can buy a sugar-free one from the store you can buy even a regular one and just count about two net carbs for it but i have this bad boy here um which i have it linked on my amazon this is just if you're you know gonna use it for like drinks and cakes and whatever the case um then you would just buy this this guy here but um so i'm not like all professional i'm gonna try and not make a huge mess here but we're just gonna add a little on the let's see it goes softly [Music] oh okay i almost put too much but anyway ah hold on it's starting to fall okay anyway so what we're gonna do now is a taste test but of course the whipped cream is optional but here we are guys this is our little um pumpkin spice mug cake so let's go ahead and cut in though because it's about that time and you guys already know that this is just my absolute favorite part of this entire video and let's look inside how's that looking you guys see that beauty let's go ahead and taste it i already know it's gonna be bomb but i'll do the taste test for you guys and you would want to drink this with maybe some you know almond milk with a little splash i'm gonna show you guys how i make my milk because it's just a game changer ever since i figured it out it was just like game changer anyway so here we go best bite it's almost like a cakey pumpkin pie that's just so if you love pumpkin pie i'm telling you right just go make it right now you're gonna be so obsessed this is delicious it has you know it's nice and moist and then you have the creaminess from the glaze and then of course the whipped cream boom boom boom boom we're gonna stop there because i will finish this i'm not even joking um i'm going to put all the ingredients for you guys so you guys can just take a screenshot it'll be easy you guys can go buy all the ingredients most of these things you have at home the only thing might be like the pumpkin pie spice um the pumpkin puree other than that it's everything that we use for all the other mug cakes and you know most recipes on on keto so anyway i hope you guys really enjoyed this recipe there's so much more that i'm gonna be sharing with you that has the pumpkin spice um you know flavor to it because i'm so obsessed but let me know in the comments below if you're a pumpkin spice lover or you absolutely hate it and trust me i won't get offended but i like to know because obviously these recipes are for you guys and if you guys just aren't pumpkin spice fans then i will figure out you know other desserts that um that are you know fall inspired so guys thank you so much for joining me i love you guys and i will see you on my next video [Music] you", "PlS6xCtuAQU": "[Music] grading with my beautiful lovelies it's Emmy welcome back today I'm gonna be peeling garlic now many of you probably have already seen this video because it's gone viral but it was shared on Twitter by Valentina about Korova Lorde on Twitter and she shows a very interesting and novel way to peel garlic she just uses a paring knife she stabs the close of garlic through the skin and just pops each clove out just popping it out very kind of similar in terms of satisfaction and novelty as the pineapple peeling video if you haven't seen that video up with a link above and down below in that video I took the pineapple didn't peel it didn't do anything but just separate it via the segment's just peeled each little segment off and just eat it that way last night I went to the supermarket and I bought all the types of garlic I could find including this loose variety here and this kind that comes in a sack that looks a little bit smaller and these ones which they're calling jumbo which don't look to be all that much bigger than these so to give this a fair shot I thought I'd try all the varieties that I could find now garlic also known as Allium sativum is in the alum family now there are two basic types of garlic hard neck and soft neck this is a hard neck variety it's difficult to see but this stock is very very hard soft Nick on the other hand you can braid the stalks and plate them and you often see them kind of hanging decoratively let's see what these varieties are here so from what I could tell in the video she's using a hard neck variety this might be hard look as well the stock has been cut so yes see this is a hard necklace so this is a soft neck variety as you can see the stock here is soft if you've never grown garlic before it's really really simple you just get yourself a head of garlic break the cloves up and then just bury them into the soil probably a good couple of inches you want to do this in the fall and then you'll harvest the next year you can also plant the cloves in the spring but your bulbs of garlic not be as big and then spring you'll start seeing little green shoots pop up and they look a bit like green onions or scallions some varieties will actually put up something called escape which comes all the way up and then does this beautiful kind of curly cue those are delicious you harvest those because you want most of the energy to go down into the bulb of the garlic because that's what you're growing but the scapes are absolutely delicious you probably spot them at farmers markets in this springtime and they're really simple to cook you just chop them up and then you just stir fry them they taste a little bit like asparagus but they've got this really nice garlicky flavor to them much much milder than the bulb itself so garlic's aromatic potency is legendary there's even believed to at one time deter vampires but also used in the garden to deter pests and insects including slugs so garlic is in the Allium family which also includes onions and shallots but of everything garlic has the most sulfur compounds and one of these whole four compounds is AMS allyl methyl sulfide it is not digested it's a volatile liquid and it can go into your bloodstream and then through your lungs and then be emitted through your mouth causing bad breath isn't that great it even is believed to come out through your pores so you can even smell of garlic long after you've eaten it isn't that fascinating garlic I love garlic garlic is so useful it's so tasty it's so versatile it lasts a long time it's easy to grow and now let's try to peel it using a knife so I first learned about this video about a week ago on Twitter but in that time several other people have chimed in about their opinions attempting this trying this including the New Yorker and The Guardian and I will put all the links down in the description so in The New Yorker article Helen Rosner actually has a few pointers about this which I really appreciate because now I will use her advice so Helen remarks on a few things she says where you place the knife is important number 2 she says there's also a technique in cracking and loosening the clove from the stem and number 3 and perhaps most importantly she says that using a finger to brace the clove of garlic before you crack it is really important too the clove from breaking in half so Helen thank you so much for all of those pointers so I noticed in the video that the skin of the garlic seems to be very very thin so I suspect that some peeling has happened like this to expose the cloves all the stuff they don't show it in the video that makes it work right meanwhile in the time that it's taken me to just peel this paper Riis stuff off I've already smushed my garlic clove and I'm chopping it with my knife already you know the conventional way but we're not testing that are we dip the tip of the knife place it in there and just pry it out you know just pry it out films us to twist and pry to separate from the stem haha look at that so I did get the clothes off but I do still have to do that hey that almost worked that was the first one let's try the next one I'm also holding the bulb with the stock facing down upside down see this little hump here I'm going to stick the knife into there give it a twist and pluck it out right just pluck it out right just pluck it right out so that one didn't work either when she did it she did it in a counterclockwise fashion so let's support it with my back finger here let's plunge it in there and separate it from the stock and then yeah kind of works and then kind of puncture it out no I'm going to try a knife with a little bit wider blade give it a twist so it separates it but it's not really pulling it out of my hands are going to smell lovely so here's a little tip if you've got garlic hands which I'm definitely gonna have a little bit of stainless steel really helps if you've got a stainless steel sink just rub your hands inside the stainless sink or if you've got a stainless steel pot just rub your hands on that with water and somehow the stainless steel neutralizes the smell of garlic it really works if you've got a stainless steel straw if you rub that onto your tongue it really does neutralize the flavor of garlic try it try it it works ok back to this so I'm having kind of mixed results with this this is kind of working better using a bigger knife so stick it in ooh ooh oh that won't work did you see that okay that worked alright let's try that again stick it in support it pop it out nope so for the bigger cloves it doesn't work as well I don't think I got to get the wrist action so ya know I think also because that clove is kind of buried not so much I am giving lots of peeled garlic hmm I've got flying garlic so mixed results there but I think there is a bit of a learning curve let's try the smaller variety again I'm gonna peel the paper off stick it in pop it out pop it out no not pop it out okay maybe the first one doesn't work that well stick it in give it a twist okay there we go you use your middle finger just pork the clove of garlic in the holding hand plunge this in here and kind of click it and separate it give it a little wiggle and that will separate it from the stock give it a little wiggle then you can pull that out that's the technique stick the knife in wiggle it a little bit to break it from stop and then keep wiggling it and then it just kind of separates that it totally works does it save much time I think it depends on how much time you're willing to put into honing your skill doesn't work every time though there so that was a garlic that came out of this small netted bag a hard neck variety smaller in size than the large loose let's try this variety which was the Jumbo but these are soft net so it looks like the soft neck is working too but it doesn't separate so nicely from the main stock let's try that again yeah it doesn't want to separate from this the central stock is easily kind of like when you have clingstone peaches versus non cling stones you can still get it out but doesn't come out as satisfying Marie oh this one's doing it so maybe it does come off well I've got a little bit of paper so maybe it does work with soften actually let's try it still works a soft neck look you cut this open you'll see that there's a green sprout coming this is an older garlic this is going to be a new garlic plant so if you're going to be using this particularly if you're going to be using it for raw purposes if you're gonna be making say a dip of some kind or salad dressing remove this little germ remove it on both pieces because that will make your dip or your sauce very spicy so I think there's another technique that is better and it's using two bowls unpeeled garlic I've got lots of that two bowls ah well it mostly worked so that technique peeled about half of the garlic I still would prefer using this technique rather than plucking with the knife technique how to peel garlic with a knife it does work does it work better does it work efficiently no but it does work so if you've got a lot of garlic and some time on your hands and you want to try it I definitely would recommend trying it because it is really novel and satisfying to pull the whole garlic clove out but as a technique that I would regularly use in my kitchen has all singsong alrighty thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you guys enjoyed that one I hope you guys learn something please share this video with your friends follow me on social media like this video subscribe and I shall see you in the next one tiddly take care bye wow if you could smell my kitchen right now", "1zqcRrhyb5Y": "this is a really big deal for two reasons one because I'd like to dethrone a reigning king of curly fries and two because we are now going to debut the first episode while technically second of but better yes that is what I decided to name this series this is episode one which I'm actually this is the first official episode of but better which is a series where we will be taking the most coveted fast foods the ones with the most cult following and remaking them and doing our best to not only make them better but making them better by using technique and proper cooking skills with real ingredients none of them no cutting corners completely from scratch really excited about this that's a really long description I think I've taken about my time you get the idea we're making curly fries and we're gonna do our best to compete with Arby's now let's see who can win this yeah so we got the bag I'm not gonna lie it has been a while since I've had these so one thing I will say there Chris penis is already 86 which I'm kind of surprised about all right you know it's only been like 10 or 15 minutes North Sloan's flavor wise we're good I mean the first example is that they do this you know crispy fries don't don't do that I think I've got it okay so I think the shape of these alone are a little bit intimidating this method is way easier than I thought it was gonna be so we're gonna get the shape you're gonna need a spiralizer with the curly fry attachment I'll have a link for the one that I have here now let's talk about potatoes so you're gonna use russet potatoes I really like that high starch content for extra crispy nests but when you're choosing one don't use a gigantic potato they do not spiral eyes well you're gonna get sad thin shreds that make you want to sob into your potato ribbons no good so you can sort of choose a medium smallish one you don't leave the skin on and for a three to four serving portion you're only gonna need about three russet potatoes now look it's real simple you put your curly fry attachment on you put your flipping potato on the spiralizer you stick this butt end in the tube thing that's gonna make sort of a wiener shape unfortunately you'll see in a second and then you're gonna stab the back in with this now make sure to fix this on a surface that's not gonna make it slide around this suctions down and then well you just turn it and press it real freaking hard while you're turning real fast and well that's well that's it you got curly fries that's all you gonna do it what do you think I was gonna have you pull your knife out and do this now once you spiralized all three of your potatoes you're then gonna cover them with two and a half quarts or 2.25 liters of warm water and to that you're gonna add two and a half tablespoons or 25 grams of kosher salt then just mix it up and let them soak for 30 minutes so this does two things a it helps wash the starch off and B it's getting kind of brine in a little bit you get some sort of salt penetration doesn't sound great but you know what I mean don't like I said every time I tried these I feel like there's some sort of a batter going on so that's what we're gonna make so in a separate bowl you're gonna combine half a cup or 80 grams of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of kosher salt 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of smoked paprika 2 tablespoons or 19 grams of ancho powder 1/2 a teaspoon or 1 gram of cayenne powder and half a tablespoon or seven grams of garlic powder whoo all right it's a lot of a lot of things I got it we set together and then carefully whisk in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water until you got well sort of like a loose batter going there now once you're done soaking you're then going to fill a heavy-bottomed pot with frying oil now this is a 5 quart oh by the way this is a new pot did you see that old Bessie is no more does anyone so kisses to Bessie anyway do not fill this more than a little over halfway now go ahead and heat that or oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 175 degrees Celsius while it's heating you can remove your curly fries from their soaking liquid and make sure to also cut them into manageable pieces I mean they're gonna be super duper long so you know cut them into reasonable lengths then just shake off the excess water and then place them in your bowl with your batter once all the fries are in there give them a little toss you know get to shake them round Cottam coat them nicely and evenly okay so now comes to frying partner these are gonna fry super violently because they're coated in a liquidy batter so what do you expect you know water and hot oil not your best friend so please be careful now take a little bit of your fries out of the batter gently shake off any excess batter and then and then carefully lower them into your temp toil and then you're simply just gonna fry them for about four to five minutes or until crispy in nice and well golden red in this case now please start with a small batch of fries don't do them all at once because this is going to foam up a lot when it fries I hold no liability for any mistakes you make all right now once you're nice and golden and crispy you're then gonna transfer it to a baking sheet lined with a RAK let lee season it with salt and I added a little bit of a leper pepper on top as well just you know some extra texture and flavor and then just let them cool down until you can put them in your mouth and well yeah actually that just repeat that process with the rest of your fries and that is literally it that's all you have to do there's no double frying with this method it's literally one and done brother all right so well yeah that's it let's let's taste test and yes again I added a little bit of black truffle for the Flex I don't wanna hear anybody going it's cheating Josh you can't be Gilly yeah yeah well I did it anyway and I tasted it before I added the truffle and that is the opinion we're gonna go with wanted the truffle lean alone oh and before we taste sessom decide the winner here's a little black truffle mail I made to go with this so it's gonna be 1/4 cup or 60 grams of mayonnaise half of a small grated black winter truffle which is about 17 grams 2 cloves of grated fresh garlic 1 small bunch of chives finely chopped a splash of fish sauce and black pepper to taste fine ground mix that together and you got a little you know dipping sauce that is mind-boggling before we uh so we're obliterate this let's always cleanse the palate got mine here's how they sound with B whoa oh yeah oh yeah so visually I person thing might look better I like the darker red it's more dramatic looking and they're a little bit thinner which I kind of like so our competitor tastes slightly undercooked they're dry on the other hand mine fluffy on the inside risk beyond this I mean here's this flavor level and then here's this flavor level you can't even see this one this is like out of frame the smoky paprika all right all right enough I think we did it kids i guess 'sir bringing people on here to taste these cuz ya'll are gonna start yelling at me and being like Josh you always say yours wins you fine we'll start bringing in taste testers to verify that I'm always right so out of that little corkscrew but do you want to know what else is a corkscrew that you should look at you [Music] [Music] alright guys and that is it so I really got to bring some people on here to be taste testing this stuff because it's a little hard to take it seriously but I mean come on like a look at it you eat with your eyes first okay and if your eyes say ooh daddy likey daddy want yum yum not good not not a good one I was weird but if your eyes do say daddy want yum yum probably that's where the yum yum is just to be completely honest with you uh yesterday I got off the phone with somebody that you guys have been wanting us to do something together for a very very long time we had a wonderful conversation

is as soft as always which can be kneaded by machine or by hand Don't miss it Let\u2019s make the dough first add bakers flour, sugar, salt and instant yeast in a mixing bowl pour in eggs and milk I leave a little bit of milk and don\u2019t pour in Let's see how the flour forms a dough After mixing at low speed for about 1 minute, the dough is formed Check if the dough is too soft or hard If it feels a little dry, pour in the remaining milk Continue to mix for 1 minute until the dough is just right Because different regions and different brands of flour have different water absorption it is recommended that you increase or decrease the amount of liquid a little each time Turn to a medium speed and continue to mix  Savour bread dough has less sugar and fat content  so it is not easy to stick to the bottom After mixing for about 7-8 minutes gluten has started to form the dough is easily broken when it is pull slowly and easy to tear apart Add softened butter The butter must not be melted Press lightly and show an indentation is just right Continue mixing at medium speed Use a scraper to scrape off the dough and butter sticking to the sides and bottom About 7-8 minutes later the dough has very good elasticity  and it will not easily break when stretched.  Take a small piece of dough for windowpane test stretch out and not easy to break Even if it is broken, the edges of the hole are smooth Fold the dough toward the bottom After mixing, the dough is not sticky to the mixing bowl and hand the surface of the dough is very smooth Spray a little oil in the bowl to prevent sticking, cover with plastic wrap and ferment until doubled in size in a warm place We use garlic butter to make garlic bread Pour the softened butter into a bowl, scrape it with a spatula until smooth add salt and sugar, mix well, add a little sugar to reduce the spicyness of the garlic  Grate 6-7 cloves of garlic After all ingredients mix, pick some fresh parsley leaves, wash and chop them The fragrant garlic butter is done It's already spring in Australia and the dough has doubled its size after being left at room temperature for over an hour to see if the dough is properly developed poke a hole in the middle. If it does not collapse and the indentation remains, it means that the fermentation is just right If the dough looks like a leaky ball, which means it's overproved No need to knead, divide the dough into 7 equal parts, each about 70 grams  By folding and rounding, the bubbles in the dough are squeezed out  If the bubbles remain in the dough the surface of the bread will be affected after final proof Round with both hands at the same time to form a ball shape with a smooth surface. The sealed side face down Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 15 minutes The smooth side faces down, use the knuckle to pat the dough until the air bubbles are removed Pat into a flat round shape with a diameter of about 10 cm Press the two sides to the inside and roll up The middle part will bulge, like an olive shape Seal side faces down Let's take a quick look at how to shape again Place all doughs on a baking sheet lined with baking paper Leave some space between the doughs  to allow the doughs to rise. Put it in the oven for final proof  I set the oven to 35C/95F, put a bowl of hot water and spray water to make the humidity reach between 75-85% Use a themometer and hygrometer If the humidity drops during the period, spray more water  otherwise the dough surface will dry out and it will affect the dough rising  It takes about 50 minutes for final proof The dough is very soft When you press the surface gently the dents will slowly rebound Preheat the oven to 170C/340F Dust with flour on surface for easy slashing I use this type of blades for men\u2019s razor which was bought in the supermarket, usually a pack of 10 pieces, very sharp.  Slash quickly  or it is easy to appear jagged or the dough collapses The blade is perpendicular to the dough, and the cut will open wide a bit Let it sit for a few minutes Put the garlic butter in a piping bag If the butter is getting hard, heat it in the microwave for 5 seconds to soften  Squeeze on the cut Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese powder on top Place on the lower rack of the oven, bake at 170C/340F for 20 mins The kitchen is full of garlic butter fragrance when it is baked Put it on a cooling rack and let the bread cool down  The smell of garlic is really irresistible, and the bread is extremely soft Heat in the microwave for 10-15 seconds  for breakfast on next day, and it will be as delicious as when it is baked You can make the garlic bread at home and don\u2019t forget to upload your work to my facebook I am Lisa, if you like my video please do not forget to like and subscribe.

between this and B love seafood sauce out now that's sneaky good food how you think you think you think my girlfriend hello do you want to eat [Music] [Music] [Music] what's up y'all welcome back to our channel I just jumped on one cuz I'm getting ready to have a heck of a dinner so I just wanted to just eat with you guys unless you know what I did this is Kido approve I'm just gonna jump into it cuz I'm starved all day I've been ripping and running in this house quarantine style okay so I'm hungry do you have any probably thinking project for yet another day we thank you Lord we love you Lord so very much in Jesus name we pray amen whoa okay so what I have here is a cheesy hot - a cheesy fettuccine alfredo with broccoli and chicken sorry I'm talking to my knees - yes I am using miracle noodles made from the konjac Flint I've used these before when I made keto spaghetti so I decided to do a keto fettuccine and um yeah I'm just I'm about to just jump in so close I'm starving I really am first of all this is delicious these noodles mmm you have to get used to because they're really chewy they don't have a flavor if you follow all the steps that I follow them and preparing them they don't have a flavor so you have to you know the surrounding flavors will kind of give it flavor so but they're really chewy so you have to take your time don't rush to like chew and swallow so what I have been feeling for pasta and if you are on keto or thinking about Tito you either already know what I'm talking about or get ready to know what I'm talking about because whoa it gets real um all these ingredients I got from my local grocery store um just one that's close to me and mmm but for the shrimp I like the shrimp from The Fresh Market I love that store it's kind of like Whole Foods and put you in the mindset of Whole Foods so they have this colossal shrimp there that I usually they don't have it I usually have to order it but they have some so I'm so happy about that and I have that here now as far as the shrimp goes these are um butter garlic shrimp and I have the parmesan the same parmesan that I'm using for my afraid oh I'm going to be using for my shrimp but I infuse the butter garlic sauce into it as well because that sauce is off that sauce is too good to let it go to waste so the remaining sauce I just dipped off up in there dip off up in there you know something this right here is good I'm gonna be doing in a couple days I'm gonna be doing another keto spaghetti as well with angel hair miracle noodles I'm good I'm really good but just remember to chew okay chill the noodles up before swallowing cuz they're they're really chewy they're very chewy I was saying I would not serve this to my daughter because she I will just be could you really have to you have to chew it up it's not have to chew it up and the mother in me will be so nervous I will be sitting here like this the whole time making sure she is chewing it up mm-hmm just broccoli is tough just a steamed broccoli like steamed in the bag broccoli tastes nine expensive meal you guys well the shrimp was like thirty bucks I think four pounds something like that but as far as the UM alfredo those it was not expensive at all [Music] and um hmm The Fresh Market they clean the vein the whole night so when I receive them they were already cleaned and deveined which I appreciate that something just don't do it they don't go that extra mile so for the ones that do I really appreciate that of course you know I go through and I clean off anyways but just the fact that they did that I appreciate it I wasn't really sure how it was gonna be this is my first time using alfredo sauce as a dipping sauce for my ceb\u00fa so I was like let me just see let me just know I don't know because I added that zing of butter garlic in here or what but mm-hmm Wow I'm pleasantly surprised mmm a bit soft the man is so blunt I'm gonna say to miss my hugger hmm some of that butter sauce mmm good I was glad there's a good man oh you guys so back to chemo after our wedding faded off of quito for a while honestly I just wanted to eat what I want to eat I was in marital bliss it was like I'm married I'm not gonna not marry so there you go but I will say in doing that I still watch my carbs and sugar I just naturally do that now whether I'm in ketosis or not so I didn't gain any weight I just maintain my weight so that's what I really appreciated about Kido it's kind of um it's just taught me a lot about nutrition and the things that I can and cannot eat or I can eat it but I might have attitude about it later it's taught me a whole lot so so I got up again for a couple months and I couldn't either it's harder on it a little bit but wasn't really too serious until probably about two weeks ago and then I was like let me stop playing guns out here in these kiddos streets because I love the results it works um do your research of course but it works he knows great I'm always happy with the results so I try to drink for the other day to get my gallon Cheetos not something that you should go back and forth on I do want to mention that but I have a a go away I had a wedding go away which I did reach and then I have an ultimate go away although I got to where I wanted to get for the wedding I wasn't finished I was just kind of like my Midway mark so um the good thing about that is I know how to maintain my weight now so that's something that I've always struggled with so once I've reached my target weight then I'll be done I'll just be maintaining after that and I am working out at least three times a week before when I was doing Kido I was not working out well I started out doing my power walks but then I was like I wanna see if you can still lose weight without exercising because I see that question a lot not that I'm an advocate for not exercising I love the benefits of exercising I'm not saying don't exercise but I see that question a lot in regards to keto so I wanted to see if I can reach my target goal without working out and I did so I lost like 30 pounds and I don't know how many months like four three something like that but I don't know like people were the first month they lose like 20 20 pounds a month no it definitely works you guys are so good one of them I'm gonna trade drawbacks I won't say drawbacks but and one of the side effects of Kido is getting pool so quickly moves when you eat and good hello do you want to eat but then Kido comes along and says not so aunty Kido comes to the house and stares ma'am put the fork down you're finished and you be like no joke I'm telling you no Joe no Joe no Joe no Joe no no turn it this is lemon water let's say you know mmm dad won't get really full very quickly oh let me tell you about the sauce tube I'm there's three grams of carbs and there's one gram of fiber so there's like two net carbs in this and also there's less than one gram of sugar and no added sugar so 8 grams of fat 1 gram of protein but I have chicken in there too kind of up that protein but remember it's keto so you want to do moderate protein you don't want to do super high protein because you are going to gain weight or you're gonna stay and you're gonna wonder hey I'm doing Kido so why would you why would you even y'all sometimes I get these notifications and it'll be like you spent something something something at Google what but it's just all the stuff that I have that go through monthly and then you forget until you are like that corn life hits you and then you be like hold up what am i spending my money on hold up then you go through and check good you want to check it before when all everything was cool now you check it like do I really need this I think I'm a hit up one of these not every alfredo sauce is good period people act like our Fredo sauce is just it comes from the heavens good it already like as soon as you see the jar it's all good I've had plenty of not good alfredo sauce I hate to burst the low but it needs to be bursted and now if I had a choice between this and B love seafood sauce I would probably choose B love stuff but I love the size of these shrimp hanging yes and the fact that I can get it locally I'm happy with that fresh market then messed up cuz I don't figure some stuff out they gonna get tired of me mmm day long the time in China don't you think this is it won't be so bad again mm-hmm I cannot even um what you don't woman I meant to let you fall this is my concoction I hope you enjoy the recipe and they're never the recipe is fun just putting selfies the other so very easy I'm full come on I'm pleased I try not to eat too much broccoli cuz broccoli has the sneaky carbs in it mm-hmm no that's another thing that keto has taught me look at the facts of life even on vegetables because some vegetables are the biggest culprits of course now that's sneaky that is uh-huh knew I was killing it like somebody eat these vegetables I love lima beans often it's headies lima beans out and uh on taquitos like you oh whoa what lima beans you finna tell I'm not gonna be able to do it let me know if you guys have any questions or what else you want to seem wanna say this for my husband really good keto meal let me have so many seeds I know that's off-topic well I just need to get that off my chest let me know if

"the pizon offending italian cuisine since 2002 the pizon Pizza Huts answered to a product no one asks for it does have a nice ring to it though unlike the solo huh what does it even mean Pizza you should totally be making a biscotti or pisanio or a panini or a puberty for this recipe you're going to need dough whatever meat you want I'd suggest every animal you can find mozzarella parmesan marinara and a gallon of oil to begin we're going to roll out our dough into a big circle in order to do that we're going to start stretching out the dough like so getting your knuckles underneath and pull it away from the center and once it gets large enough just throw it in the air perfect circle now gently flour up your rolling pin so gently and you're going to want to roll this out much thinner than we have and then trace a perfect circle using our 12 inch cake pan aha they good round circle wax done Oh for the meat portion of this recipe I just grabbed whatever meat product that in my fridge you know because that's what men do it was better so I grilled up some sausage and ham and then I got this interesting pre-cooked bacon crumbles Oh kind of tastes like grape nuts which is a horrible cereal and kind of a funny name if you think about it's like I was in the hot tub too long and I got grape nuts alright back to our dough at this point we're just going to layer with cheese sausage ham grape-nuts and pepperoni notice others like no ricotta cheese huh pizza you're such a rebel now firmly press the dough together and then using the end of a wooden spoon we created these pinches to make it look like this now pour an unsafe amount of oil into the cake pan add your zone melt some garlic and butter and base this thing with layers of Parmesan cheese and dried parsley flakes and then toss this in the oven for 25 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit as a finishing touch brushed some more butter on and ghal some shredded Parmesan cheese some sauce for dipping and take a look at that that is authentic greasy Pizza Hut dough I believe Pizza Hut took the pizon off their menu again it's like a grievance period for all the victims families who died eating this pizza you're so sensitive alright guys please like comment subscribe we just need the Pizzo n-- resuming the front it's the business and I guess it's no longer on the menu anymore so I guess you have to get it home or you can take to Pizza Hut pieces and put them together like a sandwich I will take this one but you can't you can't actually eat it vote no because I'm on a no-carb diet she's on some weird cleanse so I can smell it I think what I'm probably gonna do guys is I'm going to recreate every single Pizza Hut thing on their menu I'm gonna do the breadsticks the pan pizza this stuffed crust pizza we're gonna do their salad comment below let me know what you want to see me make from Pizza Hut and we'll probably make it if it's from anywhere that we might not make it only my oh definitely tell us other stuff to you but right now we're on a Pizza Hut talk about kicking somethin talk about kicking Pizza Hut in the butt yeah isn't it better at home huh you're done alright guys Julia's my food holder person in the plate and I'm going to be taking one giganteus bite for the health of it oh my god me oh that's a good bite look at that you should get sumup on the Cameo look at this thing is hands down absolutely amazing thumbs up to the zone and remember it's not healthy if it's healthy not healthy then this is definitely healthy then oh no a DLL way mmm it's like the jello je h-e-l-l-o okay goodbye bye bye see you next time on healthy junk food", "4UfoOSGANXM": "yo guess what it is a happy quarantine Saturday and I'm making something special for you all I'm making my garlic parmesan crusted salmon I'm not gonna say Salman and I don't want y'all tryin to get me together in the comments I know that salmon the other is silent so y'all don't know that I just learned that I will stand it either way in both ways but who cares we am ready to throw down so what you will need what I have here is some kroger brand parmesan shredded cheese this is optional you can use whatever you would like for a marinade I ran across this this is also kroger brand by private selections this is one of their brands or what have you this is parmesan and roasted garlic dressing so I like to use this as a marinade so before I do any of that what I like to do with all my foods is squeeze and lemon in them on all these in Anzhi fish you know just kind of get it all over this is before I even go in with any type of seasoning or marinade or anything a little teasing so as you can see it's on there real good oh oh I'm sorry another ingredient that you guys are gonna need this is optional also although I will say I'm not sure why you wouldn't wouldn't want to Cheers happy Saturday y'all this is a little spike wine it's wine right which means it already has alcohol but when I say spiked you know I spiked my little uh tequila you know like a Moscato Rita that's deadly margarita let's go Narita so there's that you also want to have so let me not get ahead of myself so what you're gonna do is just take this same kind of lightly as you can you guys see you want to kind of lightly spread that on and then just take a utensil I use my handy dandy rainbow folk and I will spray that one like see you there we go oh that smells good it's got a little parmesan in it Paramecium you know sort of figure out who speak French that's not French death listen don't take my word I like to mess words up so then you want to go in I like obey on my seafood and on my fish so you want to go ahead and lightly put that on that's what I'd be doing this is what I've been doing you can use libraries I use a little arteries too and then you know you can get some pepper it can be regular pepper it doesn't have to be the ground pepper with the peppercorns or what have you but this isn't I like you can use Rhaego you can use regular pepper but this is what I prefer so that's what I'm using listen and y'all don't be trying to get me together by my nails either I know it's way past filling time but we have a video coming about that - I've actually ordered me a nail kit off of the Amazon so I can go ahead and tend to my own nails mhm thank you very much so in the meantime in between time you can also use some sea salt and this is also also optional but I think I prefer to live in summer o momento por favor be right back you can do if you want to you know you can season it like you season a good old chicken you know do some some onion powder some garlic powder so then there's that so we're gonna put this to the side not ordinarily you may want to marinate this overnight anybody got time for that I'm ready to eat so I'll put that to the side so this is where we get started with the breading okay so what I like to do is take a small amount of the kroger breading bread crumbs this is the traditional kind they also have the Italian kinda actually prefer that and I thought that's what I had but that ain't this ain't that so I'm just gonna use what I have who's going back to the store who wants to mask up just to go to the store when you can just use what you have you know use what you got to get what you want okay Oh another thing I like to use is fresh garlic and fresh rosemary I already have some cut up here you can see how small it's cut up I don't have any minced garlic you can that too that's also an option I prefer fresh it just tastes so much better but either way it'll be just fine and then fresh rosemary you see how small I cut that up and you know with both of these a little bit goes a long way so you know knock yourself out put that on in there too and I would say I mean you can pretty much eyeball it compared to what I did you know I didn't really do any measurements but at the same time I have been making this for quite some time so if you just have to have measurements or whatever I would say like maybe a you know a clove of garlic and then maybe a half of not even a half a quarter of a stick of this fresh rosemary this is what the rosemary looks like so I would just like use like maybe this much these mini and then I would chop a real skinny you know get out the razor blade like probably on Goodfellas if you want to but there's that so what you're gonna be looking for with this it's like a crumbly type of consistency oh by the way you might want to pre-heat your oven to 350 back okay so now you're gonna take some melted butter I think this is a probably a phone setting yet okay now where was I okay so I was telling you to put your butter inside of your mixture here I think I used about I want to say a half a stick you want to melt the butter first and then go ahead and mix it in your mixture and then what I also did was took a lemon and a squirrel's it on there now but you didn't get to see that part you're going to see that part cuz my camera hit cut off because I needed to delete some files so I suppose the lemon in there cuz I love lemon juice it gives it such you know a nice tangy flavor and then I took I would say maybe a quarter of a cup of Parmesan cheese and I put that in here as well and then the consistency you're looking for is kind of crumbly so you want to go ahead and pin it on them okay so I had to take it off of my fish you can had already petted it on there but that's okay this is we live to fight another day as you can see I'm putting it on not too thick not too thin you just want pity and pity get that on there real good and then this is really really quick and easy I mean you can see the prep time is like barely even 15 minutes well I kind of cut my stuff up so my stuff is already pre prepped so then you know I actually lied so like the prep time is like really sort of like maybe um I guess maybe about less than 20 minutes you know cuz you're not up oven is ready so you definitely want to heat that up and up to 385 don't leave your salmon and egg in there for any longer than 15 to 20 minutes you don't want it to be rubbish you don't want it to be dry either okay so just make sure you pity it did it so make sure you pity okay so then I'm like I don't know if you guys like these this is optional I like capers I actually just started like in capers like within the last couple of years and it gives it a little more tang and it makes the sauce really good too because it makes a tiny bit of sauce you know with the dressing that you decide to marinate it in so yeah there's that I'm gonna go ahead and pause this this video this video throw this in the oven and I will be back with the results ready for the finished product with while I my darlings look at that look how good that looks and I wish you guys had smell-o-vision cuz you're talking about the kitchen smells like heaven and guess what I made for y'all while we were waiting oh nasty wish salad yes with all the fixings and stuff so we have carrots cucumber red onions and I even fry some bacon it makes them bacon bits for you guys so bippity Boppity nothing to do with this bibbidi-bobbidi bacon so wait guys wait so now I'm getting ready to cut this open you just want to make sure you know you get it nice and golden brown on top and I think I want this big fat juicy piece right here look look at that little bit y'all a ready wait I'm trying to get my camera together can you see look at that and you want to make sure you don't get the bottom part some people eat the bottom part I don't perfect so drop down in the comments let me know what else you guys would like me to do a tutorial on definitely going to be sending some cake videos your way definitely I think another video I might want to do for you all would be my creamed spinach that's another good thing to pair with the salmon it's really good together and yeah I'm getting ready to throw down honey look at this you", "2pHohSom0Kk": "hey guys today we are making a very highly requested recipe one of my favorites we're making carrot cake cookies carrot cake is my favorite type of cake I always got it for my birthday it's a really straightforward recipe we're gonna start by microwaving 1/4 cup 4 tablespoons of butter so since your butter is hot a little trick I like to do is I add the erythritol to the butter before I add the eggs for the egg doesn't cook so we're gonna add 1/4 cup erythritol to your melted butter and give that a quick whisk and now we're gonna crack one egg into the butter we're also gonna add 1/4 teaspoon maple extract and I think this is the secret to getting a good carrot cake because normally carrot cake uses a light brown or a brown sugar but since we're not using brown sugar I think the mix of the erythritol and the maple extract really brings out that carrot cake flavor now we're gonna give that a whisk now to your wet mixture you're gonna add your dry ingredients we have 3/4 cup almond flour 1/4 cup coconut flour 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and then we're gonna do nuts and carrots I have chosen walnuts I think walnuts and pecans are usually what carrot cake traditionally has so you can go any not route though you can do almonds if you want whatever you have at home will work great in this cookie recipe so just add your dry ingredients to your wet mixture and then we're also gonna add 1/4 teaspoon pink salt we always add salt to everything and let's give that a mix and that's what your dough is gonna look like it is pretty firm and that's a nice firm cookie dough and now for the fun part we're gonna do the add-ins you can add the walnuts and whole but I like to crush them up I want walnut in all my bites and then we're also going to add in carrots this is optional some of you don't like to have carrots but I do so we have these shredded carrots in our fridge I'm going to use these you can buy whatever carrots you want and chop them up how big or small you long I'm just gonna get a nice handful and roughly chop these up that looks good it's probably like 1/4 to 1/3 cup you can also shred them up in a food processor that'll make it like nice and you know finer so you won't get like big chunks of carrot in your cookies we get a lot of people commenting on our knife skills we have none let that be known now we're just going to add the carrots and the walnuts to our cookie dough mixture and then you're just gonna fold all the ingredients in with your spatula now you're going to get a baking sheet you're gonna line it with some parchment paper and then I'm going to use a cookie scooper to scoop out some of the cookies and just place them in balls on the sheet okay so these will not spread in the oven at all that's usually because the coconut flour it's really absorbent so it doesn't spread so we're gonna Pat these out with our hand to the size we want all right once you get them padded out to the size of your liking you're gonna stick them in the oven at 350 degrees we are gonna check on them around 10:00 but anywhere from 12 to 15 minutes depending on your oven these will be good to go we'll be back when they are done all right so they were in the oven for 12 minutes and then they've been cooling for about five to ten so you definitely want to let these cool because they will fall apart instantly if you just try to pick one up so to finish this video off we're gonna have a Matt jump in and give these a taste test and give you a little tip about some frosting because I can't try these unfortunately they have almond flour coming in hot with frosting tips the deal with these cookies is they're really good but they're very lightly sweet and they're made to go with the cream cheese frosting that we have linked in the description below there's a full recipe post on that so check that out I would recommend making that with these if you want them to be like a really good sweet dessert if you just want to make these stand alone without the frosting add more sweetener to them I love cookies like this like maple walnuts fall flavors really good just enough carrots to get the good care of taste but you're not going to overdo it with the carbs coming from the carrots and they also add like a nice little bit of sweetness to definitely give this recipe a try this is a really good one make it with the frosting give it to your children's let them lick the bowl let me know what you think I comment below [Music]", "x9FEYXIm1v0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey my keto friends welcome back to my channel ketu asami for today's video we have an awesome easy yummy recipe not too long ago i had posted one of my dinners and all y'all commented saying can i please make a video on the recipe so here it is today we're going to making some keto lasagna stuffed chicken it's full of cheese full of flavor and so easy to make so you all are going to love it let's get straight into this video these are all going to be our ingredients for our lasagna stuffed chicken of course you are going to want three large chicken breasts you're going to want a low carb marinara sauce this has just happened to me my favorite brand it's a no sugar added i did get this from hgb you're going to want some whole milk ricotta cheese and one large egg for the ricotta one and a half cups of shredded mozzarella cheese and just for our seasonings we have some salt some pepper italian seasoning garlic powder and some parsley flakes and these are all ingredients that we're going to be using today first step you want to do is get your chicken breast and we are going to slit this but we're going to stuff it so you don't want to slit it all the way you just want to make a flap so take a knife find a good slitting part i usually do it in the front and i kind of leave the thickness to the back and i'm just going to slit it in half just not all the way through we're going to making a pocket right before you reach the end you just want to lay it flat just like this and repeat until you're done okay once you get all your chicken breasts slit you don't want it thick like this you don't want it to unevenly cook so what you're going to do is pound them into an even thickness you're going to take one of your chicken breasts and to prevent tearing i'm just going to put some plastic wrap right over it i have a piece of plastic wrap then you're just going to get something heavy and pound it until you have an even thickness but be careful try not to tear it and once you have it even thickness all around just like this you're going to repeat to your other chicken breast once you have all your chicken breasts to even thickness you're going to take some olive oil and pour it onto your chicken breast and are going to season you're going to season the front and the back with some pepper some garlic powder italian seasoning and some salt go ahead and flip your chicken breast over and repeat with the same seasonings and olive oil if you do not have olive oil you can also use some avocado oil all right and once you have your chicken breast seasoned go ahead and set this to the side and bring out your ricotta now you want to take a large enough bowl for your ricotta to fit in i have one container of ricotta cheese it is the 15 ounce container and i'm gonna dump it into my bowl go ahead and smush it down break it apart we are going to add one large egg for binding our ricotta and then you do want to season your ricotta you don't want it plain because it won't really have a taste to it so we are going to season with a teaspoon of black pepper a teaspoon of salt some italian seasoning a teaspoon of parsley flakes then you are only going to add half a cup of your mozzarella cheese the rest is for the other topping so we're going to add half a cup and you're going to mix this well until your egg is mixed into your ricotta and all your seasonings and cheese it should come out nice and creamy okay once your egg is nice and mixed into your ricotta just set this aside because we're going to be stuffing our chicken with it it should look something like this go ahead and bring back over your chicken breast now this part i like to use toothpicks just to secure my chicken breast so the ricotta doesn't flow out you don't have to if you like tightly close it but it really does help if you do have toothpicks so you're going to want to face the chicken breast up with the opening and we are going to spoon in our ricotta cheese mixture right into the middle i try not to go to the edges i kind of just keep it in the middle so it closes tightly and we don't have it overflowing this mixture will make about three to four chicken breasts okay once you have your chicken breast stuffed you are going to gently fold it over until it's closed try to keep all the ricotta mixture in there if you need to you can just spoon it back push it back so we can tightly close it with our toothpicks just like this now go ahead and take some two pieces and secure it push them all the way through just like that now repeat until you're done if you do have a little tear in your chicken breast some of them will tear a little bit it's totally fine the ricotta will still stay in there it will not all come out all right and once you have closed all your chicken breasts before we pop these in the oven i like to get a nice sear on them so let's move on over to the stove now all we're going to do is get a sear on each side of the chicken breast it's not going to be cooked all the way through just yet pan on a medium heat drop in a tablespoon of some olive oil and let it heat through we're going to drop in our chicken breasts make sure you do have a baking dish set off to the side because when they're done we're going to put them straight into our baking dish go ahead and get a nice sear on each side for about five minutes you should have a nice sear on each side of the chicken breast just like this now go ahead and transfer them to your baking dish and you can also take off the toothpicks now you're going to want to take your low carb bread sauce and just pour it over your chicken breast and spread it out evenly make sure it's nice and covered i'm using half a cup depending on how big your chicken breasts are you can add a little bit more if you need to cover it once your chicken breasts are nice and coated into your red sauce it's time to pop this in the oven you're going to want to preheat your oven to 375 degrees go ahead and pop that delicious chicken into your oven it for approximately 25 to 30 minutes depending on how thick your chicken is you just want it cooked all the way through once it's out the oven after your 25 to 30 minutes it should look something like this your chicken breast should be cooked through don't turn off your oven yet we want to do one last step you are going to sprinkle on the remainder cup of shredded mozzarella cheese right on top once you have done that you are going to pop this back into your oven for about five more minutes until your cheese is melted and once your cheese is done melting your chicken should look like this all the way cooked through now the only thing we're gonna do is just top it with some parsley flakes it just adds color and makes it look all nice and pretty and your lasagna stuffed chicken is done very simple full of flavor literally probably the easiest stuffed chicken that you will ever make it's absolutely delicious everybody will enjoy this recipe so i hope you all love it and give it a try now of course we have to cut into this delicious chicken look at that all that cheese we got our red sauce and when we cut into it we're

Today we are going to make spinach noodles with the garlic sauce. Let's talk about spinach first. Spinach contains iron and calcium, and a bunch of other vitamins However it also contains a lot of oxalic acid. It is different from the folic acid which pregnant women eat. Oxalic acid can combine with iron and calcium in the body, affecting their absorption. However, after hot water treatment, it will reduce the content of oxalic acid. So I usually choose the boiled method to handle the spinach. boil the spinach for one to two minutes take out and let cool After letting cool, let\u2019s take a look at the spinach stem. With your fingers pinched, you see that the spinach stem is already soft. Add flour directly at this time, no need to add water. add salt. Then get started to knead the dough you need to adjust the amount of flour and knead it into a medium-hard dough. rest the dough for 20 minutes The dough becomes softer. It\u2019s very easy to knead it to smooth rest the dough for 2 hours. Let the gluten completely relax. Now let's prepare the seasoning: chopped green onion Garlic chili powder salt a little bit of sugar Pour some oil into the pan, we fry some green onions Then splashed on top of the chili powder Chinkiang vinegar soy sauce water Finally, a little bit of sesame oil the main flavor for this sauce is  the garlic and vinegar. Two hours later, the dough is ready, we will roll the dough Sprinkle some flour Use a rolling pin to push the dough from the middle when it is flat,  roll up Push forward while pressing down And push the dough from the center to the sides Then change direction and do it again. until reach the thickness you prefer, and it doesn't have to be very thin Sprinkle with corn flour to prevent them from sticking Roll the dough on the rolling pin Cut with a knife Then cut into large pieces usually the noodles won't stick to each other because of the corn flour If they do, tear them open by hand. when water is boiling add the noodles, do not cook too much at a time it is easy to cook, just a minute or two. Remove it and put it in the ice water, it will become smooth in seconds take some garlic sauce, and fish it out directly from the ice water. after soaking in the ice water, the noodles become very smooth and al dente With sour and spicy sauce, it is especially appetizing in summer. This is Gao, thank you for watching. We will see you next time.", "YVPQC-eMrFk": "[Music] do okay you guys we just came back from sprouts and i have a couple of things in my mind that i'm thinking about making and i hope it doesn't turn into an epic fail because i i wanna make well we're showing it either way okay i wanna make funnel cakes keto funnel cakes you guys so keto cake funnel cakes from the fair that you used to get well i bought avocado oil because they're fried i think i'm gonna make a keto chao protein based truffle to make it with and i bought some new for chatel i don't know how to pronounce this you guys nufa chatel chatel uh cheese to use is the cream cheese cheese base and i'm gonna make a raspberry compote to go on top of it because the funnel cakes that harry and i grew up with were from knott's berry farm and a long time ago nuts very far made them and used real boysenberry compote oh yeah and sprinkled powdered sugar on the top of them and we were right across from the log right that was the only funnel uh cake booth and the line was like around the building it was so big but i want to do that uh raspberries are one of the few um berries that you can have you can have strawberries blackberries raspberries and blueberries in moderation so i'm gonna do that you guys in my mind i'm thinking what i need to do it may be an epic fail it may be may not work but in my mind i think i know what i'm going to do so i'll bring you guys back but we went to sprouts so i got organic raspberries i got the new fatshell fat new for chateau anyway it's one third less fat than regular cream cheese and there's one less carb too i got the super creamer i see everybody using it and this one does not have almond milk in it and i've been having issues you guys remember i quit doing almond milk because it was killing my hands my hands are doing great so i want to try this one this one's the vanilla the reason why i decided to do this is you guys because i drink heavy whipping cream there isn't any this was the largest and there was only one this is the only one on the planet so it's crazy harry i know they had all the sizes of half and half and this lone little heavy whipping cream sitting on the shelf all by itself so that's what i got that's what i got now in my mind i also have a recipe that i want to do with the uh tomato cream tomato basil savory soup base from ketochow and i wanted to have sausage in it and i wanted to have mozzarella cheese in it i need to get mozzarella cheese um so i'm thinking about that sometime this week but this is really good really clean ingredients true story is awesome and i don't know harry did we get the ingredients or not i can't remember i was torn between this and applegate they're both really good brands but i just think i'm going to try this brand and see now i also you guys are posting stuff on the loving knit on keto with wendy found facebook group and the pictures look yummy and if you guys are new and you haven't joined yet please join our facebook group because i'm telling you the food that people are posting is absolutely amazing delicious and keto uh i've been seeing i saw pizza truffles that looked amazing so i got some rouse homemade pizza sauce and this is the these are the ingredients can you get see them down here okay you guys the ingredients for the rows homemade pizza sauce is italian whole peeled tomatoes italian cherry tomatoes olive oil carrots onions salt oregano garlic and basil that's it super simple super easy you get a whole quarter of a cup for 40 calories and three total carbohydrates so these are what i'm gonna make during the week you guys so you guys are kind of seeing my meal prepping items that i'm gonna need and look you guys we got the only two ginger root beer and we got a black cherry zvm you got to grab it when they have it i'm telling you stuff's not on the shelves like it used to be so anyway you guys this is my little haul and i'm really excited because i'm going to make those um funnel cakes but you guys harry's got to fix the camera because there he's having issues with the the focus i'll let him do that we'll come back on the next segment we'll share the big board with everybody okay everybody this is an experiment i hope that it works i am making keto funnel cakes wendy's way and i'm topping them with a warm raspberry compote so i have two ounces of strawberries i mean if raspberries two ounces weighted raspberries and i'm just going to smash them up just a little bit smash these babies up you can use your berry of choice as long as it's keto strawberry raspberry blueberry they don't have boysenberries here but you guys may be able to if you guys live in a state that has them what about the uh sugar content to this stuff it doesn't the keto berries these are potato berries huh yes they're they're they're born without sugar they are the lee strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries are the lowest in sugar and they are keto but you have to weigh and measure them and you have to fit them into your macros got it so i am using two ounces and quit asking questions or my brain isn't going to work here you just have to just be quiet unless you hear me say pounds and it's supposed to be ounces so i'm taking smashed two ounces smashed fresh raspberries i'm putting them in a pan and this pan is actually too big i want a little pan i have a littler one because you're not making that much because you're not pouring this on this is just a drizzle of raspberry compote okay so taking my raspberry putting it in putting it in and i i make everything simple you guys i make it really simple so here's the deal smash it up get that raspberry taste now i have strawberry syrup from walden's farms it's already made already done so i am making i'm taking a third of a cup taking the strawberry walden farms you can order it on amazon you can get it in the stores it is made with sucralose putting that in the container now let me stir this up i'm a taster this is for harry and i so i lick things and taste things and do things ooh that's going to look really good okay now i'm going to turn this oven on get it heated it smells like candy huh other than that it smells good yeah i may or may not put a little bit of lemon in this sometimes you need that extra kick let me get a little spoon well what's it need which is pretty damn good does it i just want i like the tart and tanginess so i'm just gonna take this homemade not homemade homegrown lemon and i'm just gonna literally put a couple drops barely squeeze 10 11 11 drops just to give some sis get that citrusy taste to it on the taste yep butter taste now it has it it'll it'll be more flavorful wow not good that tastes a lot better than i thought it would okay so i want to let that be going now looking at recipes you need hot oil i'm using avocado oil because you can heat it to 500 degrees turning my oven on and you're supposed to put an inch of oil in here that's a lot of oil but we are frying the funnel cake we're frying it in olive oil no an avocado oil avocado oil big difference big difference okay so i'm gonna get that hot interestingly enough if you have a wooden handle or a wooden spoon you heat your avocado oil you put your spoon in it when it gets bubbles around the wood that's hot enough yes really yes that's an old old cook trick before they had all this newfangled appliances like uh you know auto temperature gauges and all the good things in life okay so this is going look see i'm gonna cook it down i just want to cook it down cook it down turn it down to medium so you wait for it to steam then turn it down to medium no i waited for it to boil and get hot see it's bubbling i want the natural sugars to thicken up and reduce down a little bit that's what i want and if you guys have one of those newfangled little things that you can de-seed and you don't like raspberry seeds you can de-seed it and put it in it's just basically getting a taste i want that taste yep i put that on low like about two and just let that heat okay here's the deal i have two ounces and this is going to go fast harry don't ask questions because my brain has to make the recipe i've got two ounces of this i don't interrupt ever yeah i have two ounces of this cheese you can use cream cheese or this this is a little less tart a little bit more smooth because you want the batter to be really smooth i've got three eggs in here okay i am gonna add half of a teaspoon vanilla extract i am adding in a quarter of a cup of heavy cream i'm going to put in half a cup of water right now and i'm just going to put it in here because i want to get that cream out of my cup right so this is a quarter of a cup and then another quarter of a cup that equals a half a cup right now okay whip it now in here i have a pinch of salt redmond salt i have a three quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder i have a tablespoon of squirt of swerve confectioner's sugar in here a tablespoon okay so i'm gonna get that all in here i'm gonna make sure we've got it all i'm gonna mix that give it a good swirl here now excuse your head let me check on this real quick that's good get the cheese out and into the batter into here i want to mix it really good sorry you guys i don't have a good counter to share this on everything with but i just don't watch out harry that's very hot okay now paper bird flying through the room here's the deal i'm using keto chow yes i am because i don't have flour i don't have regular flour i'm not using almond flour because i don't do well with almonds so i'm using ketochow vanilla and i'm using one packet or if you don't have the packet you have the big container one scoop putting it in i want them to use keto chow this is the recipe sorry folks i don't know in my head what the difference would be between the two all i know is this in my head works so we'll see now gotta use the immersion blender so i'm one okay one's low yep okay that's what i want take that off harry i'm going to give you this put it away now taste test it oh wow oh my god vanilla cake really they can just spoon with the batter on a cake oh yeah yes indeed now anyone has that uh excuse me i gotta get this prettiness of what harry can make make cakes you know i'm gonna put this in here see oh look at that that means the oil is hot enough i know pretty cool huh yeah okay now i know why you like now i know why you got some wooden things i was always wondering all this out of the way because this is going to be oh please dear god let it work okay you guys got my scoop here we go here we go you want to pour it in in little circles we're dipping everywhere [Music] i think it's gonna burn move out of the way i have the fire way too hot way too hot okay smells good it may not work i think i got the fire way too hot first batch [Music] yeah it's way too hot i think so yeah smell it smells like burnt pancakes i don't smell anything yet let's try this again shall we it may be the batter doesn't work that didn't work the batter may not work let me see the batter may not work because you need flour to hold it together may not work you guys just may not work i really wanted it to work [Music] that's i don't know if it's the keto chow or what we'll see we'll see might be lots of things might be the cheese i may not i may not have to put any cheese in here i don't know it's all bubbling up like crazy i'm going to make some looks good though it does kind of bubbling yeah it doesn't look good though they're going that rough i'm going to have to figure it out am i i think it's the cheese maybe keto chao without the cheese in it smells good doesn't need herring and it did taste like cake batter yeah there we go what do you got the setting on from low it's a problem with electric you have to yeah but i wouldn't notify i'd be afraid to just run a flame water and oil don't mix you need a bag of sand on the sideline is that what you're saying yeah and i wouldn't try doing this unless you knew how to fry you know actually it smells good because of all the uh i think what it is is this has too much cheese in it okay let me try this try this well now it's not hot enough flame on it might be the keto towel you taste this i don't know oh that kind of roast yeah it goes to the inside coming up as it's getting hotter that's really good flavor there's like three a charm then you take a little bit of swerve sprinkle it and get some of this andros light with a little raspberry like you said harry can't be perfect all the time that's right it's impossible i'll try this that's pretty dang good i gotta perfect the the batter something wrong with the batter it's making i think it's the cheese try this it's good looks terrible yeah i know but man it's really good though all right okay i'm on fire actually that's very good it is it's really but it's just looks funky it's not it's not more than it looks like funnel cake it's softer than funnel cake and i think it needs no cheese i think i need to make it without the cheese and make another batch and try it okay i have the oil you know well you can use that wow i don't know i do like it see these pieces look like funnel cake these little guys that looks like funnel cake fried funnel cake goodness this is gonna be more eggy maybe i have too many eggs i'll figure it out telling you because that's good which very good oh my god it's really good this one is more burnt yeah but let's how many have it taste it though it's good you have a bite tastes better yeah it tastes burnt so what i mean have another piece why isn't this one going yeah it's got a burnt taste to it this is not hot enough look it's too cheesy too too eggy too cheesy so what i'm going to do i'm going to make another batch because it's worth experimenting on it's worth figuring out i'm going to come back and i'm going to make a different batch of this for everyone because i think i think if i don't put any i'll come right back you guys round two let's check it out these make little puffs so i made another batch these i think have too much baking powder in them and i took i'm not using the cheese in them at all let's put them aside now this is round two you got the stuff hot enough and all that stuff i hope so let me taste this let's see what this does this has no cream no cheese in it and it has one egg let's see what we can do nope it's got to be thinner got to put a little bit more water in it too thick too thick so how much water you got in it so far i'm gonna put an eighth of a cup i have a half a cup in it says to drizzle it you gotta have well there's got to be something runny it has to be somewhat rough yummy so three quarters of a cup do that's more funnel cakey looking i used one egg three quarters cup of water half a teaspoon of baking soda or baking powder a tablespoon of swerve a package of eggnog ketochow and it is doing better you just want to puff like little balloons and let's taste this one harry please look at these little balloony puffy guys right because they look pretty that's pretty good actually so let me these are the first batch first try this is the one that had the cheese and the um three eggs in it sprinkle a little bit these have a more donut-y taste to them okay let me taste see mmm those are good have one oops pull that off for me i got mmm that's my favorite fruit mm-hmm yeah i smell like fear more funnel cakey not bad mine okay danger danger will robinson yeah the fat movie absolutely now that's good that's really good um let's put a little raspberry on that [Music] these need to go up just a little bit they want to puff up like a little pancake like a little balloon which is fine they taste good they just don't funnel they don't funnel you know i don't know what that means well the fun they don't stick together and i think that's because there's no flour but they really have a good taste yeah they're great that raspberry compote is delicious here harry funnel cakes wendy's way these are really good these ones are aren't they oh yeah even though they want to puff like a balloon mm-hmm chase top oh yeah that's the ticket you just have to be patient i'm gonna try one now those are like really good yeah here's some with raspberry i got some it tastes like doughnuts yeah yeah i taste doughnutty kinda you think five pounds tomorrow i don't know i'm telling you that's good those aren't good all day long i have the big oops look what i did is that one yours harry is that what you're saying no you can have it if you want it no you cooked it if you're not gonna eat it it's mine these are dangerous those are i know they are you guys they may not look like funnel cakes as far as sticking together but oh my gosh they are addicting because i got them everywhere okay i need another i have to stop or i'll eat the whole plate this one's the eggnog you mean eggnog well i made it with one egg oh okay no cheese right i made it with a quarter of a cup of heavy cream i made it with that sucker look at that bad boy right there it's like a donut look at that big thing i know it's like a donut what you made at all the play's almost empty how'd that happen okay here we go see if i can do it problem is it's getting it thin enough i may have to put it like in a little thing where you just you know what would work really good doing that what that oil separator we have not oh to pour it because it holds in the bottom and you just kind of fill it up push this push the little trigger and let it come out the bottom now this is looks more like a funnel cake this one's the eggnog with a quarter of a cup of cream the um half a teaspoon of vanilla extract a tablespoon of swerve half of a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt yeah that looks good now where's my little spoon i wonder how many people are not familiar with funnel cakes well they can google it because if you've never been to a fair you probably don't know what a bottle cake is it's basically fried dough sprinkled in powdered sugar and served hot like these are or they have a compote of some kind of fruit warm fruit compote on them again just a little bit a raspberry goes a long ways on these then they taste like raspberry filled donuts yes they do they do i'm telling you now this one harry you ate all yours no i did it the dog did that you forgot those i have to have those little guys to have those this is the biggest mass but it's so good gotta eat them hot look at this it's like a little pillow donut eggnog does it taste like eggnog i have those that's really good which ones well you get the little ones because you ate all the other ones yes eggnoggy oh huh ma'am and they used to put it on a paper plate and you just have to eat it with your fingers which one do you like better well i couldn't tell you yeah why because i'm inhaling it yeah i get i'll take this one right here i'll take don't take this little one right here okay seriously i like them both but i think i like the vanilla this over here better use the vanilla one but again i got a really good bite of something that must be the eggnog stuff well i'll tell you what i got powder everywhere that's good i wouldn't say no to any of these no i'll have to write this up oh yeah because there's a trick to it and i think it does not need any cheese that's one of the tricks but look at my front i think i'm wearing it not that bad excuse me honey it's not gonna work mine it's too hot so the trick is to get your temperature of the oil correct number one number two don't get it all over you wear your apron yeah like the hair yeah i like the apple in your box thank you i should have had it on because now i'm covered with swerve powdered swerve but oh my gosh you guys these are good i just got to get the consistency right you know there's some of you guys that are really good chefs okay so i'm going to start naming some people shelly karen come on you guys help a girl out here yeah really man let's see if this kind of make this a uh open source kind of thing going on because let me tell you the vanilla one all day long has fabulous flavor i don't have any more keto vanilla well really now i'm going to have to get some people don't need to eat anymore these are just like donuts oh my god i'm going to see if i can flip it like a real funnel cake he's ready i don't know yeah you know maybe karen or shelly's got a foot i know look at that there that's better that's better there we i think you don't need the cheese in it i don't think you need um you gotta get the oil just right and you don't need as much um baking baking powder the first one had three quarters of a teaspoon this one has a quarter of a teaspoon because i am using keto chop this one looks like it's going to be the best so this one would be a quarter of a cup of cream one egg three quarters a cup of water half a teaspoon of vanilla extract a tablespoon of swerve confectioner's sugar pinch of salt that looks good doesn't it oh yeah that's the one [Music] that looks really good i gotta write this down because seriously that is a keeper it really is it's just difficult you gotta you gotta just really pour it in slow you gotta get the batter the right consistency so it pours because otherwise it looks like doughnuts which they're good but you gotta let them cook longer and um it's really good move move puppy baby she's like right under her foot because she says i want someone the funnel cake that's what i like i like to know they came up with the name funnel well they may have poured it from a funnel originally you know like a batter funnel and squeezed it in and made it look all pretty yeah decorated yeah swirled it around right and that probably would work really well with this but i didn't have any funnel paper or plastic i could have used a baggie and squeezed it but once you start squeezing you got to use it all [Music] it's just softer than a funnel cake batter because there's no flour excuse me it's really interesting you know how they make fun of cakes and then just crisscross over the funnel and i just make sure you have no babies or puppies around them yeah and stuff and don't have don't use water around it because it's oil have an inch of oil here throw water in that you're going to have a freaking explosion i mean you don't even want your utensils to have water on them yup because you are cooking with a lot of oil now i'm going to put a little cinnamon on this one a little cinnamon a little sugar a little swerve a little bit of cinnamon you know wendy's way yeah teaspoon compote on it it's funny it doesn't take a lot of raspberry at all you ever notice that yeah bring that flavor over oh this one's doing over here okay taste this one harry that's hot well don't burn yourself well try not to it's puffy like a donut it's very good isn't it it's good how's that uh going to the fair kind of taste to it it does i like it better without the cinnamon i think because it's moist real funnel cake taste yeah this is dinner man look at it five pounds we'll know why you can't stop eating it that's the problem that's good [Music] here if you had one of those really big fat spatulas oh yeah that'd be good they make them i may go get one because i'm telling you this is worth it if you're craving donuts if you're craving fair food all day long oh my gosh well i don't want to set anybody off with this no but they're very filling really watch harry wendy gained 25 pounds right before your eyes it sounds like it would huh mine i dip it in that powdered sugar yeah the first one you guys i burnt because the the oil was too hot the first batter puff puffed up too much and i think it was softer it was the cheese so i really think this last batch is the best excuse me it reminds me being a little kid like a little kid eating that crud stuff this isn't crud it's good so i really like the vanilla the best yeah yeah that's really good me too that one that i had over here yeah with the vanilla yeah this was that was good that was good so what did you use in that one vanilla just that's all you change is just the one item i took out the cream cheese because it's too wet it was too thick and too dense and i used less eggs okay yeah you're gonna have to write this down because it's very complicated because we did so many different things yes what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make it from scratch the way i think i did it the last very last time and do it in a plain environment before i give you the thumbs up on what the recipe is but i'm sure it's one egg quarter of a cup of heavy whipping cream or your milk substitute you're going to need more or less water depending on your milk substitute because you want it thick i used a pinch of salt quarter of a teaspoon of baking powder a tablespoon of swerve confectioners sugar and i used a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and if you're missing donuts homemade fried donuts this is for you telling you just remember if you're making if you make this yes i sure record everything else you ate that day so you'll know very sorry if this is what makes you go up or the other food you eat makes you look because we aren't going to know nothing until tomorrow morning well what i should have done in hindsight what i should have done is measured my oil first cooled it all the way off and then re-measured it to see how much oil soaked in to the actual batter and if you eat this the day you eat it don't use oil on anything else yeah and don't eat all the batches like carrie and i are well we gotta try them out totally that good it is good it is good if you have your vanilla ketochow that is absolutely the one i would use oh my god every day of the week i'm gonna have to do something to try to control this okay if i was to eat dinner too oh my goodness excuse me you guys funnel cake keto style it doesn't look pretty but let me tell you it's pretty dang tasty it really is but i've got to perfect this first you guys get to look at it you get to see it and if you're brave maybe you can recreate it but don't use cheese in it don't use as many eggs i used one egg to one packet of keto chow quarter of a cup of cream i think a whole cup or half or three quarters of a cup of water

enjoy that you stop by in check out this channel join me today as we make our garlic parmesan keto friendly flatbread so easy and I think you're really gonna love it stay tuned okay so our keto garlic parmesan flatbread does require almond flour mozzarella cheese two tablespoons of cream cheese some baking powder and one egg and some butter and garlic and a few other ingredients that we'll go over in a little bit but because it has one egg I always test my eggs because and you should too if you use a bad egg you could get very sick and so it's so simple and so easy to check your eggs that it just takes a minute it less than a minute and that way you know your egg is good it's not bad so here we go okay so I'm gonna show you I've got my egg here it's very simple I just got myself a big cup and I turn on the water and pour some water into the cup now you don't have to fill it always how I get it pretty close and what you do is test your eggs it's this simple you drop your egg into the cup with the water and if you can see how it is it's laying in the bottom see it that means the egg is fine if it floated to the top which it would do right away that would mean the egg is bad you need to throw it away don't eat a bad egg so if it lays on the bottom you know it's good and then I rinse it off under some hot water okay there's some put on there you know I always rinse it off just to make sure there's nothing that I don't want on that eggshell in case it does get into the mixture so I don't have to worry about tucking it out but that's it now we know this egg is good so we're ready to go I'll just drop it on a paper towel and wipe it off a little bit until we're ready to use it I do that with all of my eggs I never eat an egg without testing at first so it's gonna be pretty simple and you'll see I've gathered all the ingredients together and I'll tell you what they are as we go through here but what you'll need is one large bowl one cup mozzarella cheese shredded just pour that in the bowl easy remember we wash that one egg that's gonna be for later so we're gonna set that aside for right now so we got the chick mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup of almond flour that goes into the boil we also have here on this plate 2 tablespoons of cream cheese now keep in mind there's no need to soft in it because it's going in the microwave oven so you got mozzarella cheese mixed in with the almond flour and the 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese so that's how we start so we're going to add one level teaspoon bake powder all right so that's all there is to that in the very beginning very very simple and we're gonna put that in the microwave for one minute to begin with if the cheese has not melted well we're gonna put it in there for about another 30 seconds at each time so 30 seconds 30 seconds but what you're looking for is you want the cream cheese to be melted and the mozzarella cheese to be melted so when that happens we're gonna take it out and we're gonna have to stir it vigorously and that's what we're gonna add the egg all right into the microwave it goes so the cheese is melted enough and we're going to we're gonna add in to that mixture 1 tablespoon of garlic powder and stir what you want is you want that to all get mixed in with the cheese just stir it and stir it until it gathers into a it's gonna gather into a ball and this is where you need a little elbow grease but not too much got that pretty much right into a ball and we're gonna crack our one egg in there that we've already tested to make sure that that egg is clean and that it's good get that well mixed into the batter it's gonna be a little soupy in the beginning but you'll see it does get thicker as you stir it in there so okay keep mixing my oven is set for 400 degrees ok so once it gathers back into a ball again we're just about ready to roll this out see how it kind of gathers into a ball so now that we've got the mixture in the bowl and it's all ready to go we're gonna get a couple pieces of parchment paper know I love this brand if you ever saw this at your store instead of having it on the roll I like it in this little box because you just pull the sheets out and they lay flat just a little tip but the the roll you know you have a hard time you got to put you know stuff on the edges to try to keep it down and this way it just comes out of the box this way and it lays nice and flat so that helps a lot when you're gonna roll out know one thing I will say this can get sticky so I'm gonna take a little bit of that butter we don't need all of it I just poured a drop or two on the parchment paper and I'm just gonna move that around on the parchment paper with my finger so that when we go to roll the bread out it doesn't stick you just take that extra butter and roll it right on your hands because that will help you have that keep from sticking to you as well now what you want to do you can roll it use a rolling pin or you can just flatten this out really with the fingers either way I mean it's just a personal choice so I'm gonna try putting a little butter on top not all of it what I want to keep the butter for the top when it gets rolled out and then we can put this on top and try to find your rolling pin who knows how long it was since your last Tuesday oh my gosh that's so funny I don't know about you all but I don't use a rolling pin too often so sometimes I have to look while for it and we're gonna just roll that out and the thickness is gonna be dependent on your specific taste but I would go leave it a little bit you know think so is it the first time you make it you kind of get an idea of how it can be without rolling it to Ken and then if you want crackers or chips or something like that where it's a little bit more crisp you can roll it out more next time but for the first time you might want to try it where it's not too too too there it doesn't have to be a straight rectangle in fact I kind of like it but it's not now one of the nice things is you have your pan you don't have to grease it so what you do is you take the pan get it ready and then you just take the flatbread that's between the dough that's between the sheets of parchment and you just take that top piece off and really it can bake right here just like this in the pan you don't have to take that off of there and try to figure out how you're gonna get that back in the pan so it will bake just like this now here's where the garlic and the parmesan comes in we're gonna put on top two tablespoons of butter just pour it on that butter on the bread and I don't know if you can see it very well but you just take a spoon and just move it across the top just get some butter in every little nook and cranny I mean I don't know about you but I'm starting to get hungry for this already because I know what it tastes like it's very good all right and for simplicity you can cut up a garlic clove or two and put that on top but I just use this jar kind and I take a spoonful maybe a spoon and a half and I just put that over the top if you like more garlic I have more garlic if you like less have a little less if you don't like garlic just have parmesan I just spread that out until I think that garlic is perfect and then I just take a simple grated Parmesan cheese so I'm just gonna sprinkle parmesan on top I give it a good amount I mean it's up to you any little balls like that I just kind of crush them down with my finger okay so that's ready it's gonna go into the oven and we're gonna bake that at 400 degrees 12 to 15 minutes start there start at 12 minutes and then check on it because it might not take that long at all so it depends on how you like it if you like it really well-done or if you don't like it so well done so we'll look at that in just a moment but into the oven 400 degrees so we've got our garlic parmesan flatbread in the oven now 400 degrees about 15 minutes again I would start checking about 12 minutes just to take a peek and see how it's doing and you may want to take a spatula and just lift up the bottom see how it is but that's about it now we wait okay so let's take a peek and remember we're just gonna take a look now you see it's getting a little bit brown on the edges that to me is just about perfect I might leave that maybe one more or two more minutes that's it I don't like mine to be too dark too crispy so you could flip it over with a big spatula or you can just leave it like that it just depends on what you like I'm gonna leave it a couple more minutes I hope that you really try this delicious flatbread because it may become one of your favorites okay I think we're ready to pull it out of the oven so I'm just gonna set this on a trip we know that this is awfully hot so keep your hot mint really close by I don't want you to get burned on my behalf so now we're just gonna take this and lift it off a little bit and it comes right up off to the parchment to be on now you can see the back of the bread is pretty well browned if I wanted to I could flip it over and leave it in there for a few more minutes but I like mine just like this let's let it cool for just a little bit we've I've just taken a paring knife and made scores right down there right down the sheets to the thickness that I wanted my flatbread so now if you want to make them in diagonals you may want to make them in long strips or shorter strips whatever your desire and because I need to have a taste right now I'm gonna take off a piece and have a little bite mm-hmm that is really delicious guys it's got a good amount of garlic not too much it's not overpowering hmm really delicious and you can use these flat breads to go with your eggs in the morning you can have them for a snack at night yeah them with a salad sometimes I cut them into small little bits and use them as croutons in a soup they're just so versatile sorry I don't mean to eat on I'm on camera but once you

add in some hot water mix and then let sit for 10 minutes or until foamy now add in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and slowly add in 4 cups of flour while mixing for 4 to 5 minutes now we're only

grease up a 9 by 13 inch pan with 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil this amount of oil is necessary to give you that Pizza Hut heart-stopping quality little fun fact in 2017 pizza plans to partner with colonoscopy clinics which is actually something I just made up now give it a little spray for good luck and cover this for an hour and a half until it doubles in size flatten it out by firmly pressing down on the dough until it fills the pan then partially cut into these so when it bakes you can just like tear it apart afterwards yeah then we baked it at 500 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes or until the bottoms are all golden brown now for the highly addicting cheesy salt crack that Pizza it spreads on top is a delicious combination of two tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and two teaspoons

pesto cream pepper sauce it's gonna be really good and it's all gonna be keto friendly so check it out we're gonna grill it let's go hey viewers thanks for watching and welcome back wanted to make a cream sauce to go over the Italian meatballs that I will make here coming up and I looked around and found a recipe that inspired me talk about that in a second but basically what i'm doing here is two tablespoons of butter and this is gonna be heavy cream and it's a cup of it [Music] I'm gonna bring that to a simmer eventually here total cook time about 15 between 15 and 20 minutes and then we'll thin it out with some water peppers coming up right here maybe quarter teaspoon ground black pepper the original recipe from just the good bits Channel and I'll leave a link to it Bob and Jim the original recipe he used red so obviously you can use whatever you like but I was looking for a key code savory sauce to go on my my Italian meatballs and I ran across Bob and Jan at just the good bits channel onion here on YouTube and I made it my own from their inspiration so its class classic green pesto here I want a savory somewhat he salty and creamy sauce to go underneath balls [Music] gonna mix it in and this is uh obviously I love garlic if you've been watching any of my stuff but here's that garlic paste a lot of people make their own garlic face and you can do it because this garlic paste isn't exactly cheap it's very convenient and that's what you're paying for is it convenience so you can make your own you can crush your own garlic slice it thinly and then make it into a paste but the budget allowed me to buy this this time and you can use any kind of cheese you want I chose parmesan and I did not have time to buy fresh grated parmesan which I would have preferred so this will do and then my own seasoned salt you can use regular salt but this is probably [Music] between a quarter to a half a teaspoon and I did add more later but here it is the sauce that will go on the meatballs and maybe you should go without saying but I'll say it anyways but the sauce recipe as well as the meatball mixture recipe is going to be blow and be jewel more drop-down arrow so there's two eggs here and then this mixture here and the cup is very very savory and that's gonna be again down below I'm gonna mix it all together basically the table student of oregano the tablespoons of Italian seasoning and give it to a very small and so we're gonna go with a quarter and a half a pound of mild Italian sausage you could use hot if you like or just a different meat all together but this is what I'm using in a two pounds of beef and I'm gonna make medium size make meatballs so I I'm one of those people that want every bite to taste as much like the last one as possible so I mix a lot if you see that premix the egg and the spices to go into this and I'm mixing the meat so I get an even distribution of Italian sausage and beef in any to meatball so I do more mixing than most people but that's just me so here I am with the mixture to mix it all around there laid it flat and just spreading it around before I even start even start to mix mix and the cool thing about this recipe is that it's not going to use bread crumbs because breadcrumbs and carp so it's keto inspired you know friendly it's not strict keto but it's it's very very low carb so in place of the breadcrumbs gonna use crushed pork rind no carbs [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so since this is a meatball instead of a solid meat like a steak or chicken I'm gonna use apple instead of mesquite or oak or Hickory apple to me has a milder flavor so the smoke is gonna penetrate a meatball much easier than with a solid meat and this is a from a family friend bill will cut down on apple tree to clear some land and he was nice enough to think of me and cut me some apple chunks so I'm gonna put this on the right side of the grill and the meat and the left side for indirect to zone cooking and we just had a gut start pop in should have been my daughter not sure [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] cooking times and temps will be below as mentioned but I wanted to go between 350 and 400 and about an hour and that'll vary on how many times you open me the hood how pad or how cold it is outside [Music] the end result you just want to make sure that your meatballs are at 165 degrees Celsius for food safety no one wants to get sick listen to that sizzle and the aforementioned opening to check on the would it catch on fire and I just gave you some water want some smoke and now we're getting some color on these meatballs from that smoke and from the cooking process - of course and I'm just gonna turn them around for or even cooking [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so most of these are not quite there yet so we just want to get up to 165 like I said and I'm gonna close the hood here and finish them off bring them up the tub [Music] okay the meatballs all came to temp and here's that sauce everything smells great right now [Music] Kito friendly meatballs battalion meatballs with ego friendly sauce [Music] and what we did is we had green beans with this and the rest of the family had a carb with it [Music] but I'm happy to report that this was very good it was a good cook came together great the sauce and the meatballs everything was just great very happy with it

today in the friend had a friend have a request to just make a box of samples of different Kato friendly Lokar boom fruity tweets that gave a bed trembling curly would offer to the public that doesn't contain any processed sugars any like wheat flour kind of what we specialize in flower power muffins we're gonna make a garlic cheese all right so first we're going to start with three tablespoons of melted butter grass-fed butter that's about a tablespoon and a half of cream cheese that could have been sour cream I'm choosing cream cheese today just out of preference one cup of heavy whipping cream and two eggs as you can already tell you this recipe is about to be high fat which is more of the Cato way of eating low carb and high fat since this is a muffin but we're gonna use as our base is actually going to be looping flour so I'm stepping away for a moment to get my spoon but we're actually gonna add the loop and flour next so we're gonna do one full cup and looking flour comes from the loop Heaney be the loop inna bean is necessarily a considered a low carb item but interestingly enough when it turns into Lukey flour it is actually low carb so it's perfect for keto diets and I folks that are diabetic and watching the carbs or people who are gluten free and choose not to actually eat wheat flours I'm just scraping up a cup to make sure we get the full cup of Lupin flour and we're gonna mix now as we mix away we're now going to add the xanthium gun so is anything gone there's something optional I'm using it as a thickening agent but if you are gluten-free that's something that we wouldn't use in your recipes and next we're going to add the baking soda as our baking powder and we're doing one tablespoon of those each next we're gonna do sweetener so I'm just talking you through a couple sweeteners the first one there was so little solace this one is monkey fruit so each sweetener kind of has its pros and cons every one that I'm showing you here it's low carb this is a leaders Avalos the this is not necessarily my favorite one to bake with but it is a good one for Candis your throughout the one I have here is made from payer so it's not a GMO version so it is a good version we used but the sweetener of choice that I plan to you today is swerve it's something available at your local grocery stores typically and I'm only going to use a tablespoon because this is not a sweet muffin more of a savory muffin so we're just putting in a little bit of sweetener next is both onion powder and garlic powder so we're going to put in a teaspoon of each of those if you want to make your muffins really strong feel free to use more of a tablespoon than a teaspoon and you might also want to add salt I'm choosing not to add salt to have a salt salt free version but if you like salted and it's okay in your diet feel free to add it you also notice I added a half a cup of cheese so we're going to mix this all together and right before we bake it we are going to add a pad of butter to each muffin so we're gonna spread these into six month and tins add a pad of butter to each muffin and top of cheese and bake for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees and we'll show you

require quite a bit of work so I want to show you a super easy and quick way to make keto bread like 2-minute quick way to make bread just in case you don't have enough time or you don't want to go through the whole hassle of making a whole loaf of bread so that being said let's get started and I'll show you my two-minute keto bread recipe alright so first things first you'll want to get out your food skill because we're gonna be weighing these ingredients out to the gram and you're also gonna want to get out a medium sized Bowl so when you got both of those out the next thing is just getting out the ingredients and the base of our keto bread recipe today is blanched almond flour I've recently switched to using Kirkland's blanched almond flour because it has the lowest net carbs I've ever seen for almond flour for 30 grams it only has two net carbs which is way less than the Bob's Red Mill and also this kirklands almond flour is much cheaper than the Bob's Red Mill as well anyways for today's keto bread recipe you want to add four tablespoons or 56 grams of that blanched almond flour to your bowl and then once you've added the almond flour the next thing you want to add is some unflavored whey protein powder today I'm using the unflavored whey from ice appear I really like this stuff because it bakes extremely well and it has zero carbs a lot of times you can replace a little bit of the flour of a recipe with unflavored whey and it reduces the carb count of a recipe so with that being said for today's keto bread recipe I'm gonna add a half a scoop or 15 grams of that to the bowl I'm also gonna sweeten the keto bread up just a little bit without adding any carbs by using a half a teaspoon of confectioner's your ethanol we also want the bread to rise a little bit so we're gonna add a heaping half teaspoon of baking powder as well as a quarter teaspoon of example gum and then last but not least we're gonna add 70 grams of water to the mix so now at this point you want to mix all those ingredients until a thick batter starts to form in the bowl once that better does form and all the ingredients dissolve into one another that's when you want to get out a three cup Tupperware container because it kind of looks like a slice of bread when you think about it the base of the container anyways and then at this point you want to generously coat it with baking spray add the batter to the container and then evenly spread it out with a spatula so now at this point our keto bread is ready to go in the microwave and all microwaves have different power levels my microwave is a 700 watt microwave which is really so in my microwave the keto bread takes two minutes to cook but your microwave is probably more powerful than mine and will most likely take less time to cook anyways once the bread is done cooking its gonna end up looking something like this and at this point you want to take it out of the container transfer it to a cutting board and use a bread knife to cut it in half by the way this is what the inside of the 2-minute bread looks like it's absolutely spot on white bread consistency I also like to cut these half's in half just to make four slices of keto bread this way each slice only has one that carb also the skeeto bread toasts incredibly well so that's what I usually do with it and then check this out this is what the toast ends up looking like how good does that look so good right I hope you guys enjoy the bread if you want more information about it there's more info in the video description below enjoy guys", "ZzvHKFNL3_4": "how're you guys doing today this is Sarah cows with th fcns comm and today I'm going to show you guys how to make some really quick bacon tuna melts I'm hungry so let's get to it first things first take out a bowl big enough to mix all your ingredients together in and then take out 2 cans of tuna doesn't matter what type of tuna you're using today I'm using solid white and water and what you're gonna want to do is drain your tuna and then we're gonna put it into our Bowl once you've finished draining your tuna just put it into the bowl afford the teaspoon of lemon and pepper 1/8 a teaspoon of garlic salt or regular salt 1/2 a teaspoon of minced garlic or around 1 clove of regular garlic 5 tablespoons or 75 grams of a fat-free mayonnaise 4 tablespoons or 28 grams of real bacon bits you could also use turkey bacon bits as well take out 1 cup or a hundred grams of celery and chop it which is usually around one and a half branches once you've chopped it put it into your mix and last two-thirds a cup or 56 grams of our reduced fat cheddar cheese wash one of your hands and you're just gonna mix everything together with that hand pre-heat your oven on 350 and then take out some aluminum foil how many squares of aluminum foil you're going to need depends on how many tuna melts you're gonna make I'm gonna make two so I make my squares about that big now just shape your tuna melts and put them into the center of your aluminum foil squares that's about how big I make mine all you're gonna do now is wrap your tuna melts up by folding over the tinfoil so it looks something like that once your tuna melts are wrapped up put them on top of a baking sheet and then put them in the oven on 350 for 15 minutes as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's five hundred and eight 20 grams of fat only 14 grams of carbs and 68 grams of protein so if you make two like I did there's only 254 calories per tuna melt 10 grams of fat only 7 grams of carbs and 34 grams of protein after 15 minutes take them out and let them cool so here's my favorite thing to do with this recipe I like to buy some white cheddar rice cakes and then just simply put the tuna melt on top of the rice cake and then eat it like a sandwich in there are your bacon tuna melts as you guys saw the tuna melts are done so now I'm just gonna try a bite for you guys I really don't think that there's a better combo in a tuna melt then cheddar cheese bacon and garlic absolutely delicious all the flavors come together there is so much flavor unbelievably good and even the white cheddar rice cake makes it that much better especially if you're trying to cut down on carbs and what I mean by that is rice cakes only have 8 grams of carbs per serving whereas the piece of bread can have anywhere from 20 to 25 grams of carbs alright guys I just want to thank you for watching if you like my bacon tuna melt recipe please go ahead and give me a thumbs up it motivates me to keep making

good [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel i'm myra from low carb love and today we're going to be making a keto cauli mash and gravy so during thanksgiving like one of the things that is usually always on the table is some mashed potatoes and gravy so i figured that i would make a keto version low carb version for you guys so these are absolutely delicious to be honest with you even my family that is not low carb or of course not keto they absolutely love this dish so get ready to be in love it's going to be creamy and cheesy and delicious and of course we're going to have a delicious gravy on the side so we're going to get started there are a few um little steps to this but it's so worth it and it's so easy so i've already started just to save some time here um i had a whole cauliflower so the whole head of cauliflower here and i obviously just broke it up into pieces and i boiled this until it basically started falling apart like you can see it is very very very tender whoopsie it's very tender and if you don't want to use a whole cauliflower you can use rice cauliflower i usually use that but i was out and so we grabbed this at the grocery store and it's going to come out just as delicious so either or will work whatever you have on hand is um is what you should use so after you boil this say 15 minutes or so um you want to drain the water of course and um so now we have it here set on the side and what we're gonna do is we're going to prepare our butter okay so i'm gonna pour this into our bowl this is where we're going to be mixing everything into and i'm going to [Music] put our butter and our garlic right into this little pan i just don't want to use any additional pans because your girl washes everything by hand um i'm just not a like dishwasher type of person okay so we have our butter here we have this is our butter we have four tablespoons of butter and we are going to add our garlic so i'm just using some minced garlic just like that and we are going to do two teaspoons of minced garlic if you want to use fresh garlic then you would use about you would use about two garlic cloves okay so we have two right there and now we're gonna go ahead and put this on the stovetop mix it together and we're gonna make a delicious garlic butter so let's go okay so we have our heat on now we are going to add a quarter teaspoon of salt because we are using unsalted butter i usually don't ever use unsalted butter but that's what i accidentally picked up even though some people really do like to control their you know the salt on their dishes it's never a problem for me so let's let this heat up cook that garlic and then we'll move on okay so we have our butter [Music] here's our garlic butter okay and we're gonna use this pan again but for now let's just put it aside and add the rest of our ingredients okay i'm gonna do one tablespoon of heavy cream one tablespoon of heavy cream we're gonna do three tablespoons of let's put a little more but we have three tablespoons of sour cream and i should have had everything measured out but you know mom life guys sometimes it doesn't work out that way so i'm gonna add some pepper this is just to taste whoa it's a little much but it's fine i love pepper we're gonna add a little salt a little more salt here is a quarter teaspoon then we'll taste it after and see if it needs more okay now we are going to do a quarter cup let's go ahead and do some parmesan cheese okay so we have some parmesan cheese this is just grated parmesan cheese so freshly grated and this is completely optional but i'm a fan of sharp cheddar so we're just gonna add that in there you can see that [Music] sharp cheddar in my opinion just that's where it's at but i would say it's just too taste so this is my last little piece of sharp cheddar so we're just going to finish it off because it's just going to add sharpness to your to your mash and you can um if you want to just use a quarter cup of cheese alone you can do that um i obviously added a little more and it's gonna be just fine you guys are gonna eat it just like me okay so now magic we have a food processor we're going to pour everything into our food processor so i literally just put everything on here so that it can be easy and we can just transfer it in try not to make a mess um so there it is we have our cauliflower our cheese our butter garlic everything in here yum okay now we're just going to run this through the food processor here we go okay now look at that beauty beautiful wow so if you want it a little chunky you can leave it you know a little chunkier but this right here is like the real deal guys i can't wait for you to try this you're going to love this recipe so now we ran this to the food processor we have the smoothness that we want and desire so now let's go ahead and we are actually going to put it back on the stove top to make sure that that garlic and cheese and everything is cooked and um yeah and it is perfect so let's grab let's go ahead and put this back in here and just make sure you grab your spatula to scrape everything off because this is like liquid gold right here guys here that's not like you know you don't want any of this going away at all so we have everything back in here let's go to the stove and make sure that everything is good cooked hot cheesy so

chicken bone broth we are doing a half cup which is there half cup of bone broth one tablespoon of butter and then we are going to use this little xanthan gum here which we are using a quarter teaspoon and this is going to be our thickener so i will link everything down below okay so throw quarter teaspoon of xanthan and now we are going to throw it on the heat let it bubble up and i will show you what it looks like we're going to pour it all in to our bowl while the gravy is thickening [Music] okay guys so now we turn off the heat this is a consistency you are looking for and now let's go ahead and take it back to the countertop i mean to the table and we will take both our mash our cauli mash and our gravy okay so let's go ahead and do the taste test okay so look at our gravy

this\u00a0\u00a0 regular old steak it looks worse than it it looks\u00a0\nit looks worse than it tastes yeah absolutely yeah\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely and I've got some black beans here\u00a0\nwhich I'm gonna kind of squish up a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 okay and put a little black bean puree on there so\u00a0\ncommander Hatfield's making this in space what's\u00a0\u00a0 his procedures so he's gonna have this he's gonna\u00a0\nhave a steak this is these are both gonna be warm\u00a0\u00a0 all right and he's gonna have this tortilla it's\u00a0\ngonna squirt the beans on take a couple pieces of\u00a0\u00a0 the steak stick them in there yep and a little\u00a0\ncrunch here I like you know a little texture I\u00a0\u00a0 think that that's lacking in a lot of his food so\u00a0\nsome of this freeze-dried rice okay little crunch\u00a0\u00a0 so you're not gonna rehydrate it no I'm not gonna\u00a0\nbe hydrated I'm gonna put it on there just like\u00a0\u00a0 this okay there's a little crunchy element and\u00a0\nsee what it see what exactly in a little Tabasco\u00a0\u00a0 and that's good that sounds great let's put it\u00a0\ntogether and see what it tastes like what's it\u00a0\u00a0 everything has velcro patches yes and I'm gonna\u00a0\ncute yeah it's really neat I mean they think of\u00a0\u00a0 everything so I'm gonna open up the steak okay\u00a0\nI'm gonna take the beans and swish them a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit okay a little bit they recommend that was the\u00a0\nturntable right yeah exactly so we're gonna kind\u00a0\u00a0 of do a curious thing going on here cut our little\u00a0\ncorner I'm imagining that I'm in space right there\u00a0\u00a0 I even notice you have your hair back so you don't\u00a0\nhave that crazy astronaut exactly and it tear this\u00a0\u00a0 up a little bit just a little pieces okay so just\u00a0\na bite size chunks patient actually we don't have\u00a0\u00a0 any utensils up there any knives rather there's no\u00a0\nchopping station yeah exactly all right dr. Tiye\u00a0\u00a0 so how do these tortillas compare to you they're\u00a0\nlike normal kind of commercials is how they sleep\u00a0\u00a0 it's not very doughy okay they're really moist\u00a0\nand doughy we've been told that they're they\u00a0\u00a0 have less water than a traditional really which\u00a0\nis why they're shelf-stable just cuz all the food\u00a0\u00a0 on the station has to last for six to nine months\u00a0\ndepending on I think they go for a 12-month shelf\u00a0\u00a0 right okay you know the bean paste is the glue\u00a0\nyeah it's a little surface to surface tension I\u00a0\u00a0 learned that today I didn't weigh exactly it's how\u00a0\nthings stick to other things like Lay's stick the\u00a0\u00a0 steak in there and you want to open that up yeah\u00a0\nyou know little spice happening a little sprinkle\u00a0\u00a0 here you can't just pour that in space that won't\u00a0\nwork no I know well actually I think you could if\u00a0\u00a0 you were close enough to it you have to kind of\u00a0\nyeah you have a kind of you know and grab it at\u00a0\u00a0 the same time all right you ready for this oh\u00a0\nthere we go it's a being buried a beef steak\u00a0\u00a0 burrito yeah I think we should taste it what\u00a0\ndo you see how you doing I'm going to give it\u00a0\u00a0 a little roll here hmm there's a little quick from\u00a0\nthe chicken and right the right seam the chicken\u00a0\u00a0 advice not bad this is entirely there's a definite\u00a0\nimprovement over all the core component you can\u00a0\u00a0 imagine someone at college eating like that on a\u00a0\nregular basis I much much worse stuff into that in\u00a0\u00a0 college oh thank you so much Tracy will send the\u00a0\nrecipe up to commander Hatfield and see what he\u00a0\u00a0 thinks and see you guys so how'd that burrito turn\u00a0\nout Tracey put together a great recipe but like a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of people who are away from their own kitchen\u00a0\nit's kind of hard to find all the ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 exactly but what I did come up with was tortillas\u00a0\nbeef stick and I found red beans and rice in one\u00a0\u00a0 package red beans and rice plus hot sauce so I\u00a0\nthink with these ingredients I can come pretty\u00a0\u00a0 close to will make something delicious excellent\u00a0\nokay reading Tracey's recipe what I'm supposed to\u00a0\u00a0 do is take the bean paste and the steak and the\u00a0\ntortillas and put them in the warming oven step 1 okay blue piping hot ready to mix up trace\u00a0\nrecipe was to open up the tortilla squirt on\u00a0\u00a0 the nice warm bean paste and then break up the\u00a0\nbeef steak put the V stick in there squirt on\u00a0\u00a0 some hot sauce roll it up like a burrito good\u00a0\nET let's give it a try space tortilla last 18\u00a0\u00a0 months in this package cut my tortilla ready\u00a0\nnow my bean paste nice and warm the corner\u00a0\u00a0 kind of open so it makes sort of like a little\u00a0\nscrewy nozzle so I can square it straight on well that works well okay we get the\u00a0\nbeans and rice and now time to make\u00a0\u00a0 the steak what I'm gonna do with\u00a0\nthat in the meanwhile and hold it\u00a0\u00a0 in my tortilla package carefully velcro\u00a0\nthat to the table while I wait perfect beefsteak Tracy sent to break it up into pieces\u00a0\u00a0 and put it in the tortilla\u00a0\nit's starting to look good ready for yesterday's Icehouse space\u00a0\nhot sauce didn't read nice and spicy hot sauce okay what we have here is beans rice\u00a0\nbeef hot sauce all wrapped up in a tortilla\u00a0\u00a0 that makes it time to try Traci's recipe let's\u00a0\nsee how it is the beauty of eating burrito or\u00a0\u00a0 tortilla inspaces nothing can fall out the\u00a0\nbest it can do is sort of float next to you I'll eat this in you watch that it that's us so it ended up being tasty\u00a0\ngood Chris how much more difficult is\u00a0\u00a0 it to assemble a meal and microgravity\u00a0\nthan it is on earth it's pretty hard\u00a0\u00a0 to put everything together normally as\u00a0\nastronauts we just don't make a mash-up\u00a0\u00a0 we don't mix our food up we just eat\u00a0\nit one thing after another in a row Jamie Adam you guys probably think this cool our\u00a0\nstraw as a valve on earth so we can shut it on\u00a0\u00a0 and off so the stuff doesn't come squirting out\u00a0\nall over the place nice very cool so what's your\u00a0\u00a0 first meal gonna be when you get back on earth\u00a0\nwhen you first get back to Earth of course you\u00a0\u00a0 feel sick and busy you don't feel like eating at\u00a0\nall it takes a while for your digestive system to\u00a0\u00a0 get used to be pushed down with gravity on your\u00a0\nstomach and everything else so it takes a few\u00a0\u00a0 days but once I get my appetite back I'm really\u00a0\nlooking forward to fresh-baked bread smell coming\u00a0\u00a0 out of the oven to slather a little butter on\u00a0\ntop and then also pizza piping hot thin crust\u00a0\u00a0 veggie pizza extra sauce well Chris I hope we were\u00a0\nable to spice things up a little bit for you up\u00a0\u00a0 there thanks bye Chris

house genetics cross platinum cross to GMO platinum is uh looks super resinous and she'll hold on I know the lineage it's um it's a u-dub hashed plant permafrost let's get this rolled so the look looks pretty nice it's got a nice tight note structure I've got some deep purple's in there and let's see if it's turning to powder hopefully it does not that doesn't turn the powder so that's good let's see how the smell is once I break it up so look pretty nice it's got a nice dense chunky uh nug structure it's got some nice color to it nice structure alright let's smell it's like a diet GMO it's not as loud as GMO it's got some like subtle hash enos to it in the front but uh pretty cool it's definitely something that I would smoke just because it's got that funky to your most melon taste I'm all about that y'all know me I know I love GMO and GMO crosses I'm not using this whole favor it'll be too much paper I got short paper girls around here some way I just can't find him right now have you tried GMO or any other good GMO crosses besides GMO let me know down in the comment section below definitely like to hear what you guys think about a GMO and Gmail crosses just based off of my experience GMO crosses don't go nearly as long as GMO don't stretch as much as GMO I mean certain fee knows might but I haven't seen one that goes longer than GMO itself we had some feelers that went pretty [ __ ] long like we had some 12 week crosses like some 12 week fee knows and the the kitchen sinks in the party files and stuff but we obviously phase those out because commercially it's not worth it when the other sisters are pretty much finishing two weeks earlier in the last shorter and pretty much this is good of a resin content all right let's get a roll so it's got decent it's got some good points on looking smell it ready all right got it rolled don't you guys check it out check out the joint work all right get the light off fire and an ashtray all right I don't know if you guys know about like roasting the joint and like tasting it after the front end there's just been heated up and then take a dry pool to see the Terps that come off of it so let's see for looks I'm gonna get my phone so I can start taking some math down all right so for looks I'm gonna give this one for sure like a four well 375 actually for smell 375 it's a subtle GMO it's not as loud I mean it definitely has a nice smell to it but it's not crazy like oh my god it's got a nice taste then again that's just like the first two hits so let me see how actually tastes once I finish smoking more there was another entry that I smoked last night I'm not even gonna do a video on I was trying to Buddha it scanned weed I mean the can weed looks nice but I'd say I've opened the lid like the the silver lining on the top of it I waited a day to look at her to get her and got [ __ ] dry so my and then when I tried to smoke in it it just didn't [ __ ] smoke well it didn't burn I said I have to join over there I just wasn't burning properly um flavors in tax still I gotta get some more stickers done this is one of my last ones I had to like rip off just so I didn't have to you know show people what my local on sticker image was gotta get some more stickers before the cup demo cup is coming up next week hope to see you there hope to me some new people make new connections find out some you know what's going on in the world that I might be interested in cannabis related so definitely hope to see out there I try to make every cannabis cup I can because I want to learn and have as many different reference points from a bunch of different strains as possible I want to see as much wheat as possibly can on the roads becoming that kind of as something yeah that I'm telling you how about being a chef definitely helped so having tastebuds that pretty much are very sensitive hmm definitely uh is a gift in a curse but when it comes to cannabis it's definitely you have to not really do uh recommend anybody that is trying to define the palette more to learn a little bit about culinary and study some stuff there and then when you try and translate all over that translate all that over to cannabis it'll definitely help a lot all right so it's burnin smooth it's not like making my throat like hot and dry and all that [ __ ] let me not a [ __ ] after like a few more hits oh you can see the way it ash is the ash content and all that the bird right see I enjoy smoking this right now because uh it's very smooth it's not like um certain strains well I don't even want to say certain strains like so the way certain strains are grown it could just be the way to grow up period it doesn't even have to be destroyed just I'll smoke people's will even it's just like hot dry and like tastes like nothing really my dispensary weed it's pretty decent I'm sure you the ash good decent color ash I was burning nice and smooth and even it's not gonna win more points on that usually like GMO floors me but for some reason I don't feel this one really doing much to me especially being like the first joint of the mornin for it not even first join this is like giving me getting hot for the first time in the morning and usually that's a really good way to tell if something's uh effective or not because pretty much it's like been uh I'm gonna say fasting but yeah didn't smoke me like at least eight hours or some [ __ ] look though so ash is nice so look smell taste is 375 yes a 3.75 for looks 3.75 for smell 3.75 for taste 4.0 for burn probably might be a little bit too generous on some of these then again I don't know if it's cuz I have the GMO bias I'm not trying to then he didn't like this isn't some of the better Gmail crosses that I've seen there's been a lot better out there I can't speak for every phenotype from the platinum garlic I'm just specifically talking about this one for effect I'm gonna give it like a 2.5 it's very light 21 point 5 divided by 5 equals 4.3 really yeah I think I might have been a little bit too generous on like certain scores I probably have to go back over what I have left of it but I was the platinum garlic video guys I'll be doing the next one pretty soon I hope to see you at the next one thank you for your time you", "0Du4XC917Lk": "i will cut this off today and baby everyone feels fake somewhere i lost a piece of me smoking cigarettes [Music] hey guys it's manu and welcome to a new video today we're gonna be making keto bread in less than five minutes and hear this without any eggs that's right this is a recipe you are going to love are you ready these are the ingredients one tablespoon of butter one tablespoon of flax meal three tablespoons of water three tablespoons of almond flour half a tablespoon of coconut flour salt half a teaspoon of baking powder the first thing we need to do is create our egg supplement so what we're gonna use is a tablespoon of flax meal and three tablespoons of water in a lot of vegan recipes this is the egg replacement um and also chia seeds with water that will give the final product the density it needs so we're just going to mix the flax meal with the water and let it sit for about five minutes [Applause] [Music] now that the flax meal and water mixture is ready we are going to melt the butter we're going to do everything in this mug um if you wanted to to bake this in the oven and not the not use the microwave don't worry you can and i will give you the baking instructions at the end also if you wanted to make this recipe entirely vegan or dairy free you can sub the butter for coconut oil avocado oil or olive oil without any problem so let's put this in the microwave for 15 seconds for the butter to melt so the butter is melted but not hot now all there's left to do is add all of the ingredients the first thing i'm gonna add is the flax meal water mixture mix it with the butter and then just add all of the other ingredients [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you might notice that we're using twice as much leavening agent or baking powder in this case than most mug cake recipes most of my mug cakes recipes call for a quarter teaspoon and of of baking powder here as we don't have the egg and it's lev and it's leavening um as a leavening agent we need a little extra kick for this to grow and actually be a bread we are ready to go into the microwave this muk cake keto bread is going to take a little longer to cook than if we were using egg now the flax meal will make the bread really moist inside and it will seem like it's undercooked so we're gonna put this in the microwave initially for two and a half minutes and we should be ready to go if you were to use a conventional oven bake it at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes after two and a half minutes this is what we have it's not gonna grow as much as other mug cakes um the egg really does a lot of things for recipes so when we sub it out um the end result is gonna vary but that doesn't mean this isn't gonna be delicious it is amazing we're gonna unmold it let it cool a little and slice it in half to make two toasts but you gotta be there for me too [Music] so that's it guys super quick and easy keto bread not only that ready in five minutes and it is eggless i know some of you are allergic to eggs or actually vegan and don't eat eggs well this version has butter but i told you the sub you can make if you want to make it a hundred percent i have to be honest with you um i would say 99 of my experience is baking uh and cooking with eggs with dairy but i am incorporating more recipes for you guys because i know there's a lot of you that don't eat eggs that don't add dairy so i'm gonna keep experimenting but for now this recipe is amazing once you slice the bread you basically have two pieces of toast you might think like oh it dried up no that's that's how it's supposed to be let's remember that there's no egg so a lot of the moisture is going to be missing but amazing toast amazing keto bread i'm gonna give you the macros for the entire thing um now let's just give it a taste i i actually served it with butter because i do eat butter here we go wow wow i really hope you guys try out this recipe even if you are able to eat eggs just like me but it's super tasty super easy to make and sometimes i think that's what we miss or at least that's what i miss the most on the keto diet bread i wasn't a huge sweet sweet tooth person um but i did love sandwiches and breads that's why i think i have so many recipes actually my second book which right now it's only available in spanish but will be available in english has over 100 recipes of keto breads and desserts so um i hope you guys make this recipe and if it is your first time watching

making a video on the friendly farms cured resin cartridge this is some gmo so let's get straight into it all right y'all so this is the friendly farms and gmo cartridge this is going to be cure resin they have a live resin version and then they have a um cured resin version so there's going to be the cured version um i don't know what the difference is i never personally had live resin one but uh somebody tell me what's the difference between cured resin and live resin because i'm pretty curious to see or if actually i'll probably just look it up and put it up right now but this is this is what the packaging is going to be looking like man like i said gmo is going to be an indica it's going to be a black box with a yellow writing that's kind of what they're known for that their main color is a yellow so it's gonna have that up front fresh cure liquid you guys can pause that to read it it says uh farm friend all natural from plant to pan no additives distill it free and this is the bag looks pretty cool in the back i'll put a picture of it [Music] and the top is just the uh sticker of the dispensary that i got it from i got it from a firehouse in sherlock california um west west main street turn like california i forgot the address but it's called firehouse uh just look it up on we maps um so when you open so to open the package it's gonna so to open the package you're gonna have to rip the sticker right here and then you just open it like this and it's gonna come with the cart in there and it comes with this piece of paper uh i'm not sure if it's actually scanning or some [ __ ] to receive fifty percent off or something i don't know something or something like so my honest thoughts about this opinion so my honest opinion so my honest thoughts about this pen man i will not get this card again and i don't recommend that you guys get it um this card as you guys can see i'll give you guys a closer look right but the now on this is [ __ ] horrible man the taste of this reminds me of taking the hit from a dirty bomb like that's exactly what it tastes like dirty weed from a dirty ball or it tastes like good weed hitting it from a dirty ass bong you know what i'm saying uh you guys here with a bong if you guys have hit a bomb before like that you guys know exactly what i'm talking about but uh the guy told me this was his favorite one but i caught cap i think he was just saying that you know so i could get so he could like sell me like sell me this um this tastes like trash man i let all my friends hit it and they do not like the taste but i will say nah i'm gonna say this this is probably one of the worst pens i've had um this is better than the jeter cart for sure it gets you way higher than the jeter cart and the only way i'm able to enjoy this pen is by doing uh the the dab cap with the with the bong because it gets rid of the flavor and that way you're able to get a lot higher without the nasty flavor and one thing about this is i forgot where it said on the i think it was on the box or maybe it's on this paper that it says in hell for one second using a low voltage battery 2.0 through 2.7 volts recommended repeat this step after a couple of minutes if you like if you would like a stronger effect adjust your battery to under three volts and inhale for four three through six seconds let the cartridge cool for 30 to 60 seconds between hits to ensure that that you do not burn the oil so with that being said the maximum that i recommend you hit this car is like five seconds um i haven't hit a blinker of it yet just because i don't want to burn the oil and there's so much left but i'll probably take a blinker of it for you guys just for the video just so you guys can see and i'll let you guys know it tastes like burp and so that way you guys don't have to do it yourself but i'll recommend using at least the max 3 3.3 volts max i believe this one is vaping at 3.3 volts in the lowest setting which is green and then i have another honeydew battery which also smokes at 3.3 i don't have anything lower than that so that's all i was able to use but for me it's been working fine even though they did say to not use a battery above 3 volts so if you guys have that problem just 3.3 is max i would recommend so you guys have a 3.3 volt battery you guys are good don't need to worry about that um but the flavor man i had to give it like a three like a three out of like a three or four out of ten man horrible horrible flavor um the high i would have to give it like a five uh maybe like a five and a half um like i said it's one of the worst cards i've had but not the worst um i would recommend a lot of cards over this daisy kingpin select a lot of things i would recommend before this and i had a lot of friends telling me not to go not to get it but i have not made a video on it so i wanted to see for myself and it turns out they were right i have yet to try the live resident win so i'm not sure about that one but this one man the uh cured resin is a no go for me man i have not tried the editing labs yet though so i don't know how that would work but um sorry for my long hair too man i'm about to get a haircut on i haven't cut the top of my hair for over a year and a half and for or like about a year and a half and i'm gonna go get an undercut on the sides real quick so next time when when you guys i'm gonna upload a dispensary video if you guys didn't see the video i just uploaded before this one i'm gonna make it uh i'm gonna film the dispensary run today and i'm gonna have my hair cut in here so you guys can see how fresh i'm gonna look for the ladies watching if there even is any but um but yeah man like i said do not recommend this car just um if you tried a lot of carts already and like this is one of the only ones you haven't tried or this is all you could get it's not that bad to the point where it's like if you haven't had it um you know don't get it like go get it see if you like it it's worth getting it it's gonna get you high you won't i'm not saying you won't be disappointed but you won't regret that you bought it because i don't regret that i bought it just because i've never had it you feel what i'm saying but uh yeah man if you guys were just wondering this is a good card and it's not so get another one but if you want to try it i would recommend to try it because who knows you might like it um everybody you know likes different stuff so let's take a hit of this cart man and so you guys can see some cloud production i'll take a blinker right off the rip i've never done it like i said because i don't want to burn the oil but hopefully it doesn't burn the oil and if it does you guys don't have to burn your oil because i'm doing it for you so let's take a hit with my dirty ass rig if you guys haven't seen my dab cat video make sure to go watch it you just put any type of pants dizzy plug and play any type of pen circular anything you put it on there then you grab your rig put it just like like this into the hole and take a rip so i'm gonna take a bleeder for you guys ready cheers came up that's my first hit of the day too first time the day took a blinker like i said i've never took a blinker from this car and i've had it for like a week already so holy [ __ ] so like i said man it's not a bad car by any means but i would definitely i'm not gonna buy this car again for sure it was cool to try it though because i was really curious i've been debating on buying this for a couple couple months now so it's cool that i got it um so like i

out the door um that's after taxes and everything you guys can see that i'm pretty sure you guys saw that in my last video in this bench for you but i showed it to you guys but yeah 36 dollars out the door when i cop again [ __ ] no overall rating man like like a six maybe like a five just because the flavor is horrible i would not get this unless you have the dab cap and the rig because that's the best way to work like that [ __ ] hit bro when i took that blinker right now i have not took a bleep from this cart so that was crazy i doubt i could take a bleeper without that because it's just too nasty but that's gonna be for the video y'all hopefully y'all enjoy the video hopefully that's awesome hopefully i'll learn something and uh hopefully i'll inspire y'all to go get this or not get this

you don't know me and welcome back to my channel or welcome to my channel if you guys are new here I am back with another taste test today your girl is gonna make the claimed best keto chocolate cake I found this recipe online it's keto it's low carb it's sugar free if you're using the ingredients that I am I am so excited to try this I love me some chocolate too and if it turns out well you know I would recommend it to you guys if you guys want to know how I made this cake I'll include it in the next few clips I'm posting it for a ticked-off but the thing I'm not posting for tik-tok is how I made the whipped topping the whipped cream and frosting so you guys are pretty much getting the full package on you the full tutorial on how I made this please subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and turn on that notification bellow so you won't be missing out every single time when I post and also throw me I like already yeah oh my god I am so excited for this one first thing add 1 and 1/2 cups of almond flour in a mixing bowl 1/3 of a cup of cocoa powder 2 and 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of salt mix those together add 3 eggs to a separate bowl for the wet ingredients third cup milk of choice in vanilla extract 1/3 cup of monk fruit sweetener in mixed that up and pour it into the dry ingredients and mix some more Riis an 8 inch baking tray and add the mixture in and now we bake her at 350 for 15 minutes takes only 15 minutes well it says cook until it's firm bake until it's firm as I should say it looked me like a brownie right now or it says to have 1 minute left on the timer and I don't think she even rolls I mean it doesn't even look like that much has changed but maybe because I was supposed to use an 8 inch pan but this should work out so let's see when she comes out and when I whip up some frosting for her can we give this a taste let's see if she's the only time when I could use that word when you're talking about cake or maybe she's not supposed to rise but smell and great looks just like cake I want to poke it but I'm supposed to let her cool actually we're supposed to check if she's firm so yeah firm you guys I sure hope this tastes good because I made a whole pan of that chocolate cake I'm a little concerned because it just looks just the way I put it in it's just a little more firm than it was less although this is good you're really extremely happy if I find a recipe that I love you know while we wait for the cake to cool we are gonna be making some whipped cream for the frosting I know there's a lot of butter cream or cream cheese fillings out there but today I'm gonna make use of my whipped cream in my fridge we were gonna make chocolate whipped cream what you need for it is 1 cup of whipping cream going in this should cover the whole cake we're gonna add in 4 tablespoons of cocoa powder since I'm on keto we are gonna add in 4 tablespoons of monk fruit sweetener and then that's it now we whip this up until it's nice and thick okay this is what it looks like it's pretty much over whip look how thick this is when I pull it up it's not that soft so this would be a nice spread for my cake yeah I'm starting to think that it's not rising up because of all many flowers this is not just regular flower completely cooled now we are just gonna add our boot cream on top of it I wish I had one of those piping bags to make them look pretty we're just gonna slap this on and now my mouth is complete look of our chocolate cake I'm gonna cut a slice AHA it looks just like cake look how spongy it looks inside you could see that she's glistening that's know that she's moist that sounds a little wrong if you hate that word let me know in the comments below if you hate that word or you don't mind that word oh my god take a look at oh hey guys I actually did a double layer on this I know it's kind of like Suede's and all in here is the cake I had to put more icing on this side since we got extra you know what can we just take a look at this it looks just exactly like chocolate cake I gave some to my parents and sister to try you guys the cake is almost gone but I waited so we can taste test this they're finishing their plate so I should have put more coconut oil to grease the pan because some of its thinking but it's not sticking that badly I haven't got myself a cup of almond milk just to eat with this I hope it lives up to the name the best key okay good oh my God look how that breaks ah I wish you guys can smell this this is you know it tastes just like a chocolate cake I don't know how is this possible okay I have to take another bite it's so good it tears up with the whipped cream very much I mean there's a slight green eat a strip from the almond flour but if I'd give this to someone and just let them try it they would not even notice it it's crazy how much it tastes like a regular cake the inside of it is nice I know a lot of people hate this word including myself moist it is moist listen you hear that you hear this squishiness it's not even the top part when you push it down you would hear I tried some tea no mug cakes and some of them have had that egg taste to it and we added three eggs into this cake right here don't even taste the egg so good so amazing y'all need to try this mm-hmm there's even a vegan alternative I'll link it in the description box below I'm going to interest whole thing hmm it's the damn spot you know what I probably prefer this over a regular chocolate cake I would make this every single time another day another cake and another me pretty much look my hair has changed since that best hito chocalate cake came out amazing ten out of ten I had to try a vanilla recipe today so we're gonna make a keto sugar with vanilla hey last time when I baked a cake it was a low carb keto chocolate cake and it turned out amazing might as well be back with a vanilla one as always I find all my rest he's online and this one seems to have good reviews so let's try it out in a large mixing bowl crack in four room-temperature eggs throw in half a cup of monk fruit sweetener two teaspoons of vanilla extract then we got here two tablespoons of melted coconut oil in mix those ingredients together flour and a teaspoon of baking powder in now we spread that batter up in a greased baking pan bake the cake for 25 minutes at 325 this one looks a little more concerning than the chocolate one because when I put in the batter to spread it looks a little chunky and drier than our cocoa chocolate pedo cake this one is in the oven at 325 for a little longer it's in there for about 25 minutes I don't think that it's gonna rise as much just hope this one turns out spongy and nice for us red 25 minutes later you can tell that it's around the edges but I don't think the batter is we're gonna add a cup of whipping cream instead of chocolate we're gonna add in our handy dandy artificial vanilla extract now I'm gonna add in about a teaspoon in here and to sweeten it up this keto friendly mouth root sweetener you grind it up into a powder so you can make it more smooth for the frosting but I don't mind a little bit of readiness to it now mix it up the cake is now ready to cool after an additional five minutes of this cake on the top rack so we can get the top to brown the edges are a little browner but it's Goldin it's not birth and from the underneath I really need to get a glove for this it looks cooked so now we wait for it to cool and then I apply on the frosting okay now that the cake is cooled down the top is really really dry like when I scratch it this is how it sounds it still smells good we still got the frosting to put on so maybe that will help with it so I'm going to spread it all over Jen's looking Kate the taste is good it's vanilla flavored and it does have that vanilla tea taste to it as you can see when I try to break it apart she's still looking dry and she's falling apart it's a very dense cake it's not fluffy and bouncy as the other one I think I should have just searched for the best vanilla cake okay I'm getting my sister to try this by now she said it smells delicious almost has a tea subway okay it's not moist that's the thing for this cake I would have one slight salt so that is my and my sister's review on this vanilla cake I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already turn on that notification about to see whenever I drop a video make sure you give me a thumbs up for this I hope you guys have an amazing day take care of yourself take care of your loved ones make sure you wash your hands and I will see you in the next video bye guys whoa", "nVHDXIdoRvs": "hey y'all welcome back to my channel and welcome back to another addition of this batch cooking weekly meal prep video from me this one is gonna be a big one y'all I had a lot on my plate last weekend when I prepped and a lot to bring to you but before we get into the video I want to say that this is a collab with my really good friend Kim from free to family y'all she is amazing she's the one that got me inspired to make videos with batch cooking I've been meal prepping for a long time but this girl is the batch cooking queen y'all you've got to go and subscribe to her channel if you're not already she's amazing she does batch cooking like a boss every single Sunday on her channel the same day as I post mine she is incredible with how to save money and how to do things efficiently and on a budget so definitely go and give Kim a follow and if you go over there please leave a of akkad o emoji so she news that you came from my channel she's also gonna be posting a meal prep video today so definitely go and watch it after you watch mine so today we're cooking boiled eggs in the instant pot dicing some damn berries shredding some cheese for the week we're gonna be using some pulled pork from Costco I highly recommend making some homemade buffalo hot wing sauce some sloppy joes homemade pulled pork dip for to some jalapeno poppers heat okay so of course keto enchiladas wedding cake cupcakes I know you've been waiting for that and sweet chapels let's get to it so the first thing I like to do when prepping is getting my boiled eggs in my instant pot I'm using these pasture-raised once and like I mentioned in past videos it only takes about a minute and there's still a little overdone because I do keep mine in the instant pot for a little bit after to make sure that the incident pot depressurizes and then I put them in an ice bath with some water as you're gonna see here if you're using regular eggs y'all asked me last week I would say about three minutes I don't like to overcook mine I don't know about y'all but I don't like that weird gray ring on the outside and I just find that if you cook them too long sometimes that happens I love putting them in this storage container from the Dollar Tree and yes it lasts all week being fresh highly recommend then we're going to go in with the damn berries as I like to call them and I wash them right in the container that they come in so efficient we're not wasting something else to have to put in the dishwasher or hand wash let them dry and then I'm gonna go ahead and dice them up and put them in my storage towers that I bought from the Dollar Tree again I mentioned last week these things are still out for back-to-school so definitely go and check Dollar Tree and see if they have those containers because they are the best for storing all kinds of stuff but definitely your berries so we just go ahead and dice them up put them in the fridge and we are good to go [Music] we're also going to be prepping some blackberries blackberries are one of the lower-carb berries as far as spiking blood sugar as y'all on the glycemic index I love blackberries they are amazing and I'm not going to put them in the tower because I didn't have that mini so I'm just putting them in this pyrex dish and gonna pop them in the fridge so they stay nice and fresh now we're going to be shredding up some cheese for the week I'm going in with some mozzarella first a whole block because we're going to need it for the pizzas this week that we're going to be making and for sweet chavos this new grater I got from Amazon because it is like non-skid proof it is amazing y'all and it was relatively cheap so I will link it down below and it's huge as well so I like that it's like a huge grater and holds all the cheese I love putting my cheese in these Dollar Tree containers it stays fresh for weeks upon weeks and it doesn't go bad we're also gonna do half a block of this sharp cheddar cheese that I got from Costco because I'm going to need that for recipes and for other things for the rest of the week and that's about a pound of cheese so I highly recommend getting your cheese from Costco it's like $4.99 for two pounds that's definitely the best deal you're gonna find around better than Walmart it does stick to the grater a little bit more than the mozzarella though as you can see here but we got it out nonetheless we're gonna put the top on here and put it in with our mozzarella cheese and we've got shredded cheese for the week ready to go convenient you don't have to worry about it for the rest of the week I had a little bit of leftover so I'll put it in a ziplock bag and of course we're gonna be using it up because we go through cheese like crazy [Music] okay this pulled pork from Costco is life if you haven't tried this you need this in your life ASAP this one like $9.99 at my Costco y'all can see I just dumped it in the crock-pot put it on high I kept coming back to check it stir it I did not add any barbecue sauce to it I just left it plain so I can add it to different recipes throughout the week and we ate on this all week long for $10 guys it's 2 pounds it's crazy how right a deal this is so then what I did is I just put it back in the original container that it came in and I popped some aluminum foil on it put it in the fridge and I kept taking it out and reheating it for different recipes throughout the week we made pizzas with this we made chocolate this it was amazing but I need to make my buffalo sauce from the southern keto cookbook I have made this on meal prep before one stick of butter one cup of red hot sauce that is it and I need it for this recipe pulled pork buffalo dip for two oMG y'all this recipe I've made before and I forget how good it is all the time it is so delicious and so simple y'all could definitely make a big batch of this for a party I highly recommend so I'm going to go ahead and make my sauce for that recipe so I'm just melting my stick of butter adding my cup of hot sauce stir it around till it's all incorporated and melted together nicely and then I like to add a little bit of spice to mine so I'm gonna be adding some black pepper to mine you can just leave it as is if you don't like spice but I find that this hot sauce isn't that spicy anyway I'm gonna let cool down and now I'm making my pulled pork tip for two so I'm gonna need the mini my pulled pork I need some cream cheese I'm gonna need some hot sauce here definitely buy that cookbook guys it's always linked down below she's amazing and I'm stirring that up and that's pretty much it so that's what it looks like after you start all that together then I'm gonna put any of my excess hot sauce in this container also from the Dollar Tree and leave it in the fridge guys because I can add this to wings I can add this to anything that I want later and I don't have to make a new batch this last four weeks upon in as well if you put it in the fridge so definitely recommend that too so then what I'm gonna do now is I'm going divide my pulled-pork dip into these containers from Amazon they're divided glass containers for lunch they're amazing and add some shredded cheese on top and then I'm gonna put them in the oven and I'm going to cook and let it bake and you guys look at this look at that cheese look at that bubble this stuff is amazing this was like such a treat for lunch at work and this is great for parties like I said and very macro friendly now we're going into making some jalapeno poppers I have not made these before I'm gonna be making them in the airfryer something else that is super simple to make again for a gathering a lot of this stuff from the meal prep today y'all think about football season coming up ahead for Tito because a lot of it is like football kitto friendly I didn't even realize when I was putting like this meal prep meal plan together after the fact I was like wow this is really good for football season note to self for the Saints whoo-whoo-whoo NAT so I'm gonna go ahead and cut my bell peppers ID seeded all the knob bell peppers jalapeno peppers and then I've got my cream cheese in there that is a third of a cup and then I'm gonna go in with two tablespoons of bacon pieces versus wrapping them in bacon just because it saves an extra step then I'm gonna go in with some Cajun spice because y'all know I like the spicy and give it a nice stir until my cream cheese is all married with all the flavors there I'm then gonna take my cream cheese mixture and I'm going to fill up my jalapenos and just making sure that they're filled up to the very top I wanted to make sure that I didn't have any that was not filled up actually one jalapeno was not used because I didn't have enough cream cheese so that was note to self before next time so I'm putting them in the airfryer now and we are gonna go in the air fryer for 370 degrees for about 15 minutes I like mine to be really cooked and not have a crunch so if you want a crunch don't cook them that long because these were perfect for me as far as being very very tender in the airfryer delicious y'all macros will be listed down below so I'm putting those on the side of my pulled pork tip for two and that was about I think it was like six net carbs for the entire lunch there and my excess jalapeno poppers we are eating on for the weekend so there it all goes in the fridge we're ready for the week I love seeing a full fridge of food for the week and I don't have to do anything now we're going in with our kid okay so you'll know we do this every single week for and mainly for Trey so I will link that down in the description box and in the I cards above on how to make it super simple and if you've been watching these meal prep videos every week you don't even need to watch the real video I'm sure you know how to make it by then and look at this guys it is so delicious we like to dip it with pork rinds and cucumbers but Trey eats it with his different tortilla chips and he absolutely loves it and hates when he's out so he loves meal prep Sunday because he knows this is coming and he is right up my butt which I'll don't see every time I'm making this heat okay so he is right by my side watching me like a hawk now we're gonna go in with our Quito enchiladas I just posted this on my recipes videos that I post on Fridays every single week so instead of going through all the details I'm just gonna link that video down below as well and then the I cards above you can definitely go and check it out it's super easy a lot of people were giving me flack in the video saying that this sounded disgusting and that you know Quito was going to extreme but guys I don't know about y'all but I would rather eat this because I'm getting the same effect first is using five net carbs on a low carb tortilla and it's got questionable ingredients so I went ahead and prep these for the week guys and I added a chicken sausage from Costco and then we melted it in the microwave so good so delicious and a very low carb delicious high-protein option for lunch again where you just stocking up that fridge ah and I am loving it [Music] break time and mommy's going in with a cherry cola Ziva because it's got caffeine and we needed to get through this meal prep now we're going in with the recipe that most of you have all been waiting for this is Dada keto ladies original chocolate cake recipe that I tweaked to make wedding cake version and on Instagram you'll ask me all the time with the recipe so the ingredients and the written out directions will be in the description box down below for y'all I normally don't do that but I am because y'all asked all the time and it will just be really convenient for y'all to always come back to this video and find it so the first thing I'm gonna do is crack four eggs into a huge bowl these bowls I just got from Amazon y'all and went a little Amazon crazy with housewares stuff and these bowls are life because they also have a non-skid thing I just added some oil and I'm just gonna let you know she adds vegetable oil and I added as well so if that triggers you on keto use avocado oil whatever but I don't mind using 1/4 of a cup of something like that it makes these cupcakes so moist guys so I highly recommend now I'm going in with my dry it's a mixture of coconut flour and almond flour and pure or any type of granular non sugar substitute that you have and also some baking powder so then I'm gonna go ahead and mix and whisk all this up and I'm also gonna be adding some specific vanilla flavoring so a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and also one and a half teaspoons of almond extract to the cake batter that she doesn't as she usually adds stuff for a chocolate cake now I'm also going to head and divide 2 tablespoons per cupcake and also got this really good like cool like cookie thing from Amazon that makes that so easy - I'm telling y'all when Amazon crazy y'all can't help it they had such cool gadgets for meal prepping and then 15 minutes for 350 degrees let them cool look how beautiful these look they are so moist so fluffy perfect consistency y'all definitely check that recipe down below in the description box now I'm gonna make my frosting so it is a block of cream cheese also fourth of a cup of butter which I don't know why I didn't show y'all and I'm going to go ahead and cream that together and then now I'm going in with a 1/2 a cup of my powdered sugar substitute and then I'm gonna go in with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of almond extract to make it taste spot-on wedding cake I could just eat all this icing right out of the bowl oh my gosh it's so good y'all I'm tellin you if you like wedding cake this is gonna get your wedding cake fix a lot of y'all have already made it and really love it but if you haven't please please check it out [Music] now we're gonna frost these beauties so y'all know this is my favorite part of baking is so therapeutic to me I love just spending time is only now than frosting cupcakes but we're frosting them all and then I've got these awesome sugar-free sprinkles from stopa oh my gosh all Trey and Waylon love these so I made a couple of them for the boys with sprinkles because I don't know about y'all but Trey will eat anything and I mean anything if it's got a sprinkle on it so thank goodness for these sugar free sprinkles because they have saved me with Trey trying some new things and this is the final product y'all delicious we ate all these all week and they were so nice too net carbs per cupcake if you're wondering again everything will be down below that you need as far as how to make them in the macros next thing we are making our sloppy joes these are from the southern keto cookbook I've made these a million times they taste just like manwich but elevated and you're making it homemade nothing from a can so delicious so I'm gonna be using two pounds of ground meat we're also gonna need some type of sweetener I love dela canto some wishes sheer sauce some tomato paste mustard green peppers onions garlic and some beef broth it couldn't be easier and simpler either guys really simple ingredients so you're gonna brown up your ground meat first and then we're gonna go ahead and put in some of the chopped onion and the green bell pepper I love using frozen because again it saves me a step and you get all the flavors without all the hassle now we're gonna go in with some garlic I'm heavy-handed on it and the pepper as well brown up your ground meat and then I drained mine and then I'm going in with this sento tomato paste I find that tomato paste is higher in carbs so that's what you're really getting your carbs from here is this tomato paste and not really much of anything else going in with my beef broth as well then we're going to give it a good stir and we're gonna let this simmer for about 20 minutes until all that comes together and looks beautiful like you see here now I'm going to go in with my sweetener that's milah can't tell monk fruit sweetener my wishes sheer sauce and then I'm also going to go in with my mustard love the mustard it gives it a nice over here and then give that a good stir let all those flavors marry and you are good to go with your sloppy joes for the week so we actually made cha full bowl y'all I will link my chocolate bowl maker down below and made Chavo sloppy joes OMG let me tell you a new favorite of ours the hub's was obsessed and we I loved it too oh my gosh I just can't wait to make this again so I'm just putting this in a pyrex dish and I'm gonna put it in the fridge for the entire week and bust it out whenever we want to make one of those sloppy joe chocolate bowls they were delicious speaking of chocolate truffles now we are going in with sweet Charles with my little mini Chava everything will be linked down below guys if you have not gotten any of these keto staples in your life this one by - and the bowl one is by - - I highly recommend because they do not stick I have some other ones that stick like crazy so chop wills y'all for a big batch I'm going in with 1 cup of cheese I'm gonna be using mozzarella today since we're going with sweet and then you're gonna need 2 eggs that is it then you add anything else you want to make it your own ok so you can add whatever spices you want you can add any flavorings if you want to add some skinny syrups whatever you have y'all use it so I'm going in with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and then I went heavy-handed with the cinnamon I think I would go with a little bit more of the vanilla or maybe use some Jordans because I couldn't taste that sweet note - too much but the vanilla I mean the cinnamon was a nice treat in there now as you can see I'm just gonna put it on my waffle maker to where it covers it you don't want to overfill them because it will overrun and it'll make a hot mess so this is what it looks like guys so delicious and what I did every morning as I pop these in the airfryer for about five minutes and it made them so nice and crispy I learned that tip from keto lady as well and it just really made them nice and didn't feel like they were soggy or anything so if you want to batch prep these and freeze them highly recommend so I'm gonna go in with my eggs on my divider containers here and I put some everything from the bagel seasoning and they're from Trader Joe's and then I'm gonna add two Chavez to each of these as well so we're having sweet chapels and eggs and now I'm gonna add some of my favorite maple van by chalk zero oh my gosh it's so good and I just added a tablespoon there and I dunked my chocolate in there on the way to work oh my gosh such a nice treat and we'll definitely make that again I also went

comments down below if you're going to take any of these ideas and use them for your meal prep this week I always love to know what y'all are meal prepping down below and definitely go and follow kim guys go and watch her video right now I know she's got some great ideas from y'all and inspiration for meal planning and meal prepping as well so definitely go and show her some love and go and leave an avocado emoji on her channel they killed so much for watching y'all have an amazing Sunday and an awesome week coming up ahead I will see you on the next video bye y'all", "GU3RM5eqeho": "Welcome back to my channel :))\nToday I will be making Cream Cheese Garlic Bread. Don't forget to share this video to support me pls. My birthday is coming up soon so remember to subscribe to my channel and share the video to wish me a happy  birthday :)) First is to make the bread. Fill the bowl with 110ml fresh milk, 30g sugar, and 4g dry yeast (not baking powder) Lazy people can just buy dinner rolls/burger buns/Vietnamese baguette and make the sauce Stir well for the sugar and yeast to dissolve I'm only making this because a lot of people requested it, since it's really tiring to make bread in hot weather. It took me 3 nights to finish shooting this video :(( Don't you feel bad for me :(( After the sugar and yeast had dissolved, add 250g bread flour and 3g salt Lastly 1 egg Mix well so the flour can absorb all the liquid You only need to mix until you don't see anymore liquid, like shown in the video Then, roughly knead by hand for about 5 minutes. Just use the palm of your hand to pull and fold it over, then just repeat the process and you'll be ok Knead for about 5 minutes until the dough stops sticking to your hands Transfer to the work surface Add in 20g unsalted butter and continue kneading until the butter is fully incorporated into the dough At this point, it's gonna be messy :)) try to knead for a while and it'll absorb into the dough :)) It looks like a cleaning rag lol :)) After the butter is incorporated in,  continue kneading for about 15 minutes. The method is still the same as before Keep using the palm to stretch the dough and roll back in, rotate it 90 degrees and repeat the method Knead until it won't tear when you stretch it. The moisture content of the dough is quite high so it'll be a bit sticky (just a tiny bit) so pls be patient Shape the dough into a ball and ferment it for 45-60 min or until it doubles in size (depending on the temperature of where  you live) Omg this is so annoying Around my house has empty land with grass, so I'm surrounded by cricket. Do you want to hear the cricket? While waiting, I'll pretend to fall asleep to look cute for the video :)) There're many crickets, but only 1 that makes really loud noises. Its sounds echoed my entire room Yesterday I was determine to go and find it, but darn it. Crickets are so evil. When they hear humans coming, they just shut up like clams. I searched everywhere but couldn't find any. There are also a few a bit further from my house. but they don't really bother me. But since I already took the bug spray with me, I'll just spray for the ones further away, even if I couldn't catch the ones close by They died after I spray, and then I felt bad. I feel sinful :(( But it's their fault for being so loud After the first fermentation, take it out and roughly knead for about 2 minutes Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape them into balls They aren't loud like the normal ones, these darn crickets are extremely loud They crow as if they're right inside my ears like *I'm crowing so your stupid ears can go deaf*. Idk how to describe that feeling I'm a person that prefers complete silence and have to film videos, but their crows take up the entire video After shaping them, proof them for the second time for about 30 minutes until it reaches about 1.5 its original size (since it'll rise even more when baking, don't proof them for too long or it'll smell like yeast) Proof them inside the oven (oven turned off) with a glass of hot water so they won't dry out and keep them warm After proofing, bake them at 180*C for about 15-20 minutes depending on oven. Until it turns golden brown is ok After they're finished baking, put them in the trash, oh wait no :)) Trash them and make the cream cheese and garlic sauce For the cream cheese mixture, use 200g cream cheese (found at any baking supply stores) Cream cheese must be room temp and use a spatula to make them smooth When it's completely smooth, add in 30g sugar. Then mix for the sugar to dissolve These darn crickets don't just stay around my house, but they even invaded my house. Last night I was so angry because they kept crowing But then there's one that has the gut to sneak inside my house. It crawled under the door of my bathroom and crowed like it had never done it. OMG, I was so angry and grabbed the bug spray I continuously sprayed the gaps in my door and that darn cricket got silent immediately. It came out vigorously resisting, making lots of bubbles omg the feeling of that moment was extreme satisfaction. I was happy to death Oh yea, when the sugar had dissolve, add 50g whipping cream (you can replace it with milk) Whisk so they can combine. Then put the mixture into a piping bag for later use A bit later, I went to the bathroom to wash my face and saw its corpse. I felt so sinful and deeply regretted it :)) When there is something like roach, worm, bugs, etc, came into my house or room, I would just take it and put it out of the house. I never dared to kill them :))))) I'm scared of having sins :)) I only use violent when they do something really bad :)) It's hard to deal with me when I'm angry I'm going to pray for the 2 crickets I accidentally killed yesterday. Please forgive me. I will keep this feeling into my heart forever, so please don't make \"things\" harder for me :)) Next is the garlic butter sauce. Everyone, just forget the little crickets :)) Melt 130g unsalted butter (after leaving them at room temp) Add in 50g finely minced garlic and 30g condensed milk Crack into the bowl 1 whole egg Add in 20g honey, just replace with sugar if you don't have honey Last is 3g marijuana, oh wait I mean parsley. Dry or fresh is ok Add in a bit more if using fresh, or you can dehydrate them at 120 degrees for about 15 mins Whisk until the mixture is combined and kinds of thickens :)) Like this is perfect, not too thick and not too runny After the bread is chilled at room temp, you can just leave it out without wrapping them. When it comes in contact with air, it will hardens up and when you drizzle the sauce on and bake it again, the crust will be crispy. One roll will feed 1 person. Cut into 6 will look the best, 8 is too much and looks ugly Then, take out the piping bag filled with the cream cheese mixture that we prepared earlier Pipe in the middle of each. Remember that this recipe for cream cheese and garlic is enough for 4 breads Don't pipe too much, it'll be overwhelming. But it won't be satisfying with too little :))) Just enough After piping the filling, pour over the garlic sauce of bread You can directly dip the bread into the sauce. But since I'm filming this, I have to drizzle the sauce otherwise it'll look messy Make sure to spread eventually to every side of the bread The bread won't be too wet, but just absorb in enough Ohhh, looking at it again makes me crave it. Tomorrow I'll make another batch for my family to eat :))) The garlic and herbs can be adjusted to your liking. But don't put in too little, as these 2 are the main ingredients of the distinct flavor of this bread After drizzling the sauce, immediately bake again at 160* for 10 minutes (remember to preheat oven). It's feels satisfying to watch the bread inside the oven The best time to eat this is when the bread is still warm It looks soooooooo good. Listen to the sound :)) omg the crust is so crispy and melts inside your mouth I swear I could already smell it when it was still baking. Obviously garlic butter can make a lot of dishes and is well-liked. But I have to say, this bread is super DELICIOUS. The outside is crispy, while the inside is moist, absorbed the sauce. It's also super light. omg I wanna faint Oh, for most of my videos, I only let my cat smell the food, not eat it. I already read and researched the food that aren't good for cats, so don't worry. I saw a lot of you commented so I'll just say it here It's almost my birthday, so remember to subscribe and share my video to support me, pls everyday :))) Comment down below what you want me to make. Thank you everyone so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Bai baiiiiiiiiii", "c3nc41ffU94": "check this meal out this is such a quick and easy Bangladeshi keto friendly meal that you can make for dinner lunch or even breakfast within just about one hours time so it's really important to go ahead and prep things ahead of time and have all your ingredients out it just makes things go quicker and smoother and faster for you especially when you're making multiple items here I have about four onions that I went ahead and chopped ahead of time I have a few coriander cilantro that I went ahead and chopped up as well um this is mainly for garnishing so you don't need too much I also have few chili peppers I have about six that I left whole and then I have about six but I went ahead and flipped the top too this just gives a really nice flavor when you're cooking and then I have about two chili peppers I went ahead chopped up into little pieces I went to the grocery store up Wegmans as a kid seat and I got flounder filet know you can pick any fish you want it could be Bangladeshi fish anything you want however you want prepared the grocery store the American ones it's just easier because they prep everything for you so I have nothing else to do I got this blend of vegetables so I'm going to use they're frozen and the spinach that I'm going to use that cube frozen as well for the vegetables there's carrots in it I know carrots are not that kilo for me but it's okay it's only a little bit it doesn't hurt and then I have shrimp that I'm going to cut into little pieces now these frozen items it just helps to have them because things go quicker doing absolutely fresh items can take some time so we want to do things fast it's easier to use item this way from the grocery store now what I'm doing now is I'm going to start with Nikki the spinach with shrimp so I'm putting in some olive oil and then I'm going to put like a little dab of mustard oil using the mustard oil is completely optional you don't have to I just like the hint of the flavor it gives some isn't it not too tough to see the oil is high enough I'm going to just throw in a small piece of onion on the oil and if you see it starts to bubble around that means it's ready to go it's hot enough and you want to go ahead and put in all your onions up this time I'm putting in about a half a cup of onions into the oil and I'm gonna go ahead and cook this until it gets soft and a little [Music] once your onions are good to go what I like to do is I like to pile them all together make that smaller amount for the spices I'm gonna add in this I feel like it helps to not let any of the oil splatter because I do add a little bit of oil so the spices don't burn so I go ahead and put all the spices that I use on top of the onions and then I'm gonna add about a quarter cup of water on top of the spices and then go ahead and just mix this all up on the pan this way it keeps it from splattering all over the place you don't have to put your heat down and I'm clicking at a medium to medium-high heat right now and it just keeps things cleaner while you're cooking so much you saute that for like a minute or two you want to go ahead and add in your chopped shrimp and you want to go ahead and I'll cook this for a good maybe 3-4 minutes just about until your shrimp eyes start to turn color [Music] so now once you're ready you want to go ahead and add in your spinach and the best part about buying these frozen spinach is that they are already prepped they are cut clean for you ready to go so that also helps it equip fast as well [Music] for about five or six minutes this is now done and ready to be served now quickly moving on to our next item I'm using the same pan I just quickly rinsed it and wiped it down and we're going to do la Brownell which is just a mix of veggie item and typically labra has a variation of different vegetables I refuse to make this fast and quick I bought a frozen pot it does have some carrots in it which is okay to have a little bit carrots it doesn't really hurt you but you can always pick them out or you know by a different frozen pack of vegetables or even fresh veggies however you want to do it the frozen pack makes it quicker and then what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I put in about three tablespoons of oil and a dab of mustard oil for flavoring right now I just put in 1 bay leaf 1 small piece of cinnamon about 3 cardamoms and 2 pieces of dried chili once I see the oil starts to bubble around this I'm going to go ahead and add in about 1/2 a cup of onions [Music] once the onions went ahead and got softer and turned slightly almond and color again I like to go ahead and gather them up right before I put my spices in and then add a little bit of water on top of the spices just to make sure the oil doesn't splatter and my spices don't burn off you want to go ahead and add in your quarter cup of water now and then give this a good mix for about three to four minutes you want to then go ahead and add in your vegetables at this time again you can use any vegetables you like I have this California blend pot I got from Wegmans it's about 1 pound or 16 ounces and again using these frozen vegetables just makes the process so much faster because they're already prepped and cleaned for you I'm gonna go ahead and give this a good mix for about a minute or two and then you want to go ahead and add in about 4 green chilies give it a good mix again and then we're going to go ahead and add in about a cup of water mix that again and then we're gonna cover this for about 15 to 20 minutes while the veggies are on the stove I'm gonna go ahead and do my egg omelet so what I'm gonna do now is go ahead and crack four eggs into a bowl and then I'm gonna whisk them [Music] that's the eggs I'm gonna go ahead and add in about a quarter teaspoon of salt a little more than a quarter teaspoon of turmeric powder I'm gonna add in the chopped chilies ahead and some coriander and I'm gonna add in some of the chopped onions that I have as well [Music] once everything is in you just want to give this a good mix and then it's ready to be fried on I'm putting in about a good maybe three to four tablespoons of olive oil and then I'm just gonna go ahead and wait for the stewed become hot and then once my oil is hot I'm just gonna go ahead and pour in all my eggs a good way to test if the oil is hot just put a little drop of the egg mixture into your oil if you see it bubbles up like this then it's ready to go so now I'm pouring in my egg mixture and I'm going to just let this cook up and I know looks like a lot of oil but that will is about to disappear just wait and then once this is ready I'm gonna try my very best to go ahead and flip this whole not broken and then go ahead and cook the other side and then it should be ready to go [Music] then go ahead and put this on the side for about in one to two minutes the whole thing probably takes about five minutes if anything was and then you want to go ahead and transfer it to a plate and this is ready to be served [Music] now finally going back to our vegetables you can now see that the water has pretty much dried up the vegetables are a lot softer and I'm just kind of breaking some of the pieces of the vegetables to make them a little smaller because it is supposed to be a really soft and texture and then I'm gonna go ahead and add in some coriander the chocolates that I had I'm gonna just mix this in and then this is ready to be served now finally you're getting to our fish fry so this is the fish I got its flounder and it's already prepped for me by all means pick any fish you want to get it doesn't have to be a fillet like this it could be a whole fish it could be cut up it could be steak pieces butterfly however you like it to be this is what I just picked up from the grocery store so I'm just gonna use this and what I'm gonna do now is go ahead and add in all the spices for this I'm gonna mix this up together and it's gonna look like a little paste of spices and this is what I'm gonna use to rub on the fish it's gonna be like a marinade and I'm just going to rub it all over the fish [Music] for frying the fish I'm going to use straight mustard oil on adding about 3 to 4 tablespoons and this is because it's more of an authentic way of frying fish is using mustard oil and it gives it a great flavor so once the oil is hot enough I'm gonna go ahead and add in the fish pieces one by one and then I'm going to pan sear this for about 5 minutes on each side on a medium heat 5 minutes on each side I went ahead and turned the stove off I'm gonna now transfer this to the plate and it's ready to be served you can eat this with your kiddo rooty look for the link above so you can go ahead and find the video to go ahead and make that and then look at this plate this is such an awesome a typical Bangladeshi quick and easy meal to make for any key to abolish [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "jCTx3CWvjzI": "Welcome all! Papa G here. Today I present my Sticky, Garlic Fire Chicken.   Just as the name suggests,  this recipe features a lot of garlic and a little sweetened heat to bring\nan otherwise boring piece of chicken, to a whole new low carb flavor level. Let's get started. We\u2019ll begin with our marinade  and mix together in a Ziploc bag, a brown sugar substitute some rice vinegar salt ground black pepper smoked paprika some Worcestershire sauce a little liquid smoke some spicy chili paste and just a little zero sugar ketchup. We'll finish with a lot of minced garlic about 4 tablespoons. I know some of you prefer chopping your own, but with this much, I find it easier just to use the jarred variety. Seal the bag and mix thoroughly to combine,  then set aside. Prep our chicken by slicing two boneless,\nskinless chicken breasts in half. Add the chicken to the marinade and mix to coat. Place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours to overnight. The longer the better. Remove the chicken from the marinade and wipe off as much of the garlic as possible.  Reserve the marinade as we\u2019ll be using it later on. Add about two tablespoons of oil to a\nsaut\u00e9 pan on medium high heat.  Add the chicken and let fry, undisturbed\n for between 3 to 4 minutes, depending upon the thickness. Flip, and repeat. Remove the chicken to a plate to rest Now reduce the heat to medium and deglaze\nthe pan by adding the marinade.   You\u2019ll see the liquid becoming a bit darker as it picks\nup all the flavor from our chicken we fried.   Let come to a boil for a minute Now add two tablespoons of unsalted butter  and mix to combine. Return the chicken to the pan.  Flip several times to coat the chicken as\nit's heated through. Plate warm and enjoy! Deeelicious! There you have it folks!   My low carb Garlic Fire Chicken recipe. Chicken, garlic and spice,  at a whole new level of flavor.   I hope you enjoyed this video.

Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time!", "ZsvPUezEHh4": "this video covers an entire year in the process of growing garlic from putting the cloves in the ground to harvest to saving new cloves and starting the whole process over again hi i'm gardner scott i'm a master gardener and i discuss everything gardening so that you can become a better gardener today let me show you how to grow garlic today i'm going to harvest my garlic the process began nine months ago and i'm going to show you every step in the process so let's go ahead and jump back nine months hi i'm gardner scott and today is one of my most favorite days of the year it's the day i plant garlic for me it's the beginning of october which is perfect for my zone five garden garlic takes eight to nine months to grow from putting the clove in the ground to harvesting the bulb and i'll be showing you that entire process you should grow garlic in a spot that gets at least six hours of sun each day and the more the better the soil should be as rich as possible and as loose as possible you really don't want a compacted soil because the individual garlic cloves as they grow into bulbs need to expand so a looser soil will allow those cloves to expand much easier i'm going to plant garlic throughout this entire bed 12 different varieties and much of it will be used next october for the following year's plants but a lot of it's also going to be used in my kitchen to get the best results i like to lay out the garlic in a grid pattern six inches apart from every individual clove that's about 15 centimeters so i begin by putting my plant tags six inches apart to identify where the rows are going to be and then as i lay out the individual cloves i'll place them six inches apart as i get ready to plant i'll break apart the bulb to release the individual cloves inside and i'll just continue separating these bulbs into individual cloves for planting first because i do like to have everything spread out so i'll just go down the line and get the cloves ready to go the number of cloves will vary by the different types of garlic at this point i'll just separate out the cloves and that'll give me an idea of how many i'll have to plant in each row it looks like i got six from this matechie the matechi is a hardneck variety of garlic this inch liam red is a soft neck and i've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven 12 cloves from this single bulb as i get ready to lay the cloves out for putting them in their final hole i want to pick the best cloves for planting now back to this matechi it's a hard neck and all of the clothes are basically the same size so i'll plant all of these but with this enchiliam red i get cloves of different sizes based on where they are in the bulb so i'll try to focus on these bigger cloves for planting and if i don't need them i'll save these smaller cloves to actually use in the kitchen these bigger bulbs will grow into a much bigger and better bulb next year if you come across any cloves that are really damaged or look like they're starting to rot or maybe they're very dried out well don't even attempt to plant these clothes they're best just to throw in the compost pile if you come across any that look like they have little eggs inside maybe little spider web looking filaments don't even throw these in the compost pile these go into the trash you don't want to introduce any pests into next year's garlic crop as i lay out the cloves i'll actually stagger the rows so when i start a new row i'll make sure that the cloves actually run about at the halfway point between the previous clove spacing you want to bury the cloves at least twice as deep as the clove is tall so for a clove that is one and a half inches or about four centimeters you want to bury it in a hole that's three inches deep or about seven and a half centimeters deep in a bed like this where i have everything precisely measured i will have some cloves left over those little ones that i don't think will grow into very good plants will definitely go into the kitchen to be used for cooking but i do have some robust cloves that can grow into great plants and i'll actually spread them throughout the garden they can be a great aid to you and your pest control because garlic growing alongside many other plants can actually deter some of the pests that you're trying to get rid of already there are three basic methods that i use to plant these cloves when you look at the clove you'll notice one of the tips is definitely flat and one of the tips is definitely pointed it's like a little rocket ship you want the flat piece to be down and you want this pointy piece to be up one way to plant the cloves if you've got a lot in a row is to dig a trench i like to use a trowel that's got measurements on it just to be sure that i'm getting the proper depth so i'll dig the trench down to the point where i want the clove base to be and then when it comes time i just lay the clothes into the trench and then cover up the clothes and this row is now planted the row method is pretty effective if you're planting a border of garlic or putting them in some other section of your yard but for a bed like this where i want everything specifically spaced it doesn't work as well particularly as you start going into the middle of the bed because the rows create soil going out in all directions so i prefer one of the other two methods when i plant like this for precision and this is why i like to use a trowel with measurements i can push the trowel into the soil to the proper depth just pull it aside and then stick the clove in the bottom of that hole and i can just go down the row making sure each of these clothes is perfectly spaced the third method is to make holes ahead of time just punch a grid of holes into the soil drop the clove and cover it up and you'll be ready to go and i used to do that using round wooden pieces wooden dowels that were measured to the proper depth and i would just poke a hole and then drop the cloves in but i started to be a little concerned about soil compaction if i'm pushing that piece of wood into the ground well then it's compacting as i push it in and right where the roots are growing that's going to be the most compacted soil in that hole so since then i've developed this method which is to use a hollow piece this is pvc it's used in irrigation like in a sprinkler system for a lawn and what i'll do is push this into the ground to the proper depth and when i pull it out i'm usually left with a plug of soil inside this hollow piece and i can just knock it out and then i can place the clove into this hole that i've dug and cover it up and for me this works pretty well if the soil is mostly moist you can just do your series of holes and be all ready to go to drop your clothes in because i've grown a lot of garlic over the years and i've done this quite a bit what i find works best for me is to just dig a hole drop in the clove dig a hole drop in the clove and just continue on always being sure to keep the pointy side up and because i've got the measurements on the trowel i can make sure that i'm going down to the exact depth that i'm looking for and this works pretty well i can be pretty fast with this but you can be free to choose whichever method you like best i'm also growing elephant garlic now it's not technically a garlic it's a leek but it tastes like garlic and looks like garlic and it gets quite large this is a single clove which is about as big as some of the other bulbs before i broke them apart because this is bigger it needs to be planted deeper twice the height we also need to give more room for the bulb to develop so i'm spacing this row of elephant garlic at least eight inches away from the other rows and i'm hoping to get some nice robust bulbs of elephant garlic with everything planted now we take the time to water it in very well really nice deep watering with the bed well watered now it's time to add a thick layer of mulch now i like to use straw you could easily use dried grass dried leaves even small wood chips you want to put some protection on the soil the garlic is actually going to start putting out roots pretty quickly if we keep this bed watered even if it's cold outside even if it's snowy the roots will continue to grow and this mulch just really helps keep the temperatures warm as possible as long as possible it also helps protect it over the winter because this garlic is going to be in the ground for nine months in the spring when the weather warms up it's going to pop back into that growth cycle it's strong enough to punch up through all of this mulch which is perfectly fine that's why i like a lighter mulch to make it easier and in the spring this is also like a blanket it helps keep the soil warmer so that that garlic can continue to grow and to help keep the mulch in place i'll give it another really thorough watering and this will help the mulch settle down onto the soil the garlic's in the ground and i'll treat it just like any other seed i'll continue to water to keep the soil evenly moist and it won't be long before those little cloves start sending out roots and the roots will grow until the soil is frozen so i need to make sure that as long as the days are warm i'm out here watering periodically i'll come out and i'll stick my finger into the bed if it's excessively dry even during winter i'll add some water because i don't want those cloves drying out they'll go dormant over the winter but i don't want them to desiccate so winter watering may be necessary if i don't get a lot of snow in the spring i'll be looking for the new green growth as soon as the soil thaws out the garlic's going to pop up in the spring just keep watering the garlic like you would any other plant add additional mulch as necessary to keep the soil covered and the plants will grow fine and you'll start to notice on the hardneck varieties that scapes will develop these are the little vertical curly cues that are completely edible very tasty i'm not trying to show off but this is exactly what your garlic should look like it should be tall dark green and the scapes should start developing on these hard neck varieties this curly cue that develops on the hard neck starts off with a nice big curve but it'll straighten up as it grows that straight scape is a good indication that the plant is getting close to harvest the garlic plants will tell you when it's time to harvest you'll start seeing browning leaves at the base of the plant the hard neck varieties will stay erect but you'll notice three four five then six leaves begin to brown and dry that's a really good indication that it's time to harvest the hardneck varieties also will have their scapes grow vertically now i do encourage that you cut the scapes when they're young when they're still in that curly shape because they're delicious and there are a number of ways you can eat them but i allowed these plants to go vertically so that you could see what they look like and also so that i can show you some pictures of what the garlic seed actually looks like and you can save this seed and plant it if you leave the garlic in the ground and allow some of the seeds to develop the soft neck varieties of garlic will also brown but those plants will typically begin to fall over they won't stay erect in either case what you're looking for is what looks like the plants dying when you see the drying of the leaves it's often a good idea to go ahead and just do a test go ahead and dig up a few of the bulbs to see how they're developing and this actually looks pretty good the bulb's not huge that's okay but it's intact and it looks like it's ready to harvest leaves turning brown on the garlic plants tell us that it's getting close because each of those dried leaves correspond to a layer of the protective covering over the individual clothes you know when you cut the bulb and that papery outer shell is something that you pull off well that papery outer shell corresponds to each of these leaves and we want it to be intact around the cloves it's protection that's why we're waiting until the point that we've guessed the maturity of the bulb by looking at the leaves now this test dig shows us that in this case yes the bulb is mature the cloves are being protected and we're very close to harvest so the next step is to actually leave the garlic in the ground for a few days and stop watering because we want this outer shell to begin to harden to protect the bulb if we harvest everything when everything is still wet you run the risk of actually tearing or breaking this outer shell and your bulbs won't store as long as they might otherwise be able to so let the ground dry out a little bit before you proceed with the rest of the harvest and one way to harvest pretty efficiently is with a garden fork and i'll just place this in the soil and leverage out all of those garlic bulbs you can do this with a shovel or a spade but i find the fork to be very effective and so what i do is loosen the soil and then reach down and pull out the individual bulbs you really don't want to grab and pull because you can pull the stock away from the plant so once the soil is loosened it becomes really easy to harvest and now i'll just reach down and lay all of these bulbs as i continue the harvest i find the garlic fork most efficient if you're growing all the same type of garlic now i've got 12 different varieties here and i'm planning on saving some of the clothes to replant for next year's garden and i don't want to get them all mixed up by just coming in with a fork or a spade and digging up all the bulbs so i'm going to use a trowel and now even though it takes longer i'm going to go through and dig up each of these bulbs individually just so i can keep track of which variety is which as you dig up the cloves go ahead and try to brush off as much of the soil as you can but you don't want to be too rough on the individual bulb because remember this protective layer is still relatively soft we want it to dry out so i'm just going to get most of the soil off of the roots and for now this bulb looks clean enough and as you continue to dig up your bulbs just lay them on the surface of your bed the sun will help them dry out giving it that protection it'll also dry out the soil making it easier to brush off if you choose to leave it on the surface be sure that there's no rain in the forecast for a couple days and that's all you need is just two days so that the sun can help cure those outer layers of the garlic that will give it good protection for good long storage i'm going with another option and that's the same basic concept to cure the garlic allow those outer layers to dry but i'm doing it inside so i've just laid all the garlic out on newspaper and gonna wait for about two or three days for the garlic to cure before i clean it any further after two days of sitting upstairs on newspaper i went ahead and cut off the stalks and tried to brush off as much of the dirt as possible then i came downstairs laid it out on newspaper again and i've waited another three days for it to dry some more to finish cleaning it up i set aside some of the garlic in my kitchen and all this it's down here i left all the plant tags so i know which is which and i'll just try to pull off any remaining dirt trim the roots and try to clean up this garlic as good as possible for storage between now and when i plant these cloves back in the ground and here's a trick i learned from my gardening buddy larry to go ahead and write the name of the garlic and permanent marker right on the bulb so now i don't have to worry about these getting mixed up and separated from the plant tag when it comes time to plant i know this is chestnut red and i'm all ready to go and now i'll put the cleaned trimmed labeled garlic in a box along with plant tags that i can reuse put it in a cool dry dark spot for about the next two months until i'm ready to put these back in my garden and start it all over again the garlic will easily store for two to three months between when i label the bulbs to when i put the clothes back in again for next year's crop and during that two to three month time period well i have plenty of time to scope out my garden and figure out where i'm going to plant garlic again i think it's probably going to be this bit i have some squash and cucumbers growing in it now i've been getting some great harvests many more harvests to come but in about a month i'm going to get my first freeze and it's going to kill these plants well when these plants are dead i'll pull them out i'll revitalize the soil add more organic material and then it's ready for planting again it's ready for garlic so you've seen the whole cycle how we can start with cloves get all the way to harvest save our bulbs and then plant all over again so once you find a variety you like or a garlic that does really well in your area well try this start to finish and over again and you'll have garlic for as long as you have a garden i hope you learned something in this video and if you did well then consider subscribing to the gardener scott channel if

touch this okay so one of ready peel and one you keep it aside so in the same time the scallop we defrost and we wash okay remember to tap it dry from a tissue paper kitchen towel paper okay you do not want the the scallop to have too much moist because scallop is very moist so when it's too much moist it will come out a lot of water in onto the food so you have to let it dry and be careful with the tissue that was stuck there so you just remember that okay make sure the scallop is dry okay and wash and dry okay after you wash and dry the salt and pepper i give it to you okay for the scallop you just need to pinch a little just put on top okay just a little not too much okay just a little pinch okay that's all see pinch of salt and pepper the next step after straining off the coke pasta

west coast youtube review featuring calya extracts rosin uh today's product we're gonna be reviewing the ice water extract it's a sun cake rosin your boy justin is back so we're gonna dive right in one dab each we'll talk about it two dabs four out of ten saying yeah yeah let's do it all right let's dive into at least some of the percentages real quick 68.5 on the thc 77.08 percent on the thca cbd 0.32 and cannabinoids total 77.08 so in terms of rosin is it the most potent rosin we've ever dabbed no it's not but no but sun cake right i have a feeling this is going to be cakey earthy piney maybe a little spicy hopefully yes yes and this is the i know the exact cross this is sunset sherbert crossed with ice cream cake something so right off the bat it's like an indica dominant height not a wedding cake okay cool you know and i feel i feel i feel this is gonna provide like a real nice that's some good color y'all hi that's my producer got that like snotty hash color right for sure this this definitely has a better color than the other one yeah right this just gives that look of like wow this is six star a grade what is the what's the um you check that out i mean i'll give you a little you know just so you can see it it doesn't say the uh the use the 70 or whatever yeah it should if this sticker might have uh oh it says it on the lid so you to 120 [Music] all right i'm excited man again i believe i've dabbed italia with you a couple times maybe two or three times at this point i i can't sit here and honestly say that i can name one strain or remember one and so at this point you know i'd really like to give these ones a fair shot and the attention that they deserve because i think you know calgary does get recommended as one of the best rosin brands in the state of california yeah when i go places so they definitely have the most exclusive drops uh it's something that's hard to acquire like it was hard to acquire that sweet and sour as well as this sun cake because uh it just sells out very quickly in the shops so now make sure you line it up this time there you go you see you see saw the first time it was showing you a lower number but once you get in the middle diameter of the banger gave you a proper reading all righty turf timer no octave no technology errors on this go we are doing it the right way all right also this is a highly educated quartz banger both of them are the same same thickness same everything so yeah this is the way the dad works on instagram italiax.com i like it i like it fresh frozen it says nothing but fresh frozen they're uh you know tell you that's why they call it it's ice water extract because it's coming from fresh frozen interesting interesting get your dad ready oh no [Music] you take dabs at whatever temperature you take that which is traditionally hot in my experience so we both have these turf timers set we both have these two timers set for 500 degrees okay once it hits 500 like to kind of let it sit till like 480 470 and then go in for the dab what is that that's usually how you get the nicest milk this is sun cake sunset sherbet times ice cream cake you dropped a video thank you sir you're gonna go no it's too hot still all right see i'm saying you take harder grabs harder sometimes when it's a little bit bigger you might you got to go like 20 degrees a little you know that's a nice milk i've been dabbing rosin since you were in diapers that's a nice melt yo look at that oh let me tell you it is delicious that [ __ ] is loud yo i do that [ __ ] [ __ ] smack me in the face oh wow mine still says 490 484 479 475 all right so in terms of the flavor that i'm getting sweet sweet pineness sweet sweet gassy earth and in terms of like the kind of high that i'm experiencing it's it's both energetic and relaxing in terms of the body height right it really does wash over your body and i had you saw me crack my back earlier before this episode oh my goodness wow this is wow took away all the aches that i had because i literally just had so much pain a second ago i had to roll on my back wow gone yo wow what do you think hit me with more than one word on this okay this is this is you know this is more than terpy this is like where you're like you're like trying to figure out like what is that is that vanilla frosting is that is that like a cookie you know but um ice cream cake and sunset sugar you said yeah that's delicious so super super i like the chirping profile if if this was a girl this would be my type um and i definitely go for this one over the sweet and sour because the sweet and sour was you know i think by the name is kind of like hybrid sweet and sour i like sweet this is some cake this is the crust it's it's a different kind of high at the end of the day this is ice cream cake gassy pine sweet gassiness i mean makes you want to go back for more like that we have a second dab to review it out of 10. well my i went like super low in my [ __ ] oh so you still have a second down today all right well [ __ ] okay pass me that torch really yeah you had to see that was the last little bit yeah and that tastes like i'm telling you i get that i get the really nice vanilla ice cream i still have the taste of it all right college yeah i still even need a vanilla ice cream on that side is this the first dab where you don't actually need a second dab or almost like sun cake they should have called this your angel was that angel cake they should have called this [ __ ] like heaven cake vanilla [ __ ] clouds it is sweet tiny gassy the nose on it is wonderful like as soon as you start like that's the word nutmeg i was like what smells that word that's that's not the side of this wow it's literally loud that's what i'm saying it hit when you smell it you're you're like your eyes squint yeah it's impressive i have a score of mine out of ten the second dab is not going to do it you know aside from human error [ __ ] it up so for me my score out of 10 is going to be 9.5 that would that's my score no no you told me what what genetics this is but it needs to say it on there yes and then i need the terpene information on there and that's the last two points for me the last half point point two five each i got you this is a problem that's a perfect product i would i want to dock them for the branding instead but repeatedly over and over people recommend kalyan as one of the best and so am i always at this point it doesn't matter the bartenders don't care that it looks like this they still think it's one of the best so i'm not going to take anything for that right 9.5 for me where you at i'm at 9.5 as well i'm at 9.5 as well i think uh wonderful i think yeah like really you hit it on the t with exactly what you said that if call it if you just provide that little bit of information so it would have been a 10 out of 10. like that yeah this is great you know and the packaging is not even that bright or like poppy but you know once you dip into it i mean you know what you're going to have a box like a cool acid wash box version of this but let's be real let's be real but it has to shout out to colleen because they the collabs they do are actually where they go crazy with the packaging this is actually a collab that's sweet and sour right that's the vesuvio gardens uh yeah yeah that's dope well big thank you guys you know calio you guys do a big shout out appreciate you guys checking in coming in hot at a 9.5 from both of us definitely go check out the sun cake rosin sweet and sour on the previous episode

king of Nuggets no I think that there's a new king in town he's about to have it his way [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys and welcome back to episode 8 of but better the series where we take coveted cold fast foods and junk foods and recreate them at home using classic cooking techniques with the hopes of making it better okay so we're making McDonald's McNuggets it's happening the thing is happening I've already done chick-fil-a Nuggets that was super fun do I think that either of these guys are the king of Nuggets boom that McDonald's McNuggets seem to have some sort of a charm I don't get it we're gonna taste it and it's gonna be great okay so with all that said let's make this shall we it's a time for McDonald's I can't believe I'm doing this this is like a breach of my own morals thank you YouTube we got the back the golden arches have arrived to our home I didn't think that they would break the forefront but they pushed and I opened my palace doors we got the meat nuggies I haven't eaten these in a long time and I'm a little bit scared but we do this for science not really crispy but I haven't had this in so long and get it it really does taste familiar a barbecue sauce that's something good to you not bad but I think we're fitting to have it now before we make our thicky nuggies i'm gonna make a quick barbecue sauce now stay with me here you're gonna need 1 cup or 270 grams of ketchup 1/4 cup are 63 grams of dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon or 7 grams of smoked paprika 1 tablespoon of 10 grams of garlic powder why don't have teaspoons are four grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or 15 grams of Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of Worcestershire sauce okay look I know there's a lot of ingredients ready stay calm stay calm we're almost there one enough tablespoons are 16 grams of cheek young vinegar or Chinese black vinegar three tablespoons are 35 grams of rye whiskey which is optional okay I know it's a lot of ingredients okay just please half a cup per one hundred twenty milliliters of water 3 tablespoons are 35 grams of white distilled vinegar and an optional splash of sheer dashi after that it's really simple just whisk it together bring it up to a simmer and let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes or until it's thick II sticky like this and you've got yourself a beautiful barbecue sauce that's ready for any chicken nugget which speaking of okay so if we're gonna make chicken ugh jeez you're gonna need chicken I broke down this whole chicken just for the Flex but really you're gonna need one and a half pounds of chicken breast and I bought a quarter of a pound of chicken skin all right everybody's like well it's flavor okay cut your chicken breasts into 1-inch cubes and rough chop the chicken skin now look I know this next process is a little scale we okay I'm grinding the meat through a meat grinder but it's just a kitchen and attachment it's like 40 bucks or something like that the link for mine is in the description but if you don't want to do it that way then you can absolutely do it in a food processor just make sure to get it as fine as possible now once all of your meat and skin has been ground place that in a bowl and toss together with two teaspoons or 14 grams of kosher salt 1 teaspoon or 7 grams of granulated sugar and half a teaspoon or 1 gram of MSG yes the right way to make McNuggets oh so that's together until thoroughly combined until it's nice and homogeneous like this then place it in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up or waiting let's set up our fry station fill a heavy-bottomed pot up with enough oil to go up around 2 and a half to 3 inches high but not more than like 60% full according to my research there's a three part parting process first you're gonna make a very thin batter consisting of a quarter cup or 45 grams of cornstarch whisk together with one cup or 240 milliliters of water and that's it next to flour dredge consisting of three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour one heaping tablespoon or 22 grams of kosher salt half a teaspoon or two grams of MSG one teaspoon or three grams of fresh ground white pepper and 1 teaspoon or two grams of celery powder was that together until thoroughly combined lamblia was and pour the new shell 8x8 baking dish and last is some sort of weird tempura batter that consists of half a cup or 75 grams of cornstarch yeah Pat that out really good idea josh nice work 3/4 of a cup 103 grams of all-purpose flour one and a quarter teaspoon or four grams of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon or 1 gram of baking soda but set together until thoroughly combined and one cup of 240 milliliters of chilled water add 2 whisked eggs to that whisk until everything's thoroughly combined and that's your tempura stuff now to make your Nuggets gonna take out your firmed ground chicken you're gonna form them into chicken nugget esque shapes we're a little bit thick but you know how I feel about that 27 sees baby if they're too sticky lightly wet your hands before shaping now in batches first drop them in your thin cornstarch mixture then toss with the flour mixture until thoroughly coated shaking off the excess flour unless dip them in your tempura batter now wait from the tempura batter you're gonna quickly drop them into oil that's been set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit optionally if you want some extra flakiness you can bring them to the surface using a spider and just let your battered hands drip all over the nuggies again that's optional and requires some skill you totally skip that if you want then just let those fry for 5 to 7 minutes in batches or until nice and golden brown remove them and place them on a wire rack to cool and repeat with the rest the next thing you know you got McNuggets at home with a barbecue sauce that will make you sob yourself to sleep these are mine I know and then this is the McDonald's one obviously mine are a little bigger because I like it extra thick too sticky now the McDonald's nugget we're back again it's weird right like it tastes good but I still hate it so I'm gonna go and just taste mine don't pretty quickly the first thing to know the flavors pretty close the msg definitely helped crunching this is much more delicate although there's not much left in this there finally all right so let's taste the sauce oh right so we got there this is my sauce my sausage real good mine is definitely more complex Chiqui nuggie plus the sauce I think all things considered we definitively won but not exactly just by a landslide McDonald nugget I think that they're decent they're not like as bad as I thought they were to be honest but they also are still pretty pretty depressing I guess for this one we'll have it my way do you want know what else will have its way be alright guys and that is it so Mick chicky nuggies in the bag I think we did a wonderful job you know improving something that really isn't already that good is obviously not that hard but this one particularly was challenging I don't know why it just was I felt like the product that we got was a better product but not necessarily in the way that I expected it was still better and the sauce helps a lot yeah this was this is a fun one as an upload and all the but better series I think I'm gonna be uploading one extra but better per month so I was doing - I think I'm gonna start doing three but anyway if you enjoyed this video or you'll incident leave a like subscribe and I will see you [Music] [Music]", "ybLuv7nipEk": "[Music] so so so so [Music] you", "EUjZwcYPlGg": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel and if you're new welcome to my channel my name is dana and i make meal prep videos every single week this week i did something a little bit different for meal prep and i prepped one main uh protein and made all three meals or snacks out of that protein um this really helped cut down on time so i just you're going to kind of see it in the beginning but i just i used my instant pot to cook a bunch of chicken breasts and then i shredded them and then all three recipes used the shredded chicken so like i said this cut down a lot on time it's a really easy way to get a lot of meal prep done all at once so i definitely will be doing it again in the future next week's meal prep i'm going to be uh actually doing a couple's meal prep with jesus and we're gonna show you how we sort of organize meal prep and change a few things in each recipe because our goals are very different so let's get started with this week's meal prep all right so here is the chicken that i made okay i'm gonna start by measuring out the chicken that i need for the buffalo egg bites and i'm gonna do about 350 grams of chicken because this is for both me and jesus and i am um i'm going to add three tablespoons of this sweet baby raise buffalo sauce to the chicken and i'm going to add um two tablespoons of this is supposed to be melted butter it was mostly melted i wasn't gonna wait any longer and then i'm just gonna combine those and i'm gonna do that by just shaking it up the melted butter isn't necessary but it does keep the chicken from getting dry in the egg muffins especially as like you use it throughout the week so i do recommend using this step um it does add a few more calories but really these are low calorie overall so it's gonna be okay so in a separate bowl i'm going to crack six eggs into the bowl and i'm going to add two tablespoons of the buffalo sauce to the eggs and we're gonna add half a tablespoon not half a tablespoon half a teaspoon of salt and pepper i'm just eyeballing that for this and we're gonna add garlic powder as well again it's supposed to be half a teaspoon but just gonna eyeball it so i decided to add um half a cup no a cup of just egg whites liquid egg whites as well just to make this recipe have a little bit more volume to it and egg whites are not going to add a lot of calories so now we're going to combine the egg mixture with our chicken and mix that up and i'm going to spray a 13 by 9 inch pan like i said these are supposed to be egg muffins which is how i made them before but i wanted to see if i could just make this into like an egg bake instead so i'm gonna put this in the oven at 425 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes okay so i'm gonna get started on chopping the veggies for the chicken salad so i'm going to chop up 100 grams of celery again i'm just gonna kind of eyeball this because celery's not really going to change the calories too much the next thing i'm going to chop up are these red grapes i did weigh these out and this is 100 grams of the red grapes and i'm just going to quarter these this recipe also calls for some red onion but i am not a fan of raw onion in anything so i did not include it i have 115 grams of the shredded chicken here and i'm just gonna add my grapes and celery into the bowl and i'm gonna add a hundred grams of this plain non-fat greek yogurt we're gonna season it with some pepper and some garlic powder again the recipe says a quarter of a teaspoon but usually with seasonings i don't always measure and then i'm adding some salt as well so we're going to mix all of these things together to make a quick easy chicken salad this recipe would be really great too if you have one of those rotisserie chickens it could be completely no cook if you have one of those all right so i'm just gonna use the rest of our chicken this is a little over 300 grams i'm adding one can of corn and one can of black beans and i'm just going to kind of mix these around this step isn't necessary i guess to put it in the pan and cook it you could do this all in the bowl but i'm about to season the chicken and i feel like it ends up absorbing the flavors a little bit better when you do put it over at least some heat so i'm gonna add two tablespoons of chili powder half a teaspoon of cumin half a teaspoon of paprika half a teaspoon of garlic powder half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper half a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of oregano half a teaspoon oh those are salt and pepper the one before was onion powder sorry so half a teaspoon of salt and pepper and the previous one was onion powder and then i'm just gonna mix these up again i'm not really cooking the chicken i'm just trying to cook the seasonings into the chicken a little bit by using the heat and here is what it is going to look like um when it's done cooking all right so i'm going to start packing up my bowls again i'm just going to make um the snack bowls the night before so i'm only going to do one for each of us and that's just because it um you know keeps better especially things like this um like the chicken salad will keep better if it's all in one container so i'm just putting two of these scoops this is probably about half a cup total of the chicken salad and then i'm just gonna add some carrots i know that i like put carrots in every snack bowl but it's just a really easy veggie that is easy to eat without anything else and i just really think that you should eat foods that you enjoy and not force yourself to eat things that you don't like just because they're good for you so carrots are just like an easy vegetable that i really enjoy eating and then i'm just going to put a plain rice cake and each of them jesus will get two i did end up because i'm working from home i ended up actually eating this usually on toast instead of the rice cakes um i just liked that a little bit better but it's also hard to bring toast with you if you are going somewhere so the rice cakes are a really good option for that and then i'm just gonna put the rest of the chicken salad in a tupperware and i will serve it out the night before into snack bowls like i said and i'm just gonna pack up the burrito bowl so again i just made this rice in my rice cooker for my bowls i will put half a cup of rice in each for jesus bowls i will put one cup of rice in each and i'm just going to add the chicken mixture again i'm going to add half a cup in each of my bowls and a cup in each of jesus's i did typically eat this with some avocado and greek yogurt maybe a little bit of cheese throughout the week all right here are the finished chicken bowls we each got four that is the buffalo egg bake and then our snack bowls and the leftover chicken salad all right guys that is it for this week's meal prep i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a like and if you want to see more of these

are finally here choc zeros no sugar added baking chips now I know they are called bacon chips but I don't discriminate I don't need to bake them to be able to eat them people have been loving choc zero chocolate for quite a while now and you know now they're releasing chocolate chips changing the game you can add these to your your baked goods or again like I said just you and we have two varieties so we have the the milk chocolate ones on the left which are going to be similar to their their normal milk chocolate bars and on the right we have white chocolate which is kind of rare for them they had white chocolate dipping cups but you know no white chocolate like bars or anything so that's really cool alright let's take a look at the milk chocolate chips first this is six grams of total carbs - five grams of fiber and that's from soluble corn fiber that they use in most of their products for a total of one gram net carb per sixty little chips and that's 14 grams and I'll show you what the chips look like in a bit really that's the biggest thing there's no protein and then the fat is at 6 grams with 3 and a half grams saturated so that again a lot of that is gonna be from the whole milk but more so the cocoa butter now four ingredients we have the milk chocolate which is just unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter and then that whole milk powder that's where probably the one gram of sugar comes from the whole milk powder you got soluble corn fiber to kind of you know for texture for one but also to kind of balance out the sweetness be monk fruit extract that is used as a sweetener you got sunflower lecithin which is an emulsifier and then you got to have that vanilla being over there and that's pretty much it and then now let's take a quick look at the white chocolate very similar one gram of sugar 1 gram net carb but this one has 1 gram of protein so I think there's a little more full milk powder probably but the main ingredient is cocoa butter then you have that soluble corn fiber which accounts for that 6 grams of dietary fiber again home like powder sunflower lecithin all the same stuff as the milk chocolate so the other one just has some cocoa in it all right and this is what those chips look like like normal chocolate chips I'd say they're just regular-sized the white ones look a little bit kind of bigger the actual chips I'm not sure if they're using different machinery or not that shouldn't make much of a difference at all and we also have our handy dandy scales so this is 14 grams this is how much a serving is and I'm gonna dump these out here so you can kind of get a picture and here is that 14 grams of each dumped out so you can kind of get a feel for the size and yeah I mean that little handful there is one gram net carb pretty awesome if you ask me so I just tried some of these the texture is kind of like waxy it's literally remind you of candy corn that you get for Halloween it has a very similar tastes very similar texture not so much from melty but kind of waxy if that makes sense tastes really good and then had a couple of these guys as well you get that similar again wax your texture so not so much like a Hershey kiss but almost kind of like it tastes something exactly like the the candy whoppers but not you know without the crunch right so just the taste of the chocolate it has the end texture is that waxy taste very nice and sweet rather than I would say rich again yeah the the white chocolate ones taste a lot to me like candy corn they don't taste like your Hershey's cookies and cream white chocolate bars so that's just something to note and the milk chocolate ones definitely taste like the the milk chocolate portion of the whoppers candies alright so that was just a super quick look at Chuck zeroes baking chip products I think they go really well on their own kind of adds like something you snack on or I think if you melt them down and add them to desserts that call for them that's a really great piece as well as far as adding them to cookies I'm not as convinced for the milk chocolate ones I think you know maybe they're a little too milky you might want something more chocolatey a little darker and for the white chocolate ones you you know they're they're not like as rich for like maybe a white chocolate macadamia that cookie I think for the white chocolate ones actually you could probably add them to like a trail mix with nuts and they would go pretty well there because they're kind of like you know yogurt chips in a sense but either way you work with what you got to work with and I'm really glad these products exist you know they could be a game-changer for this product category so go out check it out let us know what you think I think these are really two great options", "5rtHpfJ_W00": "[Music] okay so of course low carb and [Music] normally they are very intense but because we use almond flour and whey protein people approve that and flavored

content it is not a makeup video it has nothing to do with makeup so today we're gonna be doing a clothing Tryon I'm gonna show you guys some new clothes that I got I'm also going to talk to you guys about keto what I eat in a day meals meals that I eat that on the ketogenic diet that I have been on for about a year now and I've lost 40 pounds on I'm currently maintained that weight loss I haven't gained any weight back and um I've had a trillion questions from you guys asking me what do you eat on keto because it is one of those lifestyles where it's hard to figure out what can I eat what kind of different meals are there and I feel like I've kind of figured it out and come up with some really tasty things this isn't of course everything that I eat but it is going to go over some of the more common meals that I eat or things that I think are good that you guys should try before we do make sure you guys subscribe to my youtube channel I upload new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday also sometimes on Thursdays and Tuesdays if I have the inclination to throw in an extra video I even did one last Saturday I did a blog which you guys should watch because it has like no views here you guys can also follow me on all my other social media stuff everything is raw Beauty Christy so Instagram Facebook snapchat and Twitter Instagram I have been really loving lately I am doing a ton of different photos on their Instagram videos again I'm really like invigorated to just pump out content so definitely go follow on Instagram you guys won't regret it because I am actually active they're very very active and without further ado let's just try m to show you guys some new clothes I got so I have partnered up with thredUP again to show you guys thrifting haul so if you guys don't know who thread up is I did a video with them before I will link it up here and basically they are an online thrifting company so instead of going to the thrift store and having to rifle through a bunch of stuff you can go online and you can sort things out into categories thredUP makes it super easy to thrift online and I had such a good haul this time you guys are gonna see some of the clothes that I got I honestly scored this time around so so well you can sort things out by color by size by brand you can you can put so many different filters on there where you're only seeing what you want to see and that's how I shop I don't want to see something that is super cute and in a size 2 I wear a size like 12 ish also if you want to be like I don't want to know what H&M has you can look and see you can sort things out by brand plus if somebody else is shopping and they put that item in their cart it tells you this item is currently in someone's cart that is one of my favourite things because you can see like somebody else already nabbed this it's just like a real thrift store if someone put that in there real cart you wouldn't be able to find it on the rack so I'm gonna show you guys what some of the stuff I got today and we're just gonna we're gonna go through it they send everything in this really cute polka dot packaging it's really nicely well put together it feels like you're buying new even though you're buying secondhand the first thing I actually got is this jacket that you see me wearing here it is so cute I love it I've been wearing it all day today I can't take it off it's super comfortable it fits me really nicely it's snug but I know that it's already been pre worn so it's not gonna shrink any smaller than this I'm shrinking because I'm constantly losing weight and so I just love this jacket so much it's my favorite thing of all the stuff I bought I'll show you Jax favorite thing this one's mine his is a dress the second thing I bought is something that I can't show you on me I wish I could but I can't it is this dress here I will show you guys up on the screen what it looks like because I'm obviously really close it's this sequined dress from hmm so so cute I love it so so much but I'm just about a size or two too big for it I'm going to keep it because I really really like it and I feel like it would be really pretty for an event it fits me like this dress fits me but it is so snug I'm not I'm not showing it to anybody who's not my husband let's put it that way this is also one of my favorite items I scored dude I really did I love this style of shirt I think that this print is really cute it says not okay on it but it's like crossed out I know it's like a barcode II looking and I actually think this looks really cute on I you guys know this about me and if you don't well you're about to learn I don't really wear color it's a very very rare that I wear color black gray and white are my favorites I just feel like they're becoming on me maybe that's insecurities I don't know what it is but I just really like only those three colors so you'll sometimes see me in color it's very very rare and usually it's red or yellow this is in the divided brand so this is also from H&M it's just for really cute I like it a lot I'm gonna end up wearing this a ton then there's this dress which I love it's got this zip up in the of it and it is again a little too small for me and it's a little risque if I'm being completely honest with you but it's really really cute I could see wearing this to an event I can see wearing this out with my husband which we don't go out that often this is from boohoo this is a UK size 14 a US size 10 for me this is a little bit small but it actually fits me okay the only thing that's busting out is my boobies because those suckers are relatively large this dress let me tell you it took me 20 minutes to put this dress on it is so cute and this is my husband's favorite piece on me he was like that looks so good on you it hits me directly at the smallest part of my waist and hides everything else because it's like a skater dress style this one is frustrating to put on though because it has like these straps that you have to put the right sleeve on first then you have to cross one over your head and then put your arm in let's just put it this way it took me so long to figure it out Zach and I were getting so frustrated because we could not figure out how to put this dang thing on this is from Nasty Gal this is a size large it fits me so well and this isn't normally the style of dress I go for yet I think this is really flattering on and I'm definitely going to be wearing this to something it's really freakin cute then I got this forever 21 like bomber jacket it's I give this pilot sort of thing it's got this really soft fleecy inside that seems very very new and very unused all of these items that I got feel very like new they don't look secondhand this is a size large I feel like this could be one size up on me and extra-large would have been perfect in this or I just need to shrink a little bit which is the ultimate goal it is definitely a little too short like given that the pockets are up on my boob area but I found a dollar in the pocket Thanks thread up for that dollar and those are all the items that I got from thread up you guys can use the code and the link in the description of this video you guys can save 30% off of your first order if you guys have never ordered from them before thank you so much to thredUP for sponsoring this portion of the video and now we are going to get into what I eat for keto meals ketogenic diet if you guys don't know and you haven't watched my video I highly recommend watching that video before you just jump into the if you don't know what Quito is Quito is kind of controversial but it's also really popular right now I don't know why it just kicked into the limelight all of a sudden it's not something that's new at all in fact it's been around for a long time basically in a nutshell Quito is high fat low carb moderate protein it sounds counterintuitive but I promise you it works for me and it can work for you too I always before anybody starts any sort of change in their eating pattern I recommends talking to your doctor I don't think that there's ever a time where that's a negative I used to do crash dieting back in the day and I would change my diet without talking to my doctor and I really screwed up my body in fact one time I lost weight so quickly that I had to get my gallbladder removed and I developed a whole bunch of gut issues and health issues from my years of crash dieting so I always am really really cautious of anybody taking advice from anyone online I am just somebody on the internet take what I say with a grain of salt your doctor knows better about you than I ever will I talked to my doctor she recommended this to me it is I've been monitored with my blood work I just want to let you guys know if you are doing keto and you did talk to your doctor here are some meals that I find that I really like that keep me not feeling crazy because when you eat such a low carbohydrate lifestyle it can sometimes feel a little daunting you go what do I even eat so hopefully this gives you some insight into some meals that are able and to help me that have been helpful for me that I am sustained on and that I've lost weight on again everybody is different keto doesn't work for everyone either like I have a friend that did it and she didn't lose very much weight on it and she didn't love the way that it made her feel me it makes me feel a thousand times better I basically reversed my PCOS I don't think I even have issues with infertility anymore I'm not sure but I was having like one or two periods a year before keto and now I have one every 28 days I mean it is like on the dot it's crazy it's so weird my blood work I was almost diabetic before like I was like nearing pre-diabetes before my doctor was watching me very closely because it had such high insulin and I have insulin resistance so I just my blood sugar was all over the place I had blood work done and she was like you have to changed something I did keto and I have been doing it and all of my values are good nothing on my blood work has ever looked bad and a lot of people will say like oh you know kiitos bad for this satin that I have been so closely monitored like my doctor I probably had my blood work done maybe like six times in the last year every time is better than the last time I have no issues whatsoever I know that everyone has different opinions on lifestyles and diets and I totally respect yours and I ask that you please respect mine I know that there's a lot of really hefty opinions out there man and I get it I get it I'll that disclaimer side I'm gonna show you guys some meals that I eat that I really like that I think taste good and that keep me keto when I just want to eat carbs sometimes I slip up in eat carbs if you guys follow me on Instagram stories you'll see that sometimes I'm eating ramen sometimes I'm eating noodles but I always go back to keto and I've been able to maintain my weight loss and I'm really happy with this lifestyle I'm doing the best that I can with the lifestyle that I am on and it's relatively restrictive anyway so because it's so restrictive I tend to just eat things I think that tastes good or that are gonna keep me on this lifestyle and keep me happy cuz happiness is important and I'm a foodie I love food I still have about thirty pounds to lose I haven't really been trying since Thanksgiving I from Thanksgiving to like January ain't nothing but carbs I mean I could not I but I didn't keep very much weight and gave me like 5 pounds back let's jump in on the meals [Music] these are the raps that we like to eat these have six grams net carbs in them there also is a wheat version that has 4 grams net carbs I tend to usually go for this one this one I feel is literally almost exactly like a regular tortilla then I go in with some cream cheese this is the garden vegetable flavor I just think it adds a little bit more it's not so boring like regular cream cheese but that's fine too this cheese is also really yummy this is the Sargento garlic and herb cheese and then some oven roasted turkey you can leave this out if you're vegetarian we typically use romaine lettuce in it but we're gonna be using this today this is like kale and like it has even Brussels sprouts and like cabbage and stuff in it romaine lettuce has recalled at the moment for like e.coli and kidney failure so we really don't want to have some kidney failure right now so we're just gonna go with a little bit of this instead this is one of those meals that I make when you want to feel like you're eating carbs but you want to keep lower carb it's probably about 10 grams net carbs for the total meal maybe like 11 or 12 so this is a higher carb meal if you eat like under 25 grams of carbs per day you should be golden to stay in keto and I never have tissues with us at all [Music] I typically add like six slices of turkey ears [Music] these are the brand quest and these are the protein chips there are three grams net carbs in the entire bag they are so satisfying sometimes pedo chips can be like hideously disgusting these are very satisfying this is a like I want you feel like I'm eating carbs style lunch and yeah there's like 11 grams of carbs in this basically and yeah not bad at all really really tasty really really satisfying and really filling you doing [Music] all right some hot Italian sausage or hamburger or turkey or no meat because this can be vegetarian buncha jalapenos we're using the chive and onion cream cheese and regular cream cheese you can use whatever kind of cream cheese that you would like yes you can this is how I do it I cut them in half but some people just hollow them out like this but I kind of in half cuz it's way easier to just cut them and then cut the seeds out just do this a hundred times yeah and then about 45 more times the cutest in the whole world [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it seems like a lot of food but again we only eat one to two times a day and we eat bigger meals so that we get our calories and show those one or two meals and then we intermittent fast for like I would say anywhere from 14 to 18 hours and that's dinner this is a dinner that we have sometimes we usually use it with steak we have some chicken in the fridge so we wanted to use that instead I'm not a huge chicken fan but what that grape sauce on it or anything is gonna taste good and this is I would say an average dinner for us but usually at stake we are going to go enjoy it now [Music] [Music] [Music] Mayo lemons pepper and sriracha [Music] well I hope this video was interesting for you guys and it was helpful for you and if you guys want to check out thread up don't forget you guys can click the link in the description of this video and use the code to save 30% off of your first order with thread up I don't you think you'll be disappointed I hope the meals ideas helped you I will leave a bunch of information in the description of this video and also if you guys have any questions please leave them in the comments I of course have a billion different things that I eat on this lifestyle like I sometimes make keto pizzas where I'll do like a low-carb tortilla I'll put some low carb sauce on it some cheese and pepperoni or whatever you want to put on there and then you just broil it in the oven and that can be really satisfying which I didn't show you guys in this video a lot of times most more often than not what I eat is Caesar salad like or just salad in general I just I eat a lot of avocado right now all the avocados at our store were like total crap which is why you probably haven't seen any in this video I also follow intermittent fasting which if you guys don't know intermittent fasting is basically where you don't eat for a big chunk of like the night and some of the day and then you eat the majority of your calories within a smaller window so for me I tend to eat from like 2:00 to 8:00 or some days at you from like 2:00 to 6:00 I know it goes against a lot of what we were taught younger but I urge you to research it don't just take my word for it there's a lot of studies that have been done on intermittent fasting and it is a pretty amazing thing and I find that when I do it I feel so much better my energy is through the roof my headaches are less my stomach aches are non-existent and I lose more weight and I just generally feel better so there's it's really a win-win I'm going to list some more meals and recipes and links and things like that in the description of this video so any questions you have check their first because likely they'll be good information down there that would be helpful I know that you know maybe what I eat is different than what you eat maybe you don't like anything that I mentioned or maybe you think it sounds good but I just wanted to give you guys some helpful information because I definitely want to do more lifestyles videos and I want to talk to you guys about like you know workouts and more lack thereof and me and outfits and more style stuff and leaving the house and vlogs and I just want to know if you guys want to see that because it seems like there's a handful of you guys that do but the majority of you are really just interested in like first impressions and makeup but I'm more than just makeup we all are so watch those videos okay come on alright well I thank you guys so much for watching I hope this video was somewhat helpful for you again check the description if you have any questions at all are you guys looking for links or anything and I thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you at my next video bye is it recording no I don't believe you would you do your best catwalk do your best James that was pretty good literally are wearing it literally like

wad of money no like that well don't be so great about it there you go [Laughter] that's cute I like that's a letter good so instead of going to the thrift store and having to rifle through all the different clothes you guys can go online and try on clothes what so instead of having to go to the thrift store rifle through a bunch of stuff and so instead of going to the thrift store and having to rifle through a bunch of stuff you crunch through a bunch of stuff I'd love to rifle through some brunch you have to like put the right art on bug hey guys today I am going to be [Music]",

lava crunch cakes and they run for 399 and you get two individual little cakes and let's just check them out I'm a pretty big fan of the molten lava cakes from Chili's and what I've always seen the commercials and stuff I always kind of was hoping to be someone like that but I guess we're going to find out right now as you can see right here in the land of desert chocolate lava crunch cakes are king so I guess we'll find out see if that's true so we'll open it up I actually don't ring it too much about these I've just seen a few commercials and always thought they look pretty cool so they look like just little little pucks dusted with some powdered sugar a little hard to the touch around the edges I think I'm just gonna grab one and OH nice and greasy on the bottom I'm just gonna go ahead just break this in half just use my hands hug it oh and that's a molten gooeyness on the inside and the thing I'm just gonna take a bite see how it tastes alright that was a little different even though it says crunch in the toggle it still wasn't really expecting it to be crunchy as it's still expecting kind of a cakey texture but now it's actually kind of crunchy and it's it's kind of different but it's delicious it's like easy-bake meets Oreo meets super fudge like brownie cake stuffed with this like delicious fudge filling it's extremely sweet extremely chocolatey and rich but overall it's pretty delicious if you like chocolate or chocolate cookies like Oreo stuff like that I mean this is like an Oreo cake for 399 I don't really know if it's worth it for these two little little bucks but I mean I think a little bit of ice cream would probably make these a lot better so I mean it'd be great dessert to go with your pizza get a scoop of vanilla ice cream some of this

and it is so easy to make firstly get yourself 500 grams worth of new potatoes and give them a rinse and then slice your potatoes into halves or if you've got some big ones slice them into three and once your potatoes are prepared put some water in a pan and bring it to the boil throw your potatoes in and then boil them for about 15 minutes and then after that time slice into a couple of them to make sure that cooked through and they're nice and tender then take your potatoes off the hob rinse out the water and then leave them to cool now get yourself a mixing bowl and then it's time to prepare the garlic so get yourself a couple of cloves bash them peel them and then finely chop them add the garlic to the mixing bowl and then get yourself a handful of parsley finely chop this as well and then add it to the bowl with the garlic next up get yourself a handful of spring onions slice off each end and then finely chop them as well add the spring onions to the mixing bowl along with the parsley in the garlic and then crack open a jar of mayo then add three really generous tablespoons worth of mayonnaise to the mixing bowl and then give the ingredients a thorough stir and if you're worried about the fat content we used extra light mayonnaise and it still tasted fantastic and finally pour your cold potatoes into the mixing bowl and combine everything together and there you have it a really simple and tasty potato salad recipe that is essential if you are having a barbeque this summer and you want to impress your guests and you can check out even more of my recipes that are perfect for the summer by clicking on one of the videos coming up", "LEX1nv3PdS8": "[Music] um boom [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] you", "a_omK3wxkhE": "hi guys I have another keto cooking I'm just gonna show you what we're gonna have our supper so these are burgers I've bought them pre-made they are bacon cheddar beef patties I got them at our local grocery store which is giant we live in Pennsylvania so this is the macros for that so only two carbs for Patty and me just like one sugar but a great protein and bad so we're gonna make those I'm gonna put a little bit of this on it which is Karnes is another local grocery store but we're gonna put a little bit of this seasoning on of them and we're gonna make them on the grill I don't know who really put more cheese since there is cheese like built in to the burger but why not try maybe and then we're also going to try this smart bun tonight I haven't opened them yet the smart cakes are amazing so I'm hoping that these taste is great if you're not familiar with the brand I'll link it down below but zero carbs for them so I'll just show you in nutrition on the side too and it's cool because they even tell you the net carbs is zero and having 10 percent or 10 grams of protein is great so we're also going to have cauliflower I'll show you what I'm gonna do with that in just a little bit after I cut it up um my husband and I talked about like doing the smart bun maybe one burger with a smart bun and then the other one with a chill awful so maybe we'll do a little comparison at that and off his opinion to see what he likes better so alright stay tuned alright now I'm back with the cauliflower so I cut the cauliflower all of this is that bowl that I was talking about earlier from Big Lots so there is something that I've always wanted to try Chris gets his chips from the Dollar Tree they do taste really well but they're really kinda hard so I never can eat more than one they have 30 grams of carbs but in her bag but maybe I eat one or two but I know those taste anything and their ingredients aren't favorable and then I wouldn't use any of those oils we're going to use coconut oil that I already have but I'm going to put the garlic powder paprika the turmeric and then I'm going to do the Himalayan salt and also black pepper and then I'm going to part some grated Parmesan cheese on it also after I like put the oil and it kind of sticks a little better and then it'll crisp up and then I'm gonna put it in the airfryer so once I get this all taken care of then I will show you what I do with the airfryer but I want to show you to you that we have this coconut oil it's usually solid but it's warm in the summer so it's a liquid we also got this one it doesn't taste but great with everything but this is public of what I'm gonna use today it has ma non dairy butter and a garlic flavor in it and the carbs on that one are great too that they have zero carbs in it so something that we've also done is just one of these squeezy bottles I've done with coconut oil too so when we are doing vegetables I want to squeeze it into a pan I can do that so let me do this and I'll show you the airfryer next all right so this is my airfryer and I am going to close it and then I just push this button at the top and it brings on the screen I'm going to change the temp I'm gonna do it to 400 and then the time I'm actually gonna just prep it I've read a lot about popping it helps it cook faster so I'm gonna just pop it for about five minutes and I also can turn on a light and I can watch whatever I'm cooking so when I'm actually gonna use and what I love about mmm this one is a rotisserie actually on there is probably just dried but um you can put this in and it comes everything kind of evenly which I really love so once I get everything in there I will show you what it looks like in so just to show you I put that in there and then there's a rotate button that you're able to push it at alternate as it cooks so I'm just gonna let that go I could change the time to 18 minutes so I'm just gonna let that go while I am starting the chill awful that we are gonna make so here is the smart bun after we toasted it so if you haven't seen them before they have sesame seeds on them just like a regular burger then it did make a chill awful if you're not sure how to make that I'll link the video below that I made this morning for breakfast so it does come in a bigger shape this one kind of got calm but I just cut it up in little triangles so they can cover the meat a little bit so if I am going to use this for the burger I really can just go like this cover it with any of the dressings I want cover it up with that if I feel like I really need something that's fun with keto I'm really cool which is eating this with a lot of humor a lot of mustard and ketchup we're not gonna add any cheese because there's cheese inside and also the falafel has cheese so we will show you with a plate at the end looks like with our cauliflower also right so here is what it looks like at the end so I just made myself a little fun with that burger with a chihuahua and then I did the theme normally I put some relish ketchup and mustard on there and then here's a cauliflower the reason it changed colors because of the tumeric but I swear that is great so my husband took a bite of both tell me what do you think of the bun pretty much tastes like a regular bun you can't really tell it's not flour and that's waffle let's watch what do you think it tastes like it I can see I can cheese yeah it's pretty much like a little bit nicer yeah pretty much just gets nice and crispy so we are kind of excited to play around with the recipe it's a little bit I'm really excited to eat it's like pizza like pepperoni and stuff um just be aware of the smartphone's when we did get them we didn't eat them right away they do come individually wrap like this but a few of them were moldy so we did not eat those we just threw them away right away again if you want to check out the smart phones and the smart cakes I'll link that below if you want to know how to make a chill awful you can see in my other video and the link down below we are going to eat some great food tonight and then check out my next video thanks have a great night", "1WZA8oSVFCk": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying three oh yeah bars Kevin has the oh yeah one bar and I have just oh yeah bars these are all bought at the Vitamin Shoppe I have a little cheat sheet these small bars that I have for a dollar seventy nine Kevin's bar was 250 now pretty heavy so okay so I have the almond fudge brownie and the chocolate and caramel bar gonna have chocolate birthday cake let's try yours first what brand of sugar 22 grams of protein 210 calories for the whole bar that's good there they are would you eat this bar it's approaching Mars yeah okay yeah I have a lot of protein to matters like III is your gluten-free this is a bit of front okay well then it's probably not actually players protein bar okay that just means it probably heavier it's made in Charlotte North Carolina I think I've known that split that before and every bar called sprinkles yeah I think I've said that before Charlotte because of Bob and cherry are in Charlotte I'm in Charlotte I mention bar Bob and Terry like they're my friends they're my best friends Bob and Jerry much a shot for her trolley I went to Raleigh for computer step that's actually good it tastes like chocolate we tried the vanilla and everyone writes about the vanilla and the vanilla which is okay to me Kevin really like the vanilla um I like this one better than the vanilla it tastes like a very muted chocolate that yeah it's like it's like they've added a little bit of cocoa powder or something to it but not just enough to make it chocolate but then not a lot and it doesn't so like feel that grainy feel it does not feel that - yeah I know a lot of you really love these ova1 bars for me they're not something that I would valvetime yeah just being completely honest but it's okay it's yeah it's okay yeah yeah it's just okay it wouldn't be it wouldn't be my first first to lay offense better mm-hmm yes just recently we did actually okay this is almond fudge brownie let's try this on an issue different yeah these are both gluten free like I said it has 14 grams of protein zero trans fat unprecedented taste let's say bold claim it's only a hundred writing hours that's good okay they're all going right how many ounces is this it's 45 grams oh yeah - 60 grams and that one's just slightly more powers than yours yeah I guess because the nut you know was enormous let's go yeah and it's there's a lot in here almond fudge brownie I mean look at that that's the whole center surrounded by nuts chopped up oh is that chocolate some chocolate the chocolate Center yeah it kinda looks like the center of that this nuts tastes like maracas pecan yeah they're at home hmm they're a Walmart or something it's like a disco oh that's okay that the almonds are good I like that a lot I like that a lot better than that a lot more that is brilliant but it's this because of the almonds it's not because the the center part that's don't necessarily like the center part those almonds them they cover any taste that might be negative to you they do and I love the texture that's like eating the candy more thrilling yeah active an on-suite cheap candy boy no does any I don't like it I really know I really do like that yeah but you could just get a handful almonds eat them and be just as well good but but it's good I mean if you're looking for something like this and a little pirates 490 calories I think it's good and he wants up more than an almond flavor there is chocolate in the Buddha chocolate or no and this is the chocolate and caramel it has 15 grams approaching zero trans fat and unprecedented taste it is also 190 calories so this is should be the same thing except caramel so we'll see if the caramel caramel Hansen has almonds yes sure I was just this chocolate egg normal just going to fall I know that's what's going on okay let me write because you can't read it says soit's going nuts is the worst so approaching that's the thing you don't yeah and I didn't get that from that first one no I didn't get this from the candy bar at all it was really good caramel I didn't say your peanut there extrusive our peanut peanuts dude mm-hmm no in throw peanuts no but it's like a peanut okay yeah two from the caramel like a caramel feel and you really taste the peanuts but you don't get a strong caramel flavor that day you know it's a stronger flavor kind of just feels like oh you can see the car around you know what though I don't like you too I probably I'm trying to decide what I think I like that one the best the one with the peanut the car yeah I really like well it's not the caramel because you really don't do that caramel one the caramel bar I like the flavor of peanuts though so that's why I like it accurately so for me that peanut flavor is really good and I think that's a good price I would much rather pay a dollar 79 for one of these then what 214 259 I'm telling you and these have fewer calories that is really good so if your body needs to get your brunching how much protein it does to all time yeah so these don't have as much this one that's 15 I think that one it for me it doesn't have as much but as far as flavor goes these have much much better flavor than that they really do that's all good bar although I do like those okay and I still think there's better alternatives but but I like those yeah yeah if you want about the oh yeah one brand if you haven't tried these because a lot of people they've recommended the Oh yellow horse but I've never had anybody recommend these and I'm wondering if if you all haven't tried them because if you haven't you need to these the ones to eat so I'm gonna have a picture for you at the end if you enjoyed the video please give us a thumbs up and thanks for watching

Today's video is demonstrating how to make this keto teriyaki steak entree. The macro nutrient ratio for this recipe is 2.7 to one with 3.5 grams of total carbs, 0.1 grams of dietary fiber, resulting in 3.4 grams of net carbs. This Japanese main dish is very easy to make and only takes about 10 to 15 minutes. The timing will depend on how well done you like your steak. The ingredients you will need are fresh garlic, which is diced into very thin slices, grapeseed oil and butter. Half and half of my keto teriyaki sauce and glaze combined together, and your steaks, to which you apply pepper on both sides. And you also salt both sides of the steak, and after you've done that, set the steaks aside for a moment. Now set your stove top element to medium low. Add the oil and butter to a frying pan or wok. Stir to combine and add the thinly sliced garlic. Fry the garlic until it's golden and crispy. Doing this will infuse the garlic flavor into the oil garlic combination. When your garlic is done scoop it out and put it into a dish and set it aside for a moment. Then increase your heat to medium-high. Place the steaks into the pan and brown until a crispy layer has formed on the underside of the steak. Using your tongs flip to the other side and brown and crisp that side as well. This should only take about 2 to 5 minutes per side. Then reduce your element heat to medium at this point. I like to lift the steaks so that the butter and oil can get underneath. Next take your Teriyaki sauce and glaze mix and pour half of the content over the steaks in the pan. Then flip the steaks and pour the other half of your teriyaki sauce glaze on top. Keep frying the steaks until you have them done to the degree that you like, whether it's medium rare or medium. Then take the steaks out of the frying pan or wok and set them aside. As always, Let them rest for a minimum of 10 minutes so that the juices can reabsorb into the meat. Also this point: Pour the remaining teriyaki sauce that is still in the pan into a little dish and set that aside. After the meat has rested, the final step in preparing the steaks is to cut each of the steaks into 1.5 cm or a little over half an inch wide strips. Here you can see that. I have prepared the steaks to a medium rare for my family. After cutting the steaks, I arrange them on a plate, then I sprinkle the crispy garlic slices on top, and using the leftover sauce that I had set aside, I spoon it over the meat. This makes a really nice presentation. Here's a second presentation I prepared using this amazing Japanese entree. Or you can serve individual servings onto a plate along with the ginger and garlic bok choy as I did here, and, if you still have a little room, this amazing dinner can be made even better with a slice of my matcha white chocolate mousse cake. I hope you try this recipe very soon. Enjoy! I'd really like to hear from you, so please let me know what other recipes you're craving, which I can post for you on this channel.

in the microwave in just 90 seconds it's great for sandwiches and even a delicious grilled cheese he's got budget meals for families delicious new recipes bring your friends over let's make it a shed his sneakers [Music] so to start grab yourself a large ramekin or round microwave-safe flat bottom bowl and add the butter to the dish now melt the butter for 20 seconds in the microwave or until melted and once melted add the baking powder which will help the bread rise and then add in the almond flour and finally the egg mix everything together really well until you have a lump free batter now place the batter into the microwave on HIGH for 90 seconds don't touch it or check it just leave it to do its thing but be careful because the bowl is going to be hot so use a tea towel when picking it up and then run a knife around the edge just to make sure it comes out nicely and then flip it over and there you have a wonderful soft fluffy pita bread that is excellent for sandwiches I also love to toast it as well which you can do in the toaster obviously just by cutting it in half but I add some butter to a pan and toast them like this for a couple minutes on high this is also a great time to add some cheese to it and make it a keto grilled cheese if you wish the almond flour really toasts nicely just like normal bread would but you could also use coconut flour as well which works the same and you can swap the butter out for oil too it's completely up to you you'll find the recipe link in the description along with the new along with all the nutritional info thanks so

bread tastes like bread don't i mean it's not super clean we do use an ingredient car called carb quick um and i'll show it to you here but trust me that it's worth it for the treat um this isn't something that you would have every day this is something when you're like gosh i'm really craving bread and like i don't want to cheat and fall off track and then like you know just stumble and tumble off the wagon so this is that type of recipe it's phenom you're gonna feel like you're eating real bread but it's still low carb and keto friendly so let's get started with this recipe so we're going to start off with carb quick and this flour does have gluten and it does it isn't like the cleanest flour but trust me you can make biscuits you can make so many different recipes with this flour so this is just one of many recipes that you can make so here we have 1 and 3 4 cup of carb quick this box right here you can purchase it online on amazon and now walmart sells it as well so it costs about eight dollars at walmart and i think it's probably a little over 11 on amazon okay and then the rest of the ingredients we have our warm water some yeast this is a yeasted bread so we're going to activate that now we have our butter some parmesan cheese and then our seasonings okay so let's get started with activating our yeast so first we're going to start off with a half cup of warm water and you have to make sure that it's warm but not boiling because it will kill your yeast and then we have a teaspoon of yeast sprinkle that in and we're gonna do one tablespoon of sugar and yes you do need real sugar for this because you need to feed the yeast so we're gonna just give this a quick little mix and now we're gonna let it sit for 10 minutes okay so now we're gonna make our garlic butter and so here we have half cup of melted butter we have half a teaspoon of italian seasoning so we're just gonna sprinkle that in half teaspoon of garlic powder and then we have three tablespoons of shredded parmesan cheese throw that right in and you will see what we're gonna be using this for but ooh stay tuned you guys get i mean you guys are gonna be obsessed with this if you've been missing bread this is gonna be the closest thing okay so our garlic butter is done now we're gonna set this aside and move on to the next step okay so now that our yeast is pretty much um

have this but you can also make biscuits and cookies and a bunch of stuff this is just for like once in a while this isn't something that you would be eating like every day okay let's mix our dough okay so we're also gonna need a cookie sheet and some parchment paper okay and now that our dough is uh needed what we're gonna do is start making our little you know our little balls and if you want them to be all the same size then just weigh out your dough and then that way you know exactly how much each little ball should you know away now that they're all portioned out we're going to let these sit for about 30 minutes until they rise and if you have a clean dish towel then do that and if you don't then you can do a little paper napkin like me okay so now let's go ahead and check on our little rolls they've been resting and what we're gonna do is we are going to top them with our mixture this is our garlic butter and if you can see that um typically you would do it with a brush i don't have my little brush right now available so we're gonna just get a little bit of add the cheese you make sure that get a little bit of cheese on there and you can save some of this garlic butter for dipping after you still want to get some butter around the actual roll so i'm super excited about these right now go ahead and just top your little breads with some fresh parsley if you don't have fresh then you can just use some dried parsley so now let's bake these at 300 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes okay guys so our rolls are all done can you see how beautiful these look i seriously cannot

are you ready to step up your dinner game because i am today i'm going to share my perfect dinner recipe that is fried chicken with creamy white mushroom sauce it's super delicious and i highly recommend that you try it out as it's really easy to make before we begin consider subscribing to my channel and hit that like button it's free for you doesn't cost you anything but it really adds value to my channel by the way full recipe in both metric and imperial units is in the description below so do check that out and i do use a weighing skill to measure out things in grams for making this recipe you're also going to need some chicken fillets you want to make sure they're about quarter inch thick you can also hammer it down to make it that thick and i'm going to season about six to seven pieces of fillet the very first thing i do with the chicken is add some garlic paste which is basically minced garlic using three cloves this step really enhances the chicken's flavor next i added half a teaspoon or two grams of montreal steak salt as this helps add smokiness to the chicken you can easily find this seasoning at the grocery store next i added half a teaspoon or 1 gram of black pepper 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of paprika powder then add some soy sauce about 1 teaspoon or 4 grams also add about 4 grams or half a teaspoon of vinegar then add about 1 4 teaspoon or 1 gram of oregano and also add half a teaspoon or 2 grams of mustard paste that's all the seasoning that we're going to put in there i know it seems like a lot of ingredients but each ingredient plays an important role in seasoning this chicken you probably also noticed that i didn't add any salt that's because soy sauce already has a lot of salt but it's up to you if you want to add additional salt by the way this chicken recipe is almost similar to my mcchicken recipe so do check that video out if you would like next you want to mix everything up very nicely so that all the ingredients get incorporated you can also marinate the chicken if you like but generally it's not required next we're going to put the chicken to the side and focus on making the sauce and honestly this sauce is so amazing that you're going to want to put this on everything as you can see this sauce really takes this recipe to the next level it makes food look luxurious to make this white creamy sauce you're going to start by putting one tablespoon or 30 grams of butter in a pan you want to heat up the butter until you start seeing some bubbles and once you do add in about 50 grams or half of a small onion and you want to make sure that you dice the onion you would want to saute the onion for about three to four minutes or until the onion starts becoming translucent next you want to add about 50 grams or half a cup of mushrooms i'm just using mushrooms out of a can in this case but you could use fresh mushrooms as well if you like give everything a nice mix and next you're ready to season this for seasoning the sauce i started by adding in half a teaspoon or one gram of black pepper remember to tweak the seasoning as per your taste so if you don't like the extra heat then don't add that much black pepper then add about half a teaspoon or 3 grams of salt then add 1 cup or 225 grams of heavy cream this gives our sauce the creaminess next you want to stir everything up and let your sauce start simmering wait for at least two to three minutes until it starts bubbling you can also turn up the heat so that this process becomes faster once you start seeing the bubbles then it's time to start adding the rest of the ingredients start by adding half a teaspoon or one gram of white pepper you can easily find white pepper at the grocery store next for some added cake add about half a teaspoon or one gram of red chili flakes also to make the sauce aromatic and smell super delicious add half a teaspoon of tarragon leaves you can also easily find these at the grocery store under the spice section but if you don't have these then you could also substitute for rosemary leaves you want to cook everything for about three to four minutes or until the sauce starts thickening and just to show you this is the amount of thickness you want on the sauce because when you turn off the heat it's gonna get even thicker and that's pretty much it for making the sauce the total amount of time it should take you to make the sauce is around five to six minutes from start to finish next we're going to prepare the batter for frying the chicken crack open two large or medium sized eggs doesn't matter add a splash of milk to it you want to whisk everything up until the eggs become frothy sometimes i cheat by putting the eggs in the magic bullet but then my container stings afterwards so don't do that after whisking your eggs your consistency should look something like this at this point move your eggs to the side and we're going to set up our breading station i'm going to use panko breadcrumbs as this helps make our chicken really crispy for a single piece of chicken you need about half a cup of panko breadcrumbs next you want to dip your chicken into the egg mix you want to make sure you coat everything properly otherwise the bread crumbs won't adhere properly so dip your chicken in nicely and transfer it over to the breadcrumb side and then toss over your bread crumbs on top of the chicken and press it down flip it and do the same thing on the other side you want to make sure that all the bread crumbs adhere properly to the chicken and in the end it should all look like this and now we are ready to fry the chicken when you fry the chicken you want to make sure that your heat is not that high otherwise the panko breadcrumbs will burn quickly you want to make sure that your heat is around medium to low medium heat you're going to cook the chicken for about three minutes on each side so a total of six minutes after six minutes your chicken should look like this crispy and golden brown on all sides now at this point we're ready to serve the dinner by combining our chicken with the sauce for some reason i accidentally deleted the footage for plating everything but basically i have rice mashed potatoes carrots and peas a complete dinner meal once you're ready to serve just pour over the creamy white mushroom sauce onto the chicken and i cannot tell you how delicious that sauce and chicken is all together this is one of my most favorite dinners of all time and here's me trying to take a bite out of it i hope you heard that crunch i do hope that you try making this recipe as it's really easy to make i do know that there are a lot of ingredients that go in here but trust me they're worth it if you do end up making this and enjoying it do leave me a

With that said, we\u2019re gonna start this year of recipes off with our old friend the slow cooker and make one of my more recent favorite chili recipes. This white chicken chili takes no time at all to prep, is packed with protein, will last you the whole week, and hopefully paves another road for you to get that much closer to your goals so let\u2019s just jump right into it! We\u2019re gonna start this one by doing 2 things. 1. Optionally lining our slow cooker for easy clean up and 2. Saut\u00e9ing a chopped up yellow onion and 2-3 cloves of garlic with a tablespoon of olive oil. Now once you\u2019re done that, all you have to do is add everything into your slow cooker starting with 3 pounds of fat trimmed chicken breast. Continue with 3 cups of chicken broth, 4 ounces of diced green chiles (your choice heat), 4 ounces of diced jalape\u00f1os, 2 cups of corn, 2 teaspoons of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon of oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, a little black pepper, your saut\u00e9ed onion and garlic mix, 2 cans of a drained and rinsed white bean with 1/2 of 1 can mashed up like this which will help thicken up your chili even more, today I\u2019m using some great northern beans. Give that a quick mix, throw your lid on, and turn your slow cooker on low for 5-6 hours or high for 3-4 hours. After that, shred your chicken which should shred super easy, add in 1 container of a plain Greek yogurt, and 4 ounces of cream cheese. Continue cooking on low heat until those are mixed in and it\u2019s creamy, it should thicken up a bit more. So there you go, portion it out into 6 servings and you\u2019ll have protein packed chili for the entire week. Also, don\u2019t forget, all of the recipes are now available to print or scale on TheProteinChef.co. You can also see the full nutritional breakdown right inside the recipe card. I link to every recipe now in the description. Now before we go I think we should start this year off with a giveaway. I\u2019m thinking of a number 1 through 365. First person to get it, gets a little Protein Chef care package. One guess per person!

these seasonings although you can omit those if you want the base for this zero carb pancake recipe is pork rinds so there's gonna be a savory pancake something that you can make like as a side dish for dinner you can make like a breakfast sandwich or just even any kind of sandwich with these or you can just eat them as pancakes savory pancakes we're gonna start we have a food processor the nice thing about this recipe is everything is done in the food processor then you just pour it into a pan and make the pancakes so this here is three ounces of pork rinds just original flavor and we're going to start by just processing this into a fine powder okay so that was about 20 seconds and you can see there it's a pretty fine powder but it's not like super blended to where it just starts all clumping together so at this point I like to add the spices and the baking powder we're gonna add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder the seasonings I like is like a little bit of spice and then garlic and onion powder so we're gonna use some red pepper flakes about a quarter teaspoon I just eyeball it some black pepper a little bit of garlic powder some onion powder some oregano and then just a pinch of salt we're gonna add 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to this mixture and we're gonna pulse that one more time okay now we got the wet ingredients we got four eggs and next we're gonna add coconut milk you can use almond milk you can use flax milk don't get the coconut milk in the can though we're using the unsweetened variety and then we're just going to mix this all together it'll come together into a pancake batter so that's the final mixture right there you can see it's pretty thin but also it'll stick together we're gonna heat a nonstick pan over a low to medium heat and then we'll start making pancakes I'm gonna put a little bit of coconut oil in the pan you might have to spread it with your spoon just a little bit so the batter really actually thickens up as it sits like this was really thin before putting it in the pan but now it's actually quite thick so you guys can see just like normal pancakes this starts to bubble when it's ready to be flipped [Music] [Music] pancakes are done we just took photos that's why this looks so pretty but it's time to try these look at those guys so I just top it with butter okay you could do some kind of like cheese sauce for these would be really good garlic sauce like a garlic butter sauce would be awesome let's give this a try going in for the middle big piece though there really good flavor I feel like you could even go a little bit harder with the seasonings if you wanted to the texture the fluffiness it's really not what you would expect from a pork rind pancake I don't think because it's it's like actually it's actually like really fluffy and like bendable these pancakes are really good I think the way that I would use these in my daily life is as like a side dish for dinner you want these instead of biscuits or like instead of a bread that you used to maybe have when you're doing carbs you're having bread these are a great replacement give these a try guys these are truly phenomenal zero carb pancakes it's a big old pile of flapjacks [Music] [Music]", "h-Hjue5wFho": "in today's society we are under missile constant battle between manufacturers to create the perfect tastes oblivious to the constants in our

you could bring me tea bag and lemon zest from the celestial brand and I'm going to just use two equal this is what I have inside the salon so no stevia so I'm gonna use two equal in the team hey guys please remember to subscribe to cami kita je for more keto recipes guys it's a Friday morning and I'm cooking up a storm even though the quantity is fairly small it's a wide variety now I heard in that back there some chicken legs and one chicken wing that was preseason but I'm gonna just touch it up a notch with some rotisserie seasoning from McCormick and some Burberry twelves by seasoning in today's meal I will definitely be using some parmesan some chili garlic sauce I'll use some garlic butter not the carry goal I didn't bother to use that but I'll use the garlic spread some extra virgin olive oil some stevia to sweeten the pot a bit among other items that I'll talk about but I'll definitely link all the ingredients I use into these recipes I'm going to start off by making some deep gashes into the chicken legs no I did that because it was morning time I had to go to work and so I needed this to cook very quickly it was seasoned from like two days ago so you know it's well marinated but I just did the gashes so for presentation and also because I wanted it to cook right through and very quickly you guys know normally on a Friday it's fast food so I have to make it a little extra and fancy so it's a garlic parmesan for the wings and sweet garlic chili sauce for the chicken legs now I'm going to take cold about a teaspoon and a half of the garlic chili sauce no guys I recommend for this quantity just one teaspoon cuz I took out too much but anyways it didn't go to waste so after I took out that amount I'm going to add two packs of stevia to this and you know get it nice and sweet the flavor of this sauce is really really good I put the name below for you guys please like this video if you would like to see me do more what I eat in a day videos also subscribe to the channel after I added the stevia I mix it thoroughly to have it all combined to coat the chicken after it is fried and guys this sauce was the bomb you have to have to try this sauce I'm going to add some extra virgin olive oil to a frying pot and then add the chicken after the oil is heated no you don't want to overcrowd the pot because you want the chicken to be crisp and nice if you add too much chicken at a time it will get the oil temperature John and then smooth the frying process so you want to add a small amount at a time no I'm going to make a salad while the chicken is being fried just a regular garden salad with some lettuce some tomato cucumber a little sweet pepper and onion you remember guys I'm not a chef so I don't have the big knife chopping through after take my time and I'm using a piece of onion I just did just a little three slices there about because it's a salad I'm not seasoning meat or anything so I just needed a little bit to give to keep that salad open arch I am doing thin slices of this bell pepper to add to my salad know guys you can up the fat content in this salad by adding some bacon bits or avocado use a dressing with other vile or some ranch dressing you can add some cheese to it just you know to kick up that fat content a bit we're going in or with some thin slices of Cocoon bar I really do like my cucumber in cubes I don't know I just decided to do slices that morning but you can present it any way you like whether in cubes or slices it doesn't matter a salad is a salad right guys so I lost the clip with the tomatoes being sliced but I usually cut them in half for my salads and there you have my wings all fried up I'm going to add the other two leg to the pot to be fried in the meantime and I'm gonna melt some garlic butter and add it to the wings now guys you would need to add enough butter according to the amount of wings that you are doing I just had one piece of wing and cut it in the separate the wing from the the like leg part from the flap so I just use about a tablespoon of butter and I didn't even add all of it after it was melted to the wing so I just did like 1 1 garlic parmesan wing and then I do the other three chicken legs in the garlic chili sweet garlic chili sauce so I'm going in with the garlic with the Parmesan cheese and then I'll give this a nice shake you'll see me going back in with some more cheese because it wasn't well coated no you want the cheese to be well coated on the chicken and the butter will have it stick so you can just add the cheese and the required amount of butter as per your serving of wings guys know guys if you've never had garlic butter parmesan wings before you need to have it okay it is phenomenal best thing in life so my chicken legs are fine and I'm gonna go in with this sweet garlic chili sauce and base each chicken leg on both sides I'm gonna add it to the oven at about 400 degrees for 10 minutes taking it out at the 5 minute mark and flipping it I'm not gonna let it stay into the oven for long because I don't want it to be dried out gays I can't stress enough how good this sauce was you have to have the half the trade case please remember to subscribe to my channel I'm looking forward to hearing from you in the comment section also remember to turn on your notification bell so you won't miss a video and we're gonna add these chicken legs to the oven and get started on my shake for the morning which is made of the following ingredients so I brought some coffee the other day and I just wanted to use a little mean dog so I'm gonna add about a cup and a half of coffee probably a cup yeah I'm not really good with the measurements of the edge but I'm gonna add some coffee some unsweetened coconut milk but I got from Paris smart I usually get the whole box of six there I'm gonna also add my chocolate protein powder the one that's I'm using no I got that from our friend I'm going to leave the name of it below it's very very good I enjoy the taste of it so I can share that with you guys I'm also gonna add my regular spices which I use in the morning for my coffee make sure to do a video with all the stuff I usually put into my cool coffee in the mornings so that's the I'm also gonna add stevia to this shake to Sascha's and some cinnamon nutmeg and vanilla guys I don't normally measure the amount of spices i add to my coffee in the morning i just eyeball it so I'm going in with the serving science of the key to me replacement protein powder which is two scoops and then I'm gonna add my Benjamin vanilla I'm just gonna do like a cork fool - so she of member selects TPL I also got our from price marked and some nutmeg island space and some cinnamon I think the brand also is Island spice gonna add definitely that the cork full of vanilla and that's the Benjamins vanilla burn and the island spice nutmeg and cinnamon I go very hard to understand Aman you can't get enough of the cinnamon powder but she definitely wants to just chill with the not make after I am finished adding all the spices I will give this a good shake to get everything smooth and nice no this bottle is 16 ounces and it comes with a spring that you put into the bottle to get everything nice and combined this shake will be used to break my fast this morning so the first thing for me I'm gonna go back to my salad and add a little feta cheese to eat a feta cheese now is one of my favourite cheese for salad I usually use the parmesan a grated Parmesan cheese but now I do strictly feta cheese in my salad it goes really well with any salad dressing that you would use on it for my snacks today I'm gonna do about 2 ounces of almond and that's just raw one not roasted not seeing or anything no guys I've just checked on my chicken leg and this is how it looks at the five minute mark I'm going to turn it over and add it back to the oven for another five minutes no guys after the final five minutes this is how the chicken legs look I plated it just for presentation purpose and I'm gonna just drop those chicken wings right in the middle of the chicken thanks just to show you guys we complete meals that

Kirkland almond flour baking powder garlic powder we have mexicana stout she's from price Mart mozzarella and from Dutch farm from the regular supermarket I got some sharp cheddar cheddar cheese I think I got that from family pride and that's the amount of cheese I'll be using today so I'm gonna add 12 it's a 1-1 or 4 tablespoon of almond flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder I'm gonna also add a little dash of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of melted water and 1 being egg after I'm finished combining all the ingredients am I gonna add the mixture to the microwave but 90 seconds yes guys I'm using a microwavable plate because I'm gonna microwave this butter into making a bread for my pizza guys I just eyeballed two tablespoon of butter and then I'm gonna add my beaten egg and combine everything now you definitely definitely want to mix this butter pretty well because if you don't you'll have the kind of achy and you do want that for your braids so you have to mix it very very good and sure that the egg is combined with the dry ingredients all the oil is combined the other butter is combined with the dry ingredients a must be a nice smooth batter and then you just you know even it salt on the plate and ensure that it's kind of neat just for presentation because I don't know if you are like me i eated my eyes so the food must be nice looking you know guys after you're finished with this butter you're gonna pop it in the microwave for 90 second or probably based on your macro we have after it's finished it will be firm to touch and then you need to toss this in a dry pot on the stove over on both sides this is very important you want it to have a nice toasty viable to it so you just put it in a pot roast it on one side and then flip it and then choose it on

from faith rxd if you haven't checked out the podcast faith eric's podcast is absolutely brilliant he's from ireland which is somewhere i'd love to visit one day and he sent me his um cold brew so obviously coffee granules then i um there's a little process you go through it seems like a bit of a science experiment i haven't quite perfected it i've tried it a few times but i need to do it um one other time i'm actually gonna get some into the fridge now it has to stay in the fridge overnight so i'm gonna show you what the end product is in the morning time for a cappuccino first of all though this little lady who i think is nearly 16 years old who needs to go for a week oh no i need to take it with me would you like to go for a walkies walkies do i go for a walkies walkies cowanin look at donna's sexy red lead for an angel i'll see you when i get back a few moments later we have fat balls for the birds in the garden just here donna always has to come out and check what's been going on can we stop eating please i am just putting the buy psyched away and then i'm having the cappuccino but i forgot to tell you this morning i had a packet of sainsbury's chocolate corn pins because i love them had that after doing my cardio stuff and then i did two workouts which you're gonna see this week one another crossfit open prep workout that seems to have got more views on my channel for whatever reason so really cool that you guys are enjoying that kind of content and then another lockdown workout you can do at home we're just gonna kill your chest triceps and shoulders and donna has come in again to check out what's happening in the side passage do you approve of what's in here i think donna must be the nosiest dog i've ever [Applause] known i'm sorry we always seem to be accompanied by the tumble dryer but here is what i'm having for lunch on the cappuccino i made i think i've perfected it now and you only put a light dusting of chocolate on top then you put on another wadge of chocolate that's the best bit about a cappuccino here i've got 120 grams of couscous weighed up dry then 150 grams of chicken tikka slices 15 grams of cheese on top i'm not having tomatoes this time but i am going to add tomato ketchup and garlic salt no tomatoes because i'm still quite full from the burger meal time is near about quarter to six so i'm gonna have this and then not eat for probably four to five hours before i've dinner so i give it some time to digest and i'm gonna have some chocolate with this and then bring it back for when i think we are having pizza tonight the time is now half past 11 i've been chilling out a bit with the family england lost in the rugby i mean i don't follow it too closely but they still lost and then we just watched this film with tom hanks really love him as an actor favorite film with tom hanks's toy story now i'm having dinner i've been feeling a bit bloated this afternoon i think it's because i have had quite a lot of liquids and when i have quite a lot of bubbly liquid and i've had some milk as well from the cappuccino i don't feel bad just for um i just feel very bloated so i'm not potatoes this evening but here's what i'm having i'm having a couple of sausages i think these get a bad press because they're a great source of protein they are higher in fat they're a good source of fat and because i'm on a high amount of calories it's a really good way to be able to get some high calorie foods in without too much volume then i've got a nice old portion of carrots and broccoli and then here we've got i believe it's chili chicken and pancetta with cheese pizza and then a mascarpone yes mascarpone pizza interesting ham and mushroom pizza if you want to see a normal day of eating i've put it in the youtube description below so you can see what a normal day looks like and i think that's what i'm going to do for my next lean bulk full day of eating so you can actually see what i do day to day i usually film at the weekends but i have more fun food just because i have a little bit more time to be able to film i'm having this now doing some work and then i'm gonna bring you back for dessert time one eternity later and let me just jump forward by 24 hours i don't know if that's precisely it's 25 to 12 on sunday the 28th of february nearly march and it's so warm outside it felt like it was about 10 to 12 degrees celsius today which may be cold to some but that's pretty warm for this time of year in the uk i thought i'd show you my dinner for this evening as well before i show you the grand finale dessert because it'll give you a good idea of what a normal dinner looks like throughout the week because saturday is always more of a fun day of eating so i will do a an either a rest day of eating soon so i eat on a rest day or what i eat on a typical day but it's usually just quite busy on a typical day so it's quite hard to film all my meals but i'm going to try and do that for you guys here is what i'm having now i got 250 grams of vegetables stir-fry green beans and long stem broccoli then here we've got i think it's pork and apple or just pork sausage is really good then we've got plain white cod fish with a few bread crumbs and sage on top then white potato 270 grams we're gonna top this off with tomato sauce and now time for the grand dessert my desserts are evolving it's been a few days but my desserts have changed slightly and i want to take you through now and explain about how i've changed my approach is slightly to dessert it hasn't changed at all but i'm starting to incorporate some slightly higher fatty foods which are a little bit higher in protein and are still very enjoyable to eat here is what my dessert stash looks like at the moment we have got chocolate baklava and normal baklavas so the one in the middle and just here at the bottom they are the standard ones then you get um a chocolatey one on the right here milk chocolate with an almond on top that's a really nice one dark chocolate ones i think they've got dark chocolate blended within the blood carver which isn't so nice but clover is basically honey pastry and pistachio nutty goodness then underneath i'm starting to incorporate more greek style yogurt but the full fat stuff so the zero percent stuff is roughly 55 calories and approximately seven half grams of protein per hundred grams the full fat stuff is about four grams of protein and 124 calories per hundred grams it is thicker and it does taste a little bit nicer but for me it's definitely better having the lower fat stuff with the higher protein content but this is really good for me um to mix in with some milk chocolate powder just so i can get the calories in and it tastes pretty good i'm also incorporating some chocolate peanuts because what i call breakfall nuts i do like chocolate peanuts fish bash bosch that's why i've got this really good for the calories i'm not having this for dessert but we mum got this the other day it's 30 packs of crisps six bacon six roast chicken six beef and onions six ready salted six cheese and onion for a ridiculously low price so good then over here got some more protein bars from noodle incorporate some more pano chocolate and then lightly fruited cake from lidl 500 grams for 99 pence absolute bargain and then in here i've got some strawberry cheesecakes and some toffee cheesecakes don't know why mum got some lime eclairs the other day so it's lime with chocolate in the middle that's horrible no idea why somebody want to do that so my desserts at the moment is usually a bowl of cereal then some full fat greek yogurt i still have some cake and ice cream and then maybe some baklava stuff and some chocolate peanuts if you want to check out a normal full day of eating i'll put it in the youtube description what it looks like the layout and the macros and the protein and stuff and the calories just so you know what a normal day and i think that's gonna be my next full day of lean bulking what i eat in a normal day so you can see what i typically eat to support my training and what i do around my personal training sessions because it could be quite hard to sit down to eat during the day i don't normally do that hope you guys enjoyed this one make sure you give this video a like subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and i look forward to seeing you in my next video", "oQ7ojF6Uf4o": "hey guys welcome back to my channel i'm myra from low carb love and today we're going to be making fettuccine egg noodles so this is a super super low carb noodle and of course it's made with egg and i'm going to show you this is something that you can use while doing an egg fast and if you're not into egg fast then this is just a great noodle substitute so i've been doing this here in the air for about two years and honestly it's super delicious super low in carbs and you guys are gonna love it so now we're going to get started with our eggs it's always best if they are room temperature so four of these little bad boys okay we have two ounces of softened cream cheese we just put this in the microwave for like 30 seconds we're gonna throw that right in then we have a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder about an eighth teaspoon of pepper this is more to taste but i'm doing an eighth and about an eighth of salt okay so now let's go ahead and mix this i whisk that for about one minute on a medium high speed okay okay so now we're gonna spray our little baking pan it's just a little bit of avocado oil this just helps the parchment paper actually stick okay and now we spray the parchment paper so this doesn't stick and we pour right in okay this is just such an easy um noodle substitute and i personally love it okay and make sure that your oven is preheated to 350 degrees we're gonna get this in there okay so now we're gonna go ahead and bake this for 15 minutes we're gonna get started with our sauce this is our alfredo sauce it's super simple we have a third cup of heavy cream i'm just gonna pour that in we have two ounces of cream cheese we're actually just gonna pour everything in one tablespoon of butter okay a quarter cup of parmesan cheese so this is like a blend with asiago and parmesan but you can totally um use all parmesan and an eighth of minced garlic you can use them an eighth to a fourth okay teaspoon and let's go to the stove and heat this up we're gonna make our sauce okay so now we're just melting our sauce i'm adding a little pepper this is just to taste if you don't like pepper then obviously don't use it so as you can tell this is nice and thick if you'd like it a little less thick you can just add some water or almond milk okay so let's get our little future noodles out that's what it's going to look like okay now i'm going to show you how we're going to turn this into noodles okay so we're just going to [Music] put this onto a cutting board okay so now we're just going to cut little strips and we're making them a little thicker because this is more like fettuccine this is like a fettuccine substitute okay so now i've finished cutting my noodles now if you want like a really thin noodle all you need to do is get a bigger a bigger baking sheet so it's going to be a little more difficult to cut but it's totally totally doable i personally like it like this so that's why i make it in like my smaller and my smaller pan but what we're gonna do is so i'm just gonna pick them up just like so and we're gonna put them onto our plate and then we are going to plate it with the sauce and all that good stuff okay so now we're just gonna toss it here are noodles with our sauce i'm gonna add a tiny bit of pepper okay i'm also gonna add some chili flakes this is obviously totally optional but you know if you're about that spicy life then you can totally add some i love love love adding broccoli so i do have some broccoli here but of course if you're doing an egg fast then you're not gonna have broccoli but if you're just having like dinner and you want chicken and broccoli then of course you would add you know a bunch of chicken and broccoli okay so i ended up adding some broccoli to my dish as you can see this looks just like pasta and wait until you try it you're going to be blown away so i have one noodle here it's kind of a little thick one but remember all you have to do is um use a bigger pan a baking sheet and then they will be a lot thinner i personally like them like this so cheers [Music] this tastes just like pasta of course the texture is not like as thick you know like as dense but it's delicious and the sauce is everything okay guys so i hope you really enjoyed this recipe it's super simple remember it's super low carb honestly there isn't a pasta out there that is lowering carbs unless it's like shirataki but i'm not about that life so this is so much better um you can also of course use zoodles and there's like an edamame pasta that i also like let me know if you guys want me to show you um like my substitutes maybe i can uh create like a video of all my favorite substitutes for from high carb to low carb so comment down below and let me know but yeah this is how i will be eating this um the only thing that i would say you can add would be chicken but other than that this is perfection so i hope you really enjoy this recipe once you make it come back and let me know um what you think of it and of course if you want a little more of me make sure you're following me on instagram and tick tock low carb love and make sure that your post notifications are turned on so that you don't miss any of my future videos guys i hope you really enjoy this thank you for being here with me and i will see you on my next video alright guys so if you've stayed this long on the video i wanted to actually talk to you a little bit about pasta substitutes because of course that's one of the things that we miss the most when we go low carb so there are a few options um i didn't think i actually wanted to film an entire video on pasta substitutes let me know if you want me to actually do that because then i will order all the substitutes that are low carb and keto friendly and then we can do like a taste test or somehow like give you all the info and the rundown on low carb pasta number one just because i tend to have more of a sensitive stomach and sometimes like if something's not gluten free like these here that i'm going to talk about right now i feel like i might have a little bit of an intolerance to gluten so i always love going with a zoodle it's the cleanest you can eat them daily you know they're not going to kick you out of ketosis they're going to if you have like a sensitivity to gluten they're going to be perfect super low in calories low in carbs the whole shebang so zoodles are definitely my number one choice and i personally love them then we have these here i don't have a discount code for any of these these are just little things that i purchased along the way um this one here is by great low carb this is more of a pasta rice or like oil i've never tried this one to be honest it just came in like the variety pack so i don't know about that one but this one here is so this is a penne but the macaroni is actually really good so they're not they are not i repeat they are not gluten free but they're low in carbs so it's kind of you know you just kind of have to wait out this is something that i would have more on a treat like if i'm making mac and cheese which i don't make too often then that's where i would throw in um like a pasta like this one here because again it has gluten um it's not really dirty i would just say it has you know you want to stay away from gluten because you want to keep your diet you know on the cleaner side if you're trying to if you're on a weight loss journey if you're not and you're just maintaining then you know whatever whatever you like that keeps you in you know on track then it's fine so this is just shirataki with added oat fiber let me know if you've tried this one so this one here i'll tell you it's 15 calories zero sugar zero fat keto certified it has four grams of carbs but it's three of fiber so at the end of the day it's um yeah it's super super clean so shirataki if you like it then this might be a good option again i haven't tried it so this is the laviva let me know if you've tried it and um what your thoughts are on that this here this is a tom yum shrimp so this is kind of like a ramen noodle like a cup of noodles um i made it for nothing nothing was down with it she put lemon tapatio and she was like mom it's good so um this here is another noodle substitute that has it's made with pumpkin seed protein wheat gluten so again it's not gluten free and um fava bean protein so if you guys want to check these out um this is in me in me so this is what i have on hand i didn't have much but i figured i would show you what i have and more or less like my thoughts on on a low carb keto pasta my recommendation or my tip try to stick to natural vegetables so i hope you enjoyed this little um this little clip and um yeah give me your give me your opinion let me know which is your favorite pasta and i'd love to i'd love to hear", "x65KhC2z4Ig": "good morning everyone it is I I'm gonna be doing some Jamaican patties this morning instead of being beef I'm gonna be doing a plant-based version with lentils and mushrooms as my meat I'm also going to be using garlic fresh thyme scallion red onion and all these spices the Himalayan sea salt will be used for the crust the jerk seasoning will be used mostly to substitute for the hold Scotch vodka pepper so it's not too hot curry powder which is mostly turmeric for the crust as well to give it at yellow color oxtail seasoning which will give more of those like pimento or allspice kind of flavors too it's really nice and for my crust I'm gonna use cake flour which does not have sugar in it it's just a lighter flour compared to like wheat or garbanzo bean flour which are the alternatives I've been using lately but I want to use something a little bit lighter so it can be flaky and I'm using solidified coconut oil as my fat for that flaky crust I already have my cleaned and dried baking pan with my silicone baking sheet and I'm gonna walk you through the process no music this time just gonna be me talking but I'm going to show you how I do things a lot of my recipes actually come about by substitutions just because I do eat more plant-based even though I I have occasionally been eating fish but since I've been home for this self quarantine self distancing thing I've basically just been eating vegan but I still want to make sure I cover all my bases in terms of food groups and make sure it's still nutritious and tastes very good because we don't like eating out anymore so yeah so stay with me I'm gonna show you how to make all this so as I told you the flour I'm using is cake flour these are the ingredients it's basically unbleached flour wheat barley wheat starch and those are some of the nutrition facts if you hear a noise in the background ask my husband he's making a mess so yeah so we have carbohydrates but there's zero uh total sugars and no added sugar so it's basically just flour and I don't have like measuring cups per se but this is like a small bowl I'm if I was to guess I would say just about a cup to a cup and a half of flour and I'm gonna go ahead and add that to my bowl okay and then I'm gonna get my fat ready to the flour I've added for measuring tablespoons of my fat which is the coconut oil this one Publix bran and I'm going to clean my hands of course work that back into the oil then add my salt my curry powder and need that together into a dough alright so now we have our dough the dough has the cake flour and the coconut oil the salt and the curry powder and place the curry powder you could just use plain turmeric I use this one because I like the flavors that go with it and this is what it looks like I'm so excited because the last time I made this it didn't even look nearly this color I did add one full tablespoon of the curry powder I'll just show you the ingredients on the back where do we have the ingredients right here so there's turmeric is the first ingredient it's mostly yellow there's also coriander cumin salt allspice black pepper garlic and the rest we have going on there I did use one full tablespoon so I used very little like a pinch of salt from the Himalayan sea salt and I worked it in I would say when it comes to the fat you could probably use less fat I was just putting in what I thought would be appropriate I used four measure tablespoons you could probably use to maybe use three just kind of gauge it for the water I initially use maybe a little too much like to add more flour but I used up to right here for water okay so like maybe a third of this container and I ended up adding more flour just to make it a little less wet right so this is not wet and it's a little sticky but it's basically a regular dough so I'm gonna let this sit before I get started I'm gonna work on my meat in quotes so this will probably sit for about fifteen to thirty minutes room temperature I'm just gonna cover it with a paper towel and then I'll go on to the next part of the dish all right to my food processor I've added three ingredients there are I don't know if you can see garlic you probably can't see it but I put all the mushrooms there's the red onion and garlic since I have a small food processor I'm gonna do these in stages I'm gonna blend this up or chop it fine and then put it in this container and then I'm gonna do the scallion and tomato next mix them all together and then I'm going to brown them in my pan here and then I'll add the spices I'm gonna cook the time in with the mixture but I'm gonna pull out the stems before I put it with the dome okay so we don't have sticks in our food all right so I'm gonna go ahead and blend this I'll show you the next step so that's my blended garlic mushroom and onion and then this is the scallion and the tomato so I'm gonna blend that mix that together seasoned it in the pot at the time and we're gonna get cooking oh my stars I still wish you get to smell this kitchen right now this is my mushroom garlic scallion tomato and red onion I'm cooking it in olive oil haven't added any ex places yet I have my lentils back there and I'm also gonna add the fresh thyme and the spices so hang in there guys we're getting through so here is my dough on the lightly floured glass cutting board same flour I use to make it I'm gonna roll that out and I'm gonna show you the next part of the dish this is my meat or protein fix meat so this is the mushrooms but I also added the lentils and the spices and the spices consisted of the jerk spice curry powder and I added I think it was the oxtail seasoning so that's simmering with all the you know garlic and scallions tomato and red onion and the mushrooms and cooking it in olive oil the heat is a little less than medium just letting that simmer slowly and then I'm gonna go ahead and roll out my dough okay guys this is my last patty what I did was took the original dough had it in a ball cut it into four pieces then I rolled out those four pieces and then cut each of those pieces in half so that's what you're seeing here this is one of the pieces cut in half and what I did was add just a thin layer it's not much just a thin layer of my meat mixture I'm gonna roll over okay so roll it over and then press with a fork to get these indentations so press with a fork and then cut around and cut off the excess so that's how I did this there's tons of video showing how to do that on youtube I just didn't want to do that and then have to go back and forth with the phone so I'm just showing you what it looks like I have seven of them done so five over here - over there I missed the last one that's eight and I'm gonna roll this press it and cut it and go ahead and get in the oven stay tuned alright so I have put together all the patties I put them on the baking dishes I didn't want to overcrowd the pan so I did a second one and I have the oven it's been on 400 for quite some time just so it's nice and hot so I'm gonna put them in the oven and I'll probably have them in there for about 30 to 35 minutes the inside is cooked I just want the dough to be cooked I'm praying that it's flaky and delicious it looks good so far so yeah let me pop them in there and show you the finished result all right everyone the patties are done a few things that I've noticed that I would recommend for those of you who are trying this recipe is possibly use less time or reduce the temperature I had my oven preheated basically on bake for basically the whole time I was preparing this it was quite hot at 400 degrees and then I put it in and spec like an expecting to be like 30 to 35 minutes actually pulled these out at 30 and pulled these out at like 30 to 33 minutes I'm not sure why these are darker because they went in at the same time it was actually more crowded if I'll just cut off that part over here that part but they're not sticking to the pan they're fully cooked and I don't know if you can see I'm just gonna zoom in a little bit feels a little bubbles bubbles in the dough okay and over here that's gonna that's gonna be like that layering as because of the fact that's in the flour so I know who's gonna be flaky and delicious so again when you're doing this I would recommend using a lower temperature when you're actually baking maybe like 350 to 375 or reduce the time anywhere from 25 to 30 minutes or less depending on what feeling you have so yeah so this is what we have I'm gonna cut off those darker brown parts and I'm going to get into this patty cut it open so you can see what it looks like all right so I'm gonna do this on camera with you look at that it's very very light okay so that that crust is very thin I look at the filling oh my gosh I'm starving and we're kind of greedy so we're gonna get started eating but ideally you should let this sit before you open it up but look at that so good alright so this is the one that was extra brown and I all I did was just cut off that part so this would be for me we don't waste anything around here so it's not burnt you said that that crispy part was extra brown but as you can see it still held together I am so happy with the way this turned out just because the first time I made it it didn't look anything like this it was very pale and also it was very tough and thick so this one I know if you can appreciate that it's very light and I think that that definitely comes from the flour we use cake flour and we use a true fat and not just oil solidified coconut oil it doesn't taste like coconut at all it just has that flakiness that you want which is why you use fat with the flour okay so try this recipe you will not be disappointed", "cCMDZfYPDvc":

are not already subscribed that you hit that subscribe button and notification bell right down below and now let's go ahead and get into it alright guys so when you make chicken with 40 cloves of garlic you actually need 40 cloves of garlic and it's so funny every time I make this dish for a group of people I always get two questions one can I have some more peas and - do you really need 40 clothes yes this recipe has been around way before I was even thought being born so I don't rock the boat I just make it the way it's supposed to be made so forty close of garlic is going to equal about three to four actual heads of garlic that'll give you about 40 cloves I went ahead and peeled mine last night put them in a container and pop them in the refrigerator you can also get already peeled garlic in the grocery store in your produce section and it's fine if you want to use those but your mine we're gonna put those aside and we're gonna go ahead and get started on the chicken here I have 8 bone-in chicken thighs that I have already thoroughly washed and pat dry with the paper towel I'm just gonna sprinkle some salt and pepper on these make sure that you do both sides nobody likes chicken that's only seasoned on one side [Music] all right and I have some olive oil and a little bit of butter heating up and my cast-iron skillet we're gonna go ahead get these in the pan Brown them on both sides about two to three minutes per side you're gonna do skin side first and let's go ahead and pop these in the pan you want to put your chicken in the pan skin side down first and you may have to do this in batches you don't want to overcrowd your pan after two to three minutes go ahead and turn your chicken over and brown the other side now after you're done browning your chicken set that aside turn your heat down low on your pan and then we're just going to add in our garlic we're gonna let that cook for about one minute do not burn your garlic now after you've let your garlic cook for a minute turn the heat off and add your chicken back to the pan [Music] now you just want to sprinkle in some fresh rosemary and thyme we're going to cover this and put this in a preheated 400 degree oven for 20 minutes now after our chicken has been in the oven for 20 minutes we are going to take it out of the oven and we are just going to get some of that juice that it's made and put it all over our chicken now once you baste it your chicken you're going to put your lid back on and pop this back into the oven for 30 minutes all right you guys our chicken is out of the oven and look at how fabulous this is now what you want to do is go ahead and take your chicken pieces and put them into a separate dish and cover that lightly with some foil to make sure it stays warm now you just want to mash a couple or more of your garlic we're going to turn our heat on low and we're going to add in our white wine we're gonna let this cook down for a minute or two because we want to cook off the alcohol make sure that you scrape up any of those yummy Brown that are on the bottom of the pan that just adds to the flavor once your wine it's been cooking for two to three minutes go ahead and add in your chicken stock and we want to reduce this so let it cook for about five minutes [Music] all right so now you just want to take a piece of that delicious chicken and some of that sauce make sure you get a few cloves of garlic on there mmm and I like to serve mine with some nice toasted bread or baguette because you want to be able to dip that bread in that sauce all right guys let's go ahead and take a little taste of it I've been waiting for this yeah if you don't make this tonight for this week I don't know what you're doing with your life this is the business now I always like to take a little bit of bread get some of that I'm gonna sauce fantastic now if you're thinking this is going to have an overwhelming flavor of garlic it's absolutely not when the garlic roast in the oven for that long if you velop it's a really nice sweet subtle flavor it's absolutely delicious now as always the ingredients will be listed down below you can find the directions on our website at delightful and delicious calm I'll leave a link to that down below as well I hope you guys try this please please do this is so so good and it's super easy to do now remember the next time you two are in the kitchen you're keeping it delightful and delicious see you next time guys bye [Music]", "TbYx-ps3qQo": "Kito pizza in ten minutes is what we've got on tap today I did a keto pizza recipe about a year ago I did ate that head pizza recipe you guys love that recipe but the pizza I'm about to show you today I think is the best keto pizza recipe and I think that for a couple of reasons because number one the crust on this keto pizza is just so much like a normal pizza crust and then number two it's just way easier than making a fat head pieces like I said this is a ten minute pizza recipe at least less than ten minutes bake time total time you're looking at probably fifteen minutes so it's just the easiest pizza ever to make with that being said let's get in this one and make some delicious quick keto pizza alright so the first thing we want to do is preheat the oven to 425 degrees next we want to prep some these keto Pizza ingredients in advance so in a small dish we're gonna add somewhere between three quarters of a cup to a cup of mozzarella cheese and that works out to be 84 to a hundred and twelve grams depending on how much cheese you like on your keto pizza next we're gonna prep the pizza sauce and as you're seeing here the sauce I went with is hunts and this stuff is great for keto pizza because not only does it have just two net carbs per serving but it has no sugar added to it as well anyways for today's keto pizza recipe I think be perfect amount of pizza sauce is about a half a cup or 125 grams so that's the amount that I'm gonna add to my food scale and the last thing we're gonna prep out is gonna be some coconut oil and today we're using a tablespoon or 14 grams of that for our keto pizza alright so now that all that prep work is done we're just gonna start weighing out all the dry ingredients for our keto Pizza the first drag routine we're adding is going to be almond flour I like this one by kirklands it's cheap and it only has two net carbs per serving so we're gonna add a cup and a half which is a hundred and sixty eight grams of that stuffed or Bowl and the next ingredient we're gonna add is going to be some unflavored whey protein and the reason we're adding this is because it's a great way to lower not only the carb count in the keto pizza but also the calories and the keto Pizza as well because we won't have to add as much almond flour by the way guys I know that protein powder isn't everybody's things so if you don't want to use the protein powder check the video description below for instructions on how you can replace it with that being said I'm adding two thirds of a scoop or 20 grams of the unflavored whey protein powder for my pizza crust today so once we've added that we're gonna add some coconut flour and do not replace this with more almond flour also do not use more of this than I'm using in today's recipe basically just use the amount of coconut flour that I'm using for my keto pizza crust today and that is two tablespoons or 15 grams of it so once you've added that the next thing you want to add is a half a teaspoon of xanthan gum a half a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt a pinch of garlic powder and a pinch of onion powder at this point we've got all the dry ingredients added for our keto pizza crust so we'll just whisk if i \u00f4ll them together until they're combined and then we'll start adding the wet ingredients so first off we're gonna quickly melt the coconut oil that we prepped out from earlier and then we're gonna add that to the bowl and then we're also gonna add some eggs more specifically we're adding two large eggs for today's keto pizza now at this point you'll want to take out a spatula and combine the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and you'll want to do this until a crumbly ball of dough forms once it does that's when you want to roll up your sleeves and start working the ball of dough with your hands until it becomes smooth and the yolks from the eggs fully incorporate with the other ingredients when the yolks fully dissolve into the other ingredients that's when you want to get out some parchment paper add the ball of keto pizza dough to it and then you want to cover the keto pizza dough with another sheet of parchment paper and the reason we're doing this is because as you're seeing here it makes it much easier to roll out the dough also the keto pizza dough won't stick to your rolling pin when you're rolling out the dough this way either so once you roll out the keto pizza dough to roughly about a 14 by 14 inch diameter that's when you want to remove the top layer of parchment paper and start rolling up the edges of the keto pizza dough to form a crust and just so you guys know what you're aiming for when you roll up the crust you want your pizza to be about 12 inches in diameter anyways when you got your pizza crust looking good that's when you want to transfer it to a pizza tray and bake it in the oven for three to four minutes if you're using the protein powder version or about five minutes if you're just using straight almond flour however keep an eye on it because this Kido pizza crust bakes quick and it's done just when the edges of the crust start to turned golden brown anyways when the crust comes out of the oven that's we're gonna add the sauce that we prepped from earlier along with the cheese and any toppings that you want to add as well today I went with regular pepperoni for my keto pizza but whatever toppings you want to use for your keto pizza is totally up to you so now at this point when you've got all your toppings added you want to switch over your oven to a boil and then you want to broil the keto pizza for about three and a half minutes or until the cheese just totally melts once that happens the pizza is done you want to remove it from the oven cut it into eight slices and then check this out this is how it ends up looking it is seriously the best keto pizza recipe I hope you guys enjoy it if you want more information about today's recipe check the video description below and I'll see you in the next one", "XXZYcxZpQEg": "hi welcome to my channel Dahle antique my name is alia I'm Lewbert today's recipe is one of my favourite grandmother's recipe cut aluminum nom means bread and cut the Monon it's like with a lot of layers when you travel it's very easy to bring it with you and we serve Katipunan with salad and in the summer with grapes and sometimes with watermelon so it's very very delicious my whole kitchen smells like my grandmother's kitchen ok let's begin for the non recipe we will need flour salt warm water lamb with a lot of pads onions and cumin first of all put salt and warm water into the flour begin with Canadian when you don't see the dry flour anymore and as a jaw feels smooth it's ready to rest for 15 to 20 minutes this is what the lamb that I'm using looks like this is leftover lamb fat with fuel needs the fat makes the non juicy I cut the meat in very small pieces put the pan on the biggest fire when it's hot enough put in the lamb mix it and let it simmer cut the onion very finely and mix it with the lamb after that put the salt cumin white and black pepper ends when they have a golden brown color bring the pan to the smallest fire in the meanwhile and preparing for the salad I use beans thread noodles and I put it in the hot water for 3 to 5 minutes I use herb such as white pepper black pepper salt and vinegar vegetables such as onion radish garlic hot red chili pepper coriander scallion sweet red pepper and carrots I cut carrots very thin in long sections and put them in boiling water for 20 seconds I fried the garlic and onion in a tiny bit of olive oil put the vegetables and fried garlic and onion into a pan add the herbs and mix all the ingredients very gently and carefully by hand after about 20 minutes the dough is ready to go I divided the dough in five sections the size of each one is about 1 hand roll them in your hands make them wrong keep them on the road towel the towel prevents the dough from becoming dry I'm going to begin with the first piece of dough put some flour on the dough and on the table the next step is rolling the dough with a rolling pin if the dough sticks on the rolling pin you need to use more flour [Music] the more the door become thinner and bigger you will see the door turtles here don't panic it's fine now you are going to use the meat as a stuffing spread the meat evenly on the tool and try to cover all the dough with me and pass the new finish you can roll up the door [Music] you just hold the soul in hell and swish this until the door begin to tear repeat this process again set the twisted door up straight and slowly flatten it from the top downs [Music] make the door as even as possible put it in the pan you use for the meat and fry it on both sides when it's done finish the rest of the dough [Music] thank you so much for watching this video and I hope you try this recipe at home and when you make hot lemon and don't forget to use hashtags Dolan chicks hot lemon and so I

you put some curry powder and you're done no just no let's explore this one together before we actually talk about that let's discuss the Krispy Kreme by better a lot of people think that my donut was not as good as Krispy Kremes because I made the donut hole you noticed fine but you can have it I shouldn't let that happen that was very stupid the point is I want you to understand that there's gonna be a rematch and I will make sure that it is but until then we're gonna just gonna have to wait on though okay so we're making chicken tikka masala these but this is a more spiced version there's definitely still cream there's definitely still butter and there's definitely still Tomatoes but it's the spicing anyway with that said let's make this shall we okay so we need to start off by spicing things up with literal spices first get a small pan and add one tablespoon or four grams of coriander seeds along with half a teaspoon or one gram of cumin seeds keep that bad boy over medium heat tossing often until fragrant and toasted about two minutes remove from the pan and let them spicy boys cool for a little bit in a blender add your spices slap around in there a little bit until as fine as possible then add seven cloves of garlic a two inch knob of fresh peeled ginger 1 tablespoon or seven grams of garam masala 1 TSP or 3 grams of turmeric powder and 2 red Fresno or Birds Eye Chili's stems removed obviously lastly a quarter cup of water then go ahead and begin blending this you'll need to use your trusty blender plunger if you have one to help get it smooth once it's mostly smooth go and drizzle in two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of canola oil while blending now keep on blending until nicely incorporated and smooth remember this ain't no chunky salsa it's your curry paste as smooth as possible ok so before we get started on the actual curry gravy let's give this chickie a little yogurt bath but look this is a crucial step please don't skip this or I'll be family angry with you so first cut 2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs tongue twister into bite-size pieces in a bowl mix together 1 cup or 250 5 grams of whole milk yogurt 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of your tikka masala paste and two teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt then toss your chicken in the yogurt mixture cover with plastic wrap and let marinate for 20 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator now obviously we're gonna serve this curry with rice but please do me a favor I really gonna note this if you don't wash your rice its time no more procrastinating please I am begging you please rinse and drain it at least two to three times before cooking I know a lot of people know this but look I cooked my bath body with a one to one ratio of water to rice and some cardamom pubs in a pressure cooker at high pressure for 6 minutes and then a natural release for 8 minutes or some mad good Baz Maggi bros to make the funnel curry blend one 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes past that period mixture through a sieve and place up to the satoru nee now heat a large saute pan or a medium sized pot over medium-high heat with enough oil to coat the bottom syria chicken on both sides till nicely brown about 3 to 4 minutes each side and placed it aside as well now once all your chicken is seared and you have a nice little fond in the bottom of your pan reduce the heat to medium and add 4 tablespoons or 56 grams of unsalted butter once it's hot and bubbly add one large diced sweet onion let that cook until the onion begins to turn translucent then add all of your remaining tikka masala paste plus 1 tablespoon or seven grams of paprika and 1 teaspoon or two grams of Kashmiri chilli powder cook that stirring often until the pace begins to stick to the bottom of the pan then add your pureed tomatoes stir nicely and bring that up to a simmer over medium heat let that simmer for about 10 minutes stirring occasionally until it becomes thickened and then finally you can add one and a quarter cup or 300 millilitres of heavy cream mix until thoroughly combined add your chicken back to the pan as well coated in the sauce and bring that back up to a simmer simmer an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thickened velvety smooth and gorgeous season that to taste with salt and serve alongside some lovely steamed basmati rice garnish with fresh cilantro and now we must first pass this dish with a trial by fire and by fire I mean in my mouth and by my mouth I mean I'm gonna eat it right so proper spoon tikka masala let's go brav that's how you know it's real silver right [Music] Wow I mean come on you gotta be joking me with this Fisher's out of all the parties you could be making this is easily going to be one of the best that you ever make in your life Wow for one my rice is cooked perfectly all right I may be white but I can cook directly okay you get the point this is ridiculous how perfect this tastes a little spicy a little bit of sweetness from the tomato all the flavors meld together exactly what you want and more of its creamy perfectly the rice the texture ah that's a ten so okay okay but do you wanna know what else is so good [Music] alright guys and that is it so we made chicken tikka masala I think it turned out honestly I don't to use the word perfect but pretty darn close to that he heard look I may be white okay but I do try to stay as close culturally as I can to the right way of doing it in terms of tradition I'm using a couple different things to do this it's the prior knowledge that I've learned from other chefs on the basics of curry and then also just in general some flavors that I personally feel balancing wise makes sense in this recipe that's my personal tape the haters are gonna come in you are welcome and entitled to that opinion but I will say that it is delicious so that's the word bro there are some crazy things in the works right now god I wish I could talk about all of it you're gonna see in the coming weeks and months and years but man the amount of opportunities that you guys have afforded me is is it's just absolutely shocking honestly to say the least so I just want to say I used to say this all the time and I haven't said it as much recently but I'm always thinking about it I'm just so grateful for you guys very very thankful for all these opportunities I want to make sure that you guys know that I'm constantly thinking about this honestly I don't say this much because you see boy hours but thank you from bottom I heart much more

tastes the best February and March is the early spring and a coat so it's traditional to eat some greens that are classified as warm according to traditional Chinese medicine Chinese chive is perfect for the season choose the one with feather leaves will be more tasty and pair with someone Mnet's and it will make it more nutritious it's really easy to cook this dish and you would just need some oil and a salt optionally you can add some sugar first wash the chive and drain the water then cutting two short sections quickly rings the walnuts as well and a paper towel dry turn the heat to medium-low and add about 1/2 TSP of oil and the walnuts stir fry for about 2-3 minutes until it turns to golden brown then put the walnuts aside then turn the heat to high and add another 1/2 TSP of oil then stir-fry the Chinese chai for one to two minutes then adding a pinch of salt then adding the walnuts and a pinch of sugar then gently mix them and you are all done if you do have some toasted

so [Music] you", "Vkwee-a-tlc": "Hey, guys. Today on\nLow Carb with Jennifer, we are going to be making keto hummus. So, today we're going to\nbe making keto hummus. And usually, hummus is\nmade out of chickpeas, which are garbanzo beans that are boiled or canned or whatever. But a good alternative to that is steamed cauliflower, and I'm going to tell you right now, this is exactly like hummus. What makes hummus the\nflavor that it is, is tahini and tahini is sesame-seed paste. So, right now, I've already steamed the cauliflower. I just bought the bags\nof frozen cauliflower in the freezer section\nat the grocery store, and I steamed them in the microwave. So, this is two bags, it's about three cups\nof cauliflower florets. So, we are going to add our\nhummus ingredients into here. Our first ingredient is some olive oil, which is essential for delicious hummus. All of these ingredients are\nessential for delicious hummus. Which, of course, would mean cumin. Ground cumin and ground garlic. But now, we've got to put in the tahini, which is, like I said\nbefore, sesame-seed paste. It is what gives cauliflower... I mean, not cauliflower. It's what gives hummus its flavor, along with lemon juice. So, I'm going to go ahead and start to pulse this. (whirring) I'm going to scrape down the sides. This is so easy and it tastes just like hummus. I'm also going to add in some water, and this just helps it smooth it out and bring it all together. It's like the secret\ningredient for smooth hummus. Also, if you don't have... Actually, a blender\nwould work really good, a high-speed blender like a Vitamix. I don't have one of those here, so I have this Ninja food processor. It works good, but I think the Vitamix works better. (whirring) Scrape the sides again. I'm going to taste it. Needs salt. That is pretty smooth. For cauliflower hummus. So now, we can spoon it into a bowl. Okay, I'm going to spoon this into a bowl. Serve it up. This is so good served with... This makes a lot of hummus, by the way. And you can freeze it easily. But this is so good served with pork rinds or I like to eat it with pieces of salami. So good. Okay, let me put some olive oil on there. Isn't that beautiful? And lookee here, I've got some pork rinds. Let me dip one in. Guys, you've got to check out this recipe. Oh. It's so good, especially after it\nsits in the refrigerator and the tahini firms back up, and it's exactly like Trader Joe's hummus. Guys, be sure you check out this video where I did a Trader Joe's haul and I gave you four recipe ideas for lunch and meal prep. So, check that out and I will see you guys later. Bye.", "Sh21IFve18Q": "hey there it's steve from serious keto and in this video we are gonna make a keto hummus with one-third the net carbs of traditional chickpea hummus a couple of weeks ago i was approached by a small startup called aviate foods all they do is lupini lately it seems that lupin lupin flour ground lupine beans or lupini has been kind of a hot topic in the keto world and for good reason first off very very low net carbs for example these lupini flakes which i'm going to use in this video in one quarter cup you have 11 grams of total carbohydrates of that 10 grams is dietary fiber so just one gram of net carbs per quarter cup not only is lupini keto friendly i've actually read an article that says it may help improve type 2 diabetes so bonus there the problem is that most of the lupine flower or lupine flower that i've used so far has got sort of a earthy even bitter sort of an edge to it enough so that you need to cut it with some other sort of flour almond flour coconut flour etc not so with this stuff from aviate foods i don't know what particular variety of lupini beans these are where they're sourced any of that stuff but what i can tell you is both the flour and the flakes have virtually none of that bitterness that you usually find in lupine or lupini now one very important note before we get going if you have a peanut allergy you should not eat lupini beans they are very close cousins on the food scale so if you have an issue with peanuts lupini is not for you as always the printable recipe along with all macros will be linked to down in the description below now let's make some hummus we will start with three cups of water that is 710 mil well then add one quarter teaspoon of baking soda this not only further reduces any slight bitterness that there might be in the lupini it also makes it easier to blend later on we'll bring this to a boil and stir in our baking soda once we've reached a boil we'll add our lupini flakes one cup or 120 grams we'll boil our lupini flakes for three to four minutes if it looks like it's going to foam over you may want to reduce the heat just a little bit but we're going to want to stir constantly i'm using a 1.5 quart saucepan here and i'm kind of pushing my luck i'm right near the edge after about four minutes that foam is going to die down we'll turn off our heat and then strain our lupine through a fine mesh strainer we'll then let it cool while we prep some of our other ingredients for this recipe we will use the juice of one lemon you can use fresh lemon or bottled but if using fresh you can also take that zest off of it and use it a little bit later as a garnish i use my microplane upside down like this so that i can collect all the zest it's a lot cleaner that way we'll set the lemon aside for later and scoop our zest down into a bowl see how tidy that is and we'll save that for later too for this recipe you can use either jarred minced garlic or fresh garlic we're going to use fresh we'll crush them a little bit with the side of a knife that helps the skin come off and then i cut off the little ends here the stem ends then we'll thinly slice both cloves and set these aside for later we will dump our mostly drained lupini flakes into a food processor then we will add the juice of our lemon if using bottled lemon juice i would say two to three tablespoons that's 30 to 45 mil depending on how citrusy you like your hummus next we will add one third of a cup or about 80 grams of tahini now i found that some brands of tahini can be a little bit bitter i'll talk about how to counter that at the end of this video also any tools that i use including this variable measuring cup i will link to down in the description below scrape this off right here next we will add 2 tablespoons or about 30 ml of extra virgin olive oil we'll then add our garlic either two cloves or one teaspoon minced one quarter teaspoon of smoked paprika and then we're going to add some cumin you can either use seed or ground if ground use one quarter teaspoon we're going to use seed but we're going to grind it up in a mortar and pestle one quarter teaspoon along with one teaspoon of kosher salt now if you like cumin you are gonna love the smell of this it takes about a minute to grind it up but it really unleashes an incredible incredible smell and flavor and we will dump that into our food processor get every last bit of it here and scrape off that stuff off that little center bit now we will process this for 30 seconds and then scrape down the sides to this we will add one quarter cup of ice cold water and we will process again for about another 30 seconds once again scrape down the sides then we're going to give this a little bit of a taste if you find that there's any sort of residual bitterness either from the tahini or from the lupini you can counter that with five to ten drops of liquid stevia i find that this doesn't taste very bitter to me so i'm just gonna put in i don't know four or five drops and one final time we will process for another 30 seconds look at how smooth that is we will transfer this to a bowl at this point the hummus may still seem a little bit soupy don't worry about that it's going to firm right up once we refrigerate this for about a half an hour that's where it's going to go right now after a half hour you can see how this is firmed up quite a bit so now we're going to garnish it there are pretty much infinite possibilities for garnishing whether you want to do roasted pine nuts feta cheese i'm going to start with a little bit of paprika here then i'm going to sprinkle on a little bit of ground cumin some parsley flake for color then i've got that lemon zest from before which will give this a little more color as well as a citrus brightness and finally i'll drizzle it with a little more extra virgin olive oil now you can serve this with one of my keto cracker recipes or celery which is what i'm going to do you know you could probably do pork rinds too if you want but i'm doing celery now i'll tell you i have made this with both the pre-minced jarred garlic and the fresh garlic fresh garlic really brings the garlic so if you're not so into garlic and you're using fresh maybe dial back to just one clove and in terms of the spices and herbs and garnishes on this you can absolutely make this recipe your own have some fun with it i tell you what why don't we see what my grandson colton thinks of hummus get some hummus for you give that a try what's that face i am definitely going to be doing a lot more with these lupini flakes as well as the lupini flour from av8 foods in terms of the flakes i think something like granola would be pretty doable probably even an oatmeal cookie who knows maybe you could cook this up sort of to be like oatmeal i'm not sure but i'm gonna try as for the flour i have used it already to make some chocolate chip cookies and some peanut butter cookies that were just stellar and all i used was the lupini flower now usually with the lupini flower i find i can only do about 25 percent of that as lupini or lupin flower and then it just starts getting that bitter earthy sort of taste to it not so with this i used 100 lupini the cookies were great so in the weeks ahead look for more recipes with me using the sloopini flour and lupini flakes

what my spell alright that's good now the other pan you're doing good are you peeking no that's good I'm hearing a pop the side with the holes in it other side there you go and now you're gonna generously put that all over I would say probably about a tablespoon this back up a little bit towards the corner this Italian seasoning everywhere um going generous be very generous all right other panned more Italian seasoning let's keep going oh yeah try to keep it in the bin I'm not trying to direct your arm all right so this is empty and going into the trash right next is some salts right

mmm oh that smells really good how's the back of my neck smell mmm I love the feeling of raw oiled up vegetables dripping between my fingers all right now we're gonna lay them flat there we go you're I'm just kind of pushing them around a little bit I like to play with my food all right there we go patented giving a little bit of love you gotta you gotta give your food love oh I don't know why I've been I'm very terrified to put these in the oven all right okay go ahead we're gonna open the oven that's the first step okay now we're gonna go sneak around the side of the oven to grab the pan oh there's the pan there's the pan there's one side of the pan and there's the other side of the pan okay not back not slowly this is dangerous no it's not I'm just part of food in the oven okay time out time out China let's just pretend that didn't happen let's keep going quick I get my hands back for this one because that's not gonna work it's now time to make the sauce first I need to put some oil in the pan which is not very strategic olders knife right there um reach straight forward hands straight okay so we're gonna drizzle that in the pan okay now we're gonna set back down turn the fill top on we're gonna reach forward nope not not in the pan and up a little bit and touch that and we're going to press it in and turn it and put it on a medium heat perfect we're open it up now we're going to put our beefin we're gonna smack it make sure it's good quality like to play with my food breaking it apart oh right so now that that's good and browned off I'm going to add some onion and then I'm going to brush it into the pan both of these meals that anybody making are very reasonably priced and they also have a pretty good nutrition content we don't need a whole lot of real red meat but every once in a while it's totally great to just indulge in some red meat and reach for red peppers oh that is plenty now we're gonna grab the Italian seasoning I don't know why I keep saying we I'm doing this all by myself and I'm just a little bit a little bit more there we go perfect these are canned diced tomatoes and mix that all together for the chicken we did this part ahead of time because you want to have it marinating for at least 30 minutes so now we're gonna coat the entire pan in olive oil get it nice and oiled up guys um timeout for a second don't don't try this at home because this is kind of this is kind of dangerous babe we're gonna grab this tongs and we're gonna put some chicken in the pan okay well I guess if we can just touch the chicken but nice and marinated and we're gonna put that right in the pan play it nice and how are we gonna just drop it alright so now we're gonna boil the pasta there we go alright we're gonna make sure the best of all nice and mixed together alright now that the kale is all nice and mixed through the pasta we are going to add some salt and some other seasonings salt straight ahead babe reach for my tiny t-rex arms all right there we go I can reach that all right oh that's good maybe you just kind of reach for there we go might be easier if I turn the spoon the other way but we'll see nice and stir it up I'm going to put some parmesan in now just generously sprinkle this all over it in little by little I'm going to stir it in after I put even more in all right so that's the mill as you can see it's a lot of food for the month you just did it good night so this is the money you get yeah you want to explain what we got going on all right so these are the blistered tomatoes and a photo like I'll write out how to make this in the description but these are the blistered tomatoes that kind of go with the parmesan garlic kale pasta with the chicken these are this is the vegetable medley with the squash and everything in it and then this is the garlic kale Parmesan pasta this is the chicken that goes with the pasta and then this is actually a green superfood spaghetti so it's got like kale got spirulina

welcome back to\u00a0\nanother keto dinner ideas video this\u00a0\u00a0 week it is all about keto pork chop\u00a0\nrecipes so these are all great if you\u00a0\u00a0 have bone-in chops boneless chops or even if\u00a0\nyou just want to get a big pork loin while they're on sale and slice them yourself like i do\u00a0\nso uh if you're not already subscribed go\u00a0\u00a0 ahead and hit that subscribe button now\u00a0\njoin the crew let's get into the video first up this week we have these easy creamy\u00a0\ngarlic parmesan keto pork chops from kasey trenum\u00a0\u00a0 so to start with in a large skillet over medium\u00a0\nhigh heat i'm adding a couple tablespoons of\u00a0\u00a0 extra virgin olive oil once it's nice and\u00a0\nhot i'm adding half of a sliced medium onion and i'm just sauteing that for a couple minutes\u00a0\njust to let it go ahead and start softening a\u00a0\u00a0 little scooting all of my onions to one side\u00a0\ni'm adding in four boneless pork chops and\u00a0\u00a0 these are ones that i bought already cut so\u00a0\nthey're a little bit thinner than the ones\u00a0\u00a0 i usually cut myself we're just gonna sear\u00a0\nthese for about three minutes on each side\u00a0\u00a0   scooting my onions out of the way a little i did\u00a0\nsalt and pepper these on each side as well now\u00a0\u00a0 flipping those over we're gonna do the same thing\u00a0\non the other side for about three minutes and when\u00a0\u00a0 those were about halfway done on the other side i\u00a0\nturned my heat down to medium and added a heaping\u00a0\u00a0 teaspoon of minced garlic i'm just using my\u00a0\nspoon to kind of toss that around and then\u00a0\u00a0 i'm also going to kind of scoop it up after i cook\u00a0\nit like about 30 seconds scoop it up put it on top\u00a0\u00a0 of my pork chops because i do not want my garlic\u00a0\nto burn and let this finish browning now removing\u00a0\u00a0 my pork chops to a separate plate i'm just\u00a0\nsticking this to the side and adding in one cup of\u00a0\u00a0 heavy whipping cream and whisking that and going\u00a0\nahead and scraping up all of the little brown bits\u00a0\u00a0 off the bottom of the skillet before adding in\u00a0\none ounce of cream cheese i just broke this apart\u00a0\u00a0 as well as a third of a cup chicken broth i\u00a0\nuse reduced sodium and a third of a cup grated\u00a0\u00a0 parmesan cheese then i'm just going to whisk\u00a0\nthis all together until it is nice and melted\u00a0\u00a0 and smoothly combined also adding a fourth of\u00a0\na teaspoon sea salt and a half of a teaspoon\u00a0\u00a0 ground black pepper along with one tablespoon\u00a0\nof italian seasoning and whisking that all in\u00a0\u00a0 before adding a half a cup extra sharp shredded\u00a0\ncheddar cheese and mixing this in until it's\u00a0\u00a0 melted and i did go ahead and cut my heat down to\u00a0\nlow and i'm adding my pork chops back to the pan\u00a0\u00a0 along with their juices and i'm just gonna flip\u00a0\nthese over and make sure they're nice and fully\u00a0\u00a0 coated in our sauce and i did go ahead and let\u00a0\nthese simmer for probably about 10 more minutes\u00a0\u00a0 on low just to make sure my pork chops were cooked\u00a0\nto temperature in the middle and as you can see\u00a0\u00a0 this makes a whole lot of extra sauce this recipe\u00a0\nthe original one i have linked down below was for\u00a0\u00a0 six servings i went ahead and just did four pork\u00a0\nchops when i was cooking mine but you might want\u00a0\u00a0 to do a couple more and here is plated up over\u00a0\nsome steamed zoodles just zucchini spirals that i\u00a0\u00a0 did in the microwave and i topped it with a little\u00a0\nbit of shaved parmesan cheese that i had kicking\u00a0\u00a0 around in the fridge this was excellent i will\u00a0\nsay as far as using the italian blend seasoning\u00a0\u00a0 it is a little heavy on rosemary and i'm not a big\u00a0\nrosemary fan so probably the next time i make it\u00a0\u00a0 i'll make my own italian seasoning blend leaving\u00a0\nout the rosemary but if you're a rosemary fan then\u00a0\u00a0 you will like that and i still enjoyed it but just\u00a0\nnot as much as if i would have made my own blend\u00a0\u00a0 next up we made these awesome keto pork chops with\u00a0\nthe blue cheese sauce this is from the diet doctor\u00a0\u00a0 so in a small saucepan over medium heat I'm taking\u00a0\nfive ounces of blue cheese what i have here is\u00a0\u00a0 already pre-crumbled but you could use a big block\u00a0\nand crumble it yourself and i am whisking this\u00a0\u00a0 over medium heat pretty constantly to make sure\u00a0\nthat it melts consistently but doesn't burn and\u00a0\u00a0 after that is nice and smoothly melted i'm just\u00a0\ngoing to add 3 4 of a cup heavy whipping cream to\u00a0\u00a0 it whisk that in bring up the temperature just\u00a0\na little let this come up to a bubbling simmer\u00a0\u00a0 and then i'm going to cut the heat down to low and\u00a0\nwhisk this and just let it cook for a few minutes\u00a0\u00a0 and then just kind of simmer on low while i get\u00a0\nstarted on our pork chops and so for those in\u00a0\u00a0 a large skillet over medium-high heat i have one\u00a0\ntablespoon of butter and i'm adding my pork chops\u00a0\u00a0 to the pan again it's just four boneless pork\u00a0\nchops i did salt and pepper these on each side\u00a0\u00a0 and i'm going to brown these for about three\u00a0\nminutes on each side flipping them over and again\u00a0\u00a0 just browning them for a few minutes on the other\u00a0\nside and i do have my oven preheated to 350 i'm\u00a0\u00a0 going to remove these to a glass casserole dish\u00a0\nand just pop them in the oven for about another\u00a0\u00a0 10 minutes to come all the way to temperature\u00a0\ninternally while i go ahead and cook our green\u00a0\u00a0 beans so emptying those pan juices from our pork\u00a0\nchops into our blue cheese just gonna whisk that\u00a0\u00a0 in there give it a little extra flavor and then\u00a0\njust let that continue sitting back to our skillet\u00a0\u00a0 over medium-high heat i added another tablespoon\u00a0\nof butter once that was melted nice and foamy\u00a0\u00a0 i'm adding seven ounces of long stem green beans\u00a0\nyou can use fresh ones those will probably taste\u00a0\u00a0 better but i honestly love buying the large bags\u00a0\nof long stem green beans from costco and i just\u00a0\u00a0 thaw them out a little bit on the counter before\u00a0\ni cook them and they taste almost just as good as\u00a0\u00a0 fresh i'm just tossing these around with my tongs\u00a0\na little we're gonna cook these until they're nice\u00a0\u00a0 and brown i'm gonna sprinkle them with a generous\u00a0\namount of sea salt as well as some freshly ground\u00a0\u00a0 black pepper and again just tossing those and\u00a0\ncooking them in the butter until they are nice\u00a0\u00a0 and charred and here it is plated up we just have\u00a0\na side of the green beans with our pork chop and\u00a0\u00a0 our blue cheese sauce drizzled over the top i did put a\u00a0\n pinch of parsley on this for just photo's sake\u00a0\u00a0 what i will say about this recipe is if you are\u00a0\nnot a blue cheese fan you will absolutely hate\u00a0\u00a0 this because it's just straight blue cheese\u00a0\nand cream and that is a very pungent distinct\u00a0\u00a0 flavor my husband and i loved it but again it's\u00a0\na very unique flavor so if you're not a fan of\u00a0\u00a0 blue cheese i'm sure you can make this recipe\u00a0\nwith even like a feta cheese or just a straight\u00a0\u00a0 melted parmesan sauce and it would be excellent\u00a0\nthat way as well next up we're making these\u00a0\u00a0 super easy instant pot sour cream pork chops this\u00a0\noriginal recipe is from wholesome recipe box so\u00a0\u00a0 i'll link that down below you could also make this\u00a0\non your stovetop pretty easily so to start with in\u00a0\u00a0 our instant pot on the saute function i'm adding\u00a0\na tablespoon of butter and then i'm adding one\u00a0\u00a0 small to medium onion that's just sliced up into\u00a0\nwedges stirring this around i'm just gonna cook it\u00a0\u00a0 about a minute just to let it go ahead and start\u00a0\nthe softening process then i'm scooting my onions\u00a0\u00a0 to one side and adding in four boneless pork chops\u00a0\nnow these are actually pork chops that i've sliced\u00a0\u00a0 from a big pork loin myself i highly recommend\u00a0\nyou do that most of the grocery stores around me\u00a0\u00a0 constantly putting their pork loins on sale and so\u00a0\nmuch cheaper than getting them already sliced up\u00a0\u00a0 scooting those onions over on top of the other ones\u00a0\nto squeeze in our last two pork chops and we're\u00a0\u00a0 just going to cook these a couple minutes on each\u00a0\nside just to brown them a little seasoning them\u00a0\u00a0 with some sea salt as well as some freshly ground\u00a0\nblack pepper and we're just gonna flip them over\u00a0\u00a0 you can see it was stuck a little there in that\u00a0\ninstant pot i'm gonna add a little bit more sea\u00a0\u00a0 salt and ground black pepper on this side as well\u00a0\nand then flipping them back to the original side\u00a0\u00a0 we started on i'm going to add one cup of beef\u00a0\nbroth to our pot along with one teaspoon of\u00a0\u00a0 worcestershire sauce and just using a spoon to\u00a0\nkind of mix that around and scraping the bottom\u00a0\u00a0 of the instant pot while we do that just to make\u00a0\nsure we get up any kind of browned bits off the\u00a0\u00a0 bottom once i have those all situated i'm going\u00a0\nto pop my lid on we're going to cook this on high\u00a0\u00a0 pressure for eight minutes now after that cooks\u00a0\ni let it naturally release for five minutes and\u00a0\u00a0 then i'm just throwing a dish towel over it to\u00a0\nkind of block the steam from hitting the camera\u00a0\u00a0 and using my slotted spoon to slide that vent so\u00a0\nthat we can let out the rest of the steam without\u00a0\u00a0 burning ourself and once we have that out and it's\u00a0\nsafely done we're going to open it up this is what\u00a0\u00a0 it looks like even cooking just eight minutes on\u00a0\nhigh pressure they're all nice and tender using a\u00a0\u00a0 slotted spoon to pull those out into a separate\u00a0\ndish for a moment turning your instant pot back\u00a0\u00a0 onto the saute function and sprinkling a fourth\u00a0\nof a teaspoon xanthan gum to help thicken this up\u00a0\u00a0 just going to whisk that in and let it simmer\u00a0\nfor a few more minutes after it does i turned\u00a0\u00a0 the heat off on the instant pot let it cool for\u00a0\na few seconds and then i'm adding in a third of\u00a0\u00a0 a cup sour cream and whisking that in until it\u00a0\nis nice and smooth and after i did that it still\u00a0\u00a0 wasn't as thick as i would like so i added another\u00a0\nfourth of a teaspoon xanthan gum and whisk that in\u00a0\u00a0 as well and then i just added my chops back to\u00a0\nthe pot and stirred them around make sure they\u00a0\u00a0 were nice and fully coated in the meantime i went\u00a0\nahead and popped a little steam bag of cauliflower\u00a0\u00a0 rice into the microwave seasoned it with some\u00a0\nsauce pepper and butter and here it is plated up\u00a0\u00a0 i just served the pork chop with the sauce right\u00a0\nover that cauliflower rice this was excellent this\u00a0\u00a0 was probably this might have been my favorite of\u00a0\nthe week i don't know it's a hard call because i\u00a0\u00a0 love pork chops so much by the way if you're not\u00a0\na fan of pork chops you could definitely make any\u00a0\u00a0 of these keto pork chop recipes with chicken or\u00a0\nbeef and i'm sure they would be just as good last\u00a0\u00a0 up this week we have a super simple recipe from\u00a0\nketo for carbaholics it's a buttered pork chop\u00a0\u00a0 i'm opting to cook mine in the crock pot but her\u00a0\noriginal recipe linked down below does have oven\u00a0\u00a0 recipe directions so to start with my crock pot\u00a0\nyou see i just sprayed it down putting in four\u00a0\u00a0 boneless pork loin chops that are salt\u00a0\nand peppered on each side and then i'm\u00a0\u00a0 evenly sprinkling two teaspoons of garlic powder\u00a0\nover each of them so a half a teaspoon of garlic\u00a0\u00a0 powder on each along with two teaspoons of chives\u00a0\nover each and i just always use the uh freeze\u00a0\u00a0 freeze-dried chives you just get in the spice\u00a0\nsection along with one teaspoon of dried parsley and half a teaspoon of sage and then i'm just drizzling them with a\u00a0\ncouple teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil\u00a0\u00a0 putting a tablespoon of butter on each one\u00a0\nand pouring in half of a cup of chicken broth\u00a0\u00a0 into the bottom of our crock pot then i'm putting\u00a0\nthe lid on and because i am impatient i'm cooking\u00a0\u00a0 mine on high for four hours you could do low\u00a0\nfor eight hours or a combination of the two this\u00a0\u00a0 is what they look like after they are done and i\u00a0\ndid pop some broccoli into the microwave to steam\u00a0\u00a0 and plated it up with that here you go these are\u00a0\nalso tender of course the longer you cook them\u00a0\u00a0 in the crock pot the more tender they would be\u00a0\nthese were excellent probably my second favorite\u00a0\u00a0 pork chop recipe of the week so there you are\u00a0\nthat's this week's keto dinner ideas video i hope\u00a0\u00a0 you enjoyed it all about the keto pork chops and\u00a0\nagain just an awesome tip to buy

more\u00a0\npork chops to pretty easily it made more sauce\u00a0\u00a0 than i needed for the amount of pork chops that i\u00a0\ncooked so next time i make any of them i probably\u00a0\u00a0 will add two more pork chops to each but this is\u00a0\nhow i had mine packaged in portion sizes of four\u00a0\u00a0 so that's what i went with hope you enjoyed this\u00a0\nweek's video if you did please give

Hello everyone, Cacao!\u2234\u2235\u309e(\u00b4\u03c9`*)\u266a This time, the sausage is made with cacao seasoning, Cacao Jang. This long sheep intestine is used to stuff the meat. Wash it lightly and remove the salt for 30 minutes. Make the meat broth. We'll talk about this Cacao Jang at the end. Quickly mix without kneading too much and you're done. Let the casing hang out until the end. It was hard work because it required a lot of strength. When air bubbles form, prick them with a waiting needle to remove the air.

Cacao Jang has a salty taste like soy sauce and goes well with vegetables. I love that it goes well with light foods. Delicious! Just the right amount of salt, chewy and delicious. Cacao Jang taste similar to light soy sauce, but with the flavor of cocoa.\nIt was great mixed with mustard. Cacao in progress. Please be quiet. Happy to eat rice with just this mustard. Now, all the happiness in the world is gathered in my mouth. It was a reminder that the sausage changed color because it took so long to photograph. May the force of cocoa be with you. This is the \"Cacao Jang\" used in this project.\nI bought it myself and reviewed it on my own. There are two types: grain type and paste type. In this case, I used it to add a salty taste instead of salt. It looks a little different with the grains, but the ingredients are the same and the taste is the same.

Thank you for watching.", "LRSy3x33TtQ": "hi welcome back to my channel I'm Myra from low carb love and today we're gonna be making some delicious crispy airfryer lemon pepper occasion wings ok so let's go over our ingredients we're gonna be needing of course your wings so these are just regular frozen wings there's like nothing on them okay then we have some avocado oil we have garlic powder Cajun seasoning regular salt lemon pepper seasoning we have some butter and then we will need our airfryer so if you don't have an airfryer you can definitely use an oven or you can still cook these stove tops so let's get started okay so we're gonna end up seasoning these wings twice right now we're just gonna do the initial you know like the main seasoning and once they're done we will do this little butter sauce that I'll show you how how I make it so anyway that was avocado oil so we added roughly about two tablespoons now we're gonna do a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder okay so we're just going to sprinkle then we're going to do 1 teaspoon of the Cajun seasoning and then we're going to do 1 teaspoon of the lemon pepper okay okay so that was one teaspoon of lemon pepper as for the salt it's really if you love everything like really salted then you want to add either like a quarter of a teaspoon an eighth of a teaspoon or just a pinch so for me I feel like everything's already pretty salt you know it's it's gonna have enough salt so I just did two pinches and now we're gonna mix everything up and I'll show you the next step okay so we have some tongs that we're just going to I mean you can totally do this with your hand but just so I don't look so Savage II here I'm gonna try and you know get them all well coated way too tall I might just have to go on like my hands okay so I'm mixing them up and I'm seeing that they need a little bit of seasoning here so I don't know if it's because my wings are just a little bigger so what we're gonna do is just add double the the spices so there's another half a teaspoon of garlic powder and then we're just going to do another teaspoon of the Cajun seasoning and another teaspoon of the lemon pepper which is pretty much what we have it neither okay so now we're going to mix them up and I'm just gonna I have to do it I just have to do the hand it's the only way to really get them all coated and you know make sure that it's all distributed evenly so once these are all nice and coated then we're gonna get them into our air fryer okay so this is what our wings should look like once they're nice and coated and we have about 10 wings in here so now working out I'm going to position them here into our air fryer so we're going to play Tetris and put them all in one batch I just put them on like straight directly on to that you know onto the lid Grill in here whatever you call it but if you want to put like parchment paper or something I'm sure there would be just fine sure that's how that's all Cosworth's obviously JK okay so I was able to fit all ten wings in we're gonna put them into our air fryer 400 degrees for we're gonna start it off at 15 minutes and I will show you what they look like in 15 okay so while our wings are cooking we're gonna make some of Hannah's cilantro sauce and we'll link it in the description below so you can go check it out it's in her highlights but I'm gonna show you how we make it so it'll be a cup of mayo which is about there and so then we're gonna do three tablespoons of mustard so I'm just using regular yellow mustard okay so we have our cup of mayo and now we're gonna do our three tablespoons of mustard and again I'm just using a regular yellow mustard we're going to do our dry really quickly which this is some cumin we're just going to do a half a teaspoon of cumin right it gets a little cumin from the Mexican section but you can find it everywhere and let's do salt so half a teaspoon of salt or to taste and so for the garlic I'm gonna use minced garlic this is half a teaspoon per garlic clove so the recipe calls for three garlic cloves so we're gonna do one and a half teaspoons right and you're literally gonna use a whole bunch so like the bunch of cilantro okay I know okay and last are our little jalapeno so you can use three four I'm gonna use five big help hands because I do want it spicy this is my second time making it and the first time I felt like it wasn't spicy enough so we're gonna use five with all the scenes okay so we're gonna get our lid right this is pretty jammed so let's see if this little blender because I have a baby blender I want to get a big blender but we're gonna see if this can handle it and we have our little tool here to push everything so okay so look at this baby looks absolutely delicious I already tried a and you know what the spice is not overwhelming like I like spicy but I don't like my mouth to be on fire and this is actually perfect so now let's go ahead and put this to the side I'm gonna show you how we make our little butter sauce okay so our two tablespoons of butter melted here we have see that's you know I usually eyeball everything but I'm trying to get an exact measurement for you so this is definitely like a half teaspoon so this is a garlic powder we're going to add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder so 1/2 a teaspoon of occasion and I'm gonna link all of the measurements below so how so that you guys have the exact recipe and this is the lemon pepper okay so now let's get this mixed up and I'm going to show you how wait awesome okay so I wanted these extra crispy so these have been in here for 25 to 30 minutes and now we're gonna take them out and put them in our sauce okay so now that they're all in here let's go ahead and awesome just let me get them all coated in our little butter sauce they're so calm I'll show you once they're all coated and then we're just gonna serve them with our little cilantro sauce that we just made okay so as you can see the wings have absorbed all the all our sauce a little butter sauce so now we're gonna serve are we I'm telling you because we're all done with the recipe now they turned out so beautiful we have our lemon pepper wings with our cilantro sauce and then we have a little side of celery so our favorite part taste test let's do this [Music] oh I see mm-hmm probably wins not because it needs to be spicier it's perfect we ended up using five jalapenos but we're top there's this lemon pepper sauce that little butter sauce sake and it's perfection so thank you so much for joining me on today's video I hope you liked the recipe it's super simple and totally worth making make sure that you tag me on Instagram so that I can share your recreations with everyone on my stories and until next time we love

eight carbs 25 grams - 18 grams whatever that equals it - guys I'm gonna do like 4 cups worth of pasta I'm gonna add this is 2 cups yeah I probably do 4 cups I did about 4 and a half cups it really doesn't matter just as long as it's covering it cuz we're gonna drain it anyway all right let's put it in a locked position all right now what's unique about this pressure cooker guys it releases the steam on its own which is completely pimp like I remember the company gave this to me by thinking year or two ago and you know it's been sitting on top of my cabinets and today I just felt like using it because it really is a unique machine these are the type of machines that you find in the back of the Chinese restaurants where they make their rice it's a machine like this y'all link will be in the description if you're interested anyway anyway let's go through my menu oh yeah I want to do multi cook yeah I'm a cook and by the way don't I know it says 15 minutes and that might be unusual to most of you but it's really not 15 minutes it's is counting the time it takes to come to pressure and the time to release the pressure so it probably equal out to about eight nine minutes about no seven eight minutes so yes which I know about that oh my gosh just take a look yep we're down so I'm gonna um drain this and just set it aside cuz I'm gonna make my homemade alfredo sauce I'll show you guys how easy it isn't simple it is do not use that jar crap because it's just so easy okay we want to turn it to the browning function at this point guys [Music] I'll bump it up to twenty minutes I don't think I need that long when we hit cook all right so I'm just gonna add a stick a tablespoon of butter guys settle for some butter in there I got some heavy whipping cream guys and just to show you the carbs look at that one gram then I put in one cup for us because I really don't have that much fettuccine 4 cups of 13 is not alive pretty much enough for me like a meal and a half which is fine so I just want for tonight's dinner what I may need to add more usually I add 2 cups so we'll see yeah we can definitely do to go okay so two cups because I want mine kind of swimming in Alfredo so two cups would be good yeah it should be good now all you need now is like a good Italian seasoning or like some garlic pink salt black pepper type deal maybe some onion and some onion powder but I'm gonna go with my flavor God today Italian zest and then the great thing about seasoning your sauce is you know you can taste it as you go all right just start mixing also gonna add some pink salt and black pepper I'm by the way I did add some garlic to it I know I didn't show you but garlic is definitely key we're gonna add some parmesan a little later all right guys I'm gonna start putting in my fettuccine slowly just like giving it a mix like that talk together and have too much cuz we're almost yes all of it when I had my meat and all that stuff should be good let that rock for a little bit go ahead oops sorry let's go ahead and had some parsley flakes all right guys I'm gonna add my meat [Music] now obviously you could you could have chicken but that's it it's not some

your life is trying to find nutritious alternatives for between meals snacking today we're again Vega protein crisps right off the bat I might be pronouncing bigger wrong can let me know that in the comments I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing crisps correctly though even though like difficulty saying it so at least fit the bill let's go straight to the nutrition facts this Veiga crisps serving size is 200 calories that's one bag that's a very big snack something you want to keep in mind and with those 200 calories you're getting 8 grams of fat about 19 grams of carbohydrates and 15 grams of protein if you're looking for a high protein chips snack this looks like it fits the bill how does that compare to say a regular bag of potato chips I like to use the Lay's potato chips because it's basically a generic stand-in for grabbing a salty crunchy snack now you'll note that a serving size of Lay's is 160 calories serving sizes completely arbitrary you can eat as many chips as you like so let's gross that 160 calories up to meet the 200 calories that is the Vegas we do apples and apples comparison in terms of caloric content so an equivalent 200 calories serving of Lay's potato chips would have 12 1/2 grams of fat just under 19 grams of carbs basically the same basically the same sugar and fiber two and a half grams of protein basically you're swapping protein for fat when you go from the ladies regular potato chips to these mega crisps they are swapping in a lot more protein in terms of grams than you are taking out in fact but that's because fat has nine calories per gram whereas protein is four calories per gram basically you're removing 40 calories in fat and not even 50 calories of protein carbohydrates are essentially the same the rest is just rounding errors so if that's kind of trade off you're looking for in your snacking again this is not exactly Paoli or keto this is a decent amount of carbs you could basically the same carbs in both but you're trading off the fat and you're getting a bunch of protein now back to that salt that's something I'd like to highlight even grossing up the Lay's potato chips these are salty potato chips right this is the regular ones it's not a low-sodium version two hundred and twelve point five milligrams of sodium in the Lay's 430 grams of sodium in the Vega chips now I come across this a lot with these kind of protein chips I think they're trying to cover up the protein taste essentially and what you're losing by taking out the fat by just throwing a salt bomb on these things it's not something you want to do a lot most studies coming out lately or indicating that salt is probably not that big a deal for people who don't have a particular problem like hypertension but still that's not a huge chunk of salt so this is not something you necessarily want to make a daily habit with a Lay's worth of Vega so those are the facts the objective data what about the subjective part of this taste and texture let's take a look back I'll tell you what these have a really odd look to them they are vaguely structured like corn chips and yet not they're just almost haphazardly put together I honestly tell you how you'll find that just a little oddly unappetizing but otherwise leaving that aside they have a nice crisp to him a nice crunch calling these crisps was a good idea because they're not really like anything else so just call them crisps that's generic enough that it works but you can tell this bag by the way I'll show you the quantity that's a fair amount we'll only had a few what about taste and basically mouthfeel I actually like these I think the crunch is really good the flavors relatively subtle like a garlic and herb because that's what I felt like if it sounded like a good fit for these kind of crisps I haven't tried anything else now look overall these are good also and I mentioned before in some other videos it's a big bag it's got a lot of crunch there's a lot in this thing so you'll get a good deal pleasure just eating pleasure I'm sitting down in your back of course this is highly subjective and I'll throw some Amazon review comments after the disclaimers at the end of this video can take a look at those there's always differences of opinion on this but these these I think work for me I like these and I will throw an affiliate link down in the description for them if you'd like to buy these I'd buy them by the box from Amazon I find that's the cheapest way to get them before you go check out that subscriber button in the corner there hit the alert bells you get future videos we do nutrition motivation exercise to work share I'll share my website John health and fitness calm and leave a comment before you go again how do you pronounce them is it big or a big I think it's could be either one I don't know anyway thanks for joining me appreciate spending some time check these out and hope to see you again [Music] actually it was unreviewed oka folly you from K Oh gross finally from g3 the mouthfeel is like cardboard and the taste while not repulsive is not good enough to compensate for the texture and there's a marketing line for you mega protein crisps the flavor is not repulsive as always opinions differ when it comes to taste and texture but I do like them [Music]", "UghYCHGbqzs": "[Music]", "CIFXhnSXPYw": "garlic taste test we are comparing freshly peeled and chopped garlic with pre peeled garlic garlic powder garlic paste from a tube jarred garlic paste from an indian grocery and jarred and minced garlic to my shock the freshly peeled and chopped did not quite come out decisively on top for the test I made garlic bread to make two portions of each sample I mixed 20 grams of softened butter with a tiny pinch of salt and 10 grams of garlic except for the garlic powder because it's dehydrated it's way lighter so I just kind of eyeballed it 6 samples all mapped out on parchment there is my key so I won't forget which is which I smeared the garlic butters onto my bread for the record this is proportionately more garlic than you probably want in your garlic bread I just wanted to make sure the garlic flavor would be loud and clear for the purposes of comparison gaaah running out of room I baked it for 15 minutes chopped it up and served it to my tasters this is novelist and noted garlic lover Lauren Morel Miley catchphrases there's no such thing as too much garlic she and I are married this is chemistry professor garland Crawford he and I worked together at Mercer University he's really into food science I gave them water and apple slices to use as palate cleansers and here we go with sample number 1 the freshly peeled and chopped garlic I feel like that's the fresh garlic because I'm very spicy got a lot of punch to it I like that sample too is pre peeled garlic which I actually froze before chopping up because I don't think there's any point in buying a big container of pre peeled garlic unless you can freeze most of it it was actually easier to chop up when it was frozen solid a little milder almost a little sweeter yeah it's still got the local spiciness sharp but not that one was like so to understand what's going on here let's take a break and learn about garlic chemistry the stuff that makes garlic taste hot is a molecule called allicin it's created inside the garlic when the garlic is damaged ie when you cut it up crush it or chew it garlic treats it as a defense mechanism so you've got the molecule that generates that garlic flavor is separated from the enzyme that utilizes that molecule so as you take the garlic and break it down more finely you cut it the more the interaction happens but you bring that alamin molecule in contact with the a Linnaeus enzyme that gives us that Allisyn molecule that's what we think that was our distinctly garlic flavor and there's a similar process that happens in for example the Browning of apples that when you cut those open you're putting together the substrate and the enzyme because you broke in cell walls or they're normally separated coming back to this pre peeled garlic it tasted a little bit less hot perhaps because it had been refrigerated and indeed frozen a little bit less Allison had been made inside of it since it's an enzymatic reaction it's one of the things you can do to slow that reaction down is to put in the fridge in the freezer it helps to hold on just some of those things all right sample number three is the garlic bread made with garlic powder I think that one probably is garlic powder oh yeah I got it mmm yeah I'm a big fan of garlic powder but it's just an entirely different thing from fresh garlic it's like dried mushrooms versus fresh mushrooms two really great things but not really interchangeable sample number four is the garlic paste from a tube very convenient shelf-stable you don't have to refrigerate it until you open it there's a distinct flavor mmm it's almost cheese like like really mild on the garlic's and doesn't have any punch to it right like these yeah you're right almost very green almost money so what's going on here why no hot and spicy Alison this paste as far as I know had not been refrigerated or frozen before I used it well as soon as you create the Alison by damaging the garlic it starts to break down into other compounds that don't taste as pungent in 2008 Japanese researchers who were studying the many health benefits of Alison found that the Alison in crushed garlic has a chemical half-life of just 11 days at least 11 days when stored in a water-based solution at room temperature in oil the half-life was only three hours if you cook it of course you're talking about minutes or even seconds to break down the Alison that's why cooking mellows out garlic but coming back to this paste it was probably chock-full of Alison when it was first manufactured but by the time it got to my kitchen all of that Alison had broken down it has no pungency whatsoever sample 5 is the bottled garlic paste that I got from the Indian grocery here in Macon garlic paste is very important in the South Asian food though I think it's often made fresh in the home no sour little acidic this particular garlic paste has vinegar and citric acid in it probably to function as preservatives to slow down those enzymatic processes we talked about : being able to slow it down pass it also does some of the same thing number 6 the sixth and final sample is the jarred minced garlic garlic wise is very subtle no no the pungent see none of the the short taste it almost tastes a little synthetic or something it was made to taste like garlic right now it tastes like you'd get it like a right I'm gonna have to believe that so we don't get sued at a fast casual Italian eatery yeah I'm sorry the Allison and this has just totally broken down even if you use double or triple the amount to compensate you would never get any of that hot pungent flavor that you get from fresh garlic the flavor that I'm looking for most of the time and yeah it kind of tasted artificial too and this is this one is well garlic water phosphoric acid and phosphoric acid as a preservative it helps to stabilize experiment over here are our conclusions if the question is can you tell the difference between fresh garlic and the jarred mints because that's what everyone always asks right yes jarred garlic is not for me no judgment if it gives you the flavor that you're looking for garlic powder and surprisingly this garlic paste both offer interesting flavors that could be used for all kinds of things in the kitchen but probably not for replacing fresh chopped garlic actually come to think about it in a long cooked dish where most of the Allisyn would break down anyway maybe this paste actually could be a good substitute you know in a sauce or a braise something that cooks for a long time fresh chopped is of course great but surprisingly so is pre peeled from the refrigerator in fact before I told them which sample was which Lauren and garland both said the pre peeled garlic bread was their favorite it seemed to offer a nice balance between the hot Allisyn flavor and all of the other flavor compounds inside fresh garlic partly that might be the cold slowing down the Allis and creating reaction when you chop it up but it might also be that some of the garlic's potential Allison was created in the peeling factory surely the process that results in this garlic being peeled is traumatic to a few cell walls and then that Allison has simply broken down by the time it gets to your kitchen and you cook with it but yeah pre-peeled is good and you can refrigerate it or freeze it but if you're after that super hot punch go with the real deal for pasta with garlic and olive oil or butter I'm still going old-school grandma Ragusa I hope you are appeased", "s1AGZVxOK_k": "Hello everyone, I am Xiao Gaojie. Let's make garlic pasta with shrimps today. This is the pasta we made with Durum flour. You can also buy this ready-made at the supermarket. Shrimp washed and dried Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to marinate shrimps Prepare some side vegetables now chili pepper, dried chili is OK too smash the garlic first, the skin will peel off quickly. Roughly chop onions Cut some parsley add oil to the pan Put in garlic Slowly saut\u00e9 the garlic with low heat When garlic starts to change color, put the shrimps Take the shrimps out whey they become opaque and turn to white color, If the shrimps are left in the pot, it is easy to get overcooked. And shrimps taste better with garlic on the surface At this time, the garlic is just browned Put onions and red peppers in the pan Slightly stir-fry, after the onion becomes transparent Put in half-half cream This is a cream with 10% fat content. Add some Parmesan cheese Slowly heat it up This is a pot of boiling water prepared in advance. Add salt to the pot Put in noodles Take the pasta out, when it is cooked 70-80% doneness. Fresh pasta is cooked very easily. Probably boil for about a minute The cream here is hot, and the cheese is melted. Put in pasta Wrapped in white sauce Cook the pasts with low heat At this time, pasta will absorb the cream sauce at the end, save some sauce in the pot. If it is too dry, add a little pasta water Finally put the shrimps Leave two or three as garnish Chopped parsley You don't need to add salt, there are salt in the pasta. Shrimps are also flavored Parmesan cheese is also salty Taste it first, then decide if you need more salt Put in the bowl Sprinkle a little parsley a little cheese Finally put the shrimps on the top Let\u2019s have a taste. You see the shrimp is very tender The sauce which is full of flavors of garlic and shrimps with a little bit spicy aftertaste at the end is fully wrapped around the fresh pasta which we made by hand It\u2019s so beautiful and delicious.

show you how I take my 90 second bread recipe and I increase it and we're going to make Keto garlic bread. So let's get started. So like I said, I'm taking the, I want to say, the ratios\nof my Keto 90 second bread, and I'm going to turn\nthat into garlic bread. So you could make an individual serving of the 90 second bread and you could put a little garlic powder on it, put a little butter on it,\nthat's after you cook it in the microwave, and\ntoast it on a skillet. But if you want to make enough\nfor your family for dinner, this is the recipe for you. So we're starting out\nwith some almond flour and I like to use egg\nwhites for this recipe because it makes it less egg-y tasting. You can do that with the 90\nsecond bread recipe as well, just use an egg white. This is a cup and half of egg whites. So I just buy the already pasteurized carton of egg whites in the grocery store. This is some melted butter. And we need baking powder. Mix that all up. I'm also going to add\na little bit of salt. And that is all there is\nto the base of this recipe. This is going to make our bread. We're going to bake this\nin a 350 degree oven and it's going to take about 15 minutes. I've got this 13 by 9 sheet pan that I've already sprayed\nwith cooking spray. Okay this is ready for\nour sprayed baking tray, sheet tray, or whatever\nyou want to call it. We're going to make sure\nthis is all an even layer. Okay this is ready for the oven. Okay here's our bread out of the oven. We did 15 minutes at 350 degrees. And now, we're going to cut\nit into 12 equal slices. Or try to. Okay now we're going to pull them out, and they're prefect. Look it, that's going to be\na nice piece of garlic bread. So we're going to pull these out and put 'em on the sheet tray. We're going to put our\ngarlic butter on them, and then we're going to put them under the broiler to crisp up. Okay for our garlic\nbutter, I've got butter, melted butter here. I'm going to put some garlic powder in the garlic butter. I've also got some dried parsley. And now we're going to mix it up. Now it's ready for the\ntops of our garlic bread. This is so garlic-y, so delicious. Okay we're going to broil these for, I don't know, until\nthey're brown and crispy. And after just a few\nminutes under the broiler, they look amazing. And I'm not going to\ntouch or eat one right now because they're super hot. But they've got a nice crispy crust on top and they are going to be\nperfect for any Italian recipe that you've got cooking for dinner. This is the easiest garlic bread. You should definitely make it. If you want the recipe, just\ngo to the description below and the entire recipe is down there. Or, if you want a printable recipe, you can go to the link in the description and it will take you to my website, and you can print the recipe, no problem.

me ridiculous stuff and I put into a video my first request comes from cannibal meal time JP could you please sawed-off Julia's arm and cook it and wrapped bacon well I guess that depends if I have bath salts lying around and I do I was joking that's sick you sick sick person my next request comes from a Jennifer s please please please please please can you recreate Little Caesars crazy bread please please please you really think that mana pleases is going to affect my decision well it did crazy bread I don't really get why they call this stuff crazy bread other than the fact that you're eating from Little Caesars I mean look at their logo the guy looks like an arrogant prick anyway this recipe is super easy because our gonna need is a dough can butter garlic salt Parmesan cheese I think it's crazy how simple this is start by popping this canister open roll it out slice it in about 1-inch strips like so and a bunch of gratuitous camera angles and brush it down generously with some butter and or oil or until it just shimmers so I decided to add cornmeal completely optional your options to be awesome and as you can see I'm just peeling these back onto my baking pan one at a time hey Pete why would you do that when you can just roll it on the baking pan to start with what do you mean you know just grease up your pan and lay your dough on it and cut it on the pan and bake it all right I get it now pre bake the dough at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for five minutes and if the bread happens to catch on fire simply grab a pair of tongs and freak out a little now ml 1/4 stick of butter in a dirty microwave for 30 seconds take out and add one teaspoon of garlic salt this will give us that crazy little caesars culinary KC now take your pre baked bread out spread on our garlic butter and sprinkle on some cheese if you don't have cheese just tilt your head over the dough and scratch your scalp now we're gonna bake this for seven more minutes and one of the tricks that I'm totally being serious - slightly undercooked the dough so once it kind of looks like this you're done no crazy bread wouldn't be anything without crazy sauce it's kind of like marinara but crazy just mix tomato sauce this the blah blah blah blah mix heat pour YUM all right guys thank you so much for joining me on why would you request that I know the junk food Rob Dyke this is a kind of a shout-out to you buddy for helping me out giving me a huge boost in a new year you have an awesome audience that showed me a lot of love Rob Dyke here's your one bite for the hell of it my gum this is this is crazy people crazy delicious so we're starting up the New Year 2015 I want to keep things fresh interesting so what I'm thinking is you guys comment below and write down an ingredient and then I will grab out of a hat five things and I have to make something out of those ingredients I just want to say things to Rob one more time guys you got to try this crazy bread out things Jennifer us for the suggestion and honestly what really drew me to that were the pleases", "B5n9fRTNsRI": "hey guys I'm Indian not told me to say that we are going to be making a really simple quick butter chicken today butter chicken chicken you must tikka masala those are like the two most popular I would say amongst people when ordering out chicken tikka masala the chicken's marinated in a yogurt butter chicken is not merited marinated in yogurt it's just a seasoning so we are doing the butter chicken because it is a lot lower in carbs we have 1 pound of chicken breast right here we had chicken breasts at home so that's what we're going with but you can also do chicken thigh then we're going to do a quarter of an onion 2 cloves of garlic so you can go up or down on the garlic and the onion it's really your call we like to just limit our onion because it's a little higher on the carb side so real quickly I'm just going to touch in the seasoning mixture it's not too complicated I didn't want to make it like an intricate thing where you have to go out and have to get a ton of different ingredients so it's really just five spices there's salt we like to use pink salt ground turmeric ground cinnamon ground ginger and chili powder I'm gonna give you the ratio of each and it'll also be linked in the blog post below of what I like in terms of heat flavor but you can mess around with with these flavors as well when you're making your own butter chicken let's start with the onion [Music] another we have your onion and garlic chopped up and minced we are going to cut our chicken into bite-sized pieces as big or as small as you want now that we have our chicken cubed we are going to give our seasoning mixture a little mixi and top it don't be scared to get in there with your hands and so let me just show you this is this is a really generous coating but that's what you're going for because this is where all the spice is gonna come in on to the butter chicken I'm not adding any this is it right here we can set it aside and just let it sit for a couple minutes so you're gonna add two tablespoons of butter to your pan and then you just want to add in your garlic and your onion as your butter mouth we're gonna cook this down for a couple minutes you'll start to smell the garlic and the onion and everything will become a little translucent and soft that's what we're looking for you can smell the onion the garlic everything looks like it's cooking so we are going to add in our chicken now we want to cook our chicken through this looks like it's like three-quarters of the way cooked we're gonna let it simmer a bit so it doesn't have to cook fully but you want to get most of the cooking done before we add the last two ingredients so ordering Indian food out can be really tough we get a lot of questions but some of the good options if you're going to go out and you want to try to stay as cute or friendly as possible is always a butter chicken because you know there's no like yogurt or anything in it and then paneer is a type of it's like a cottage cheese so that's always doable and then SOG is the spinach so there's spinach with chicken spinach with paneer cheese those are a couple of good options that I usually go the route of but you just never know with the hit it like the sugars they always got sugar or like you know to thicken things up some cornstarch so those are some things to be wary of but if you're gonna go out you know there's ways to make the most of it next we are going to add 1 cup heavy whipping cream let's first actually turn down the heat a little and again everything that I'm doing will be in the blog post linked below oh baby and then one and a half tablespoon tomato paste and you want to mix that around now that we've fully incorporated everything we are going to let it simmer with a lid on top of it we don't have a lid for this exact pan so we're using this it's a pizza pan so whatever works whatever you have at home make it work that's what we do oh yeah now we're gonna let it simmer for five to seven you can check on it the sauce thickens a bit and then if you like it just you know more saucy you can keep it as is because the chicken is fully cooked through at this point but if you like a thicker sauce you can just put a lid on it you can allow it to reduce down a little hmm okay so it's been about seven minutes and the colored you can see how it changed into like more of a brighter orange you can up the tomato paste if you want like a darker deeper color what I think is really vital is taste-testing constantly when you're working with any seasonings and I'm sure you're aware of that but especially Indian food so you know while it was covered I took off the lid at one point and I taste tested it to make sure it was exactly what I wanted it allows you to play around with the ingredients if you're also tasting while you're cooking which is a really fun part so it's it's pretty thick you can see so this is this is great for like topping cauliflower rice using our low-carb nan to dip into it oh my god that would be so good I should have made some but yeah definitely check out our low carbon on or you know just pulse up some cauliflower really quickly microwave in and you'll have a full meal right there so let me try this for you hmm Oh ma'am oh that's so good seasonings perfect chickens really tender because it was like simmering in the sauce so the chicken also has a really intense flavor and that's what you want it's so good guys it's perfect so if you're not familiar or you've never had Indian food the way I describe a curry sauce is like it's really velvety and smooth in your mouth so it like coats the entire thing and just glides down into your belly it's really really flavorful and intense a little spicy it's it's a cuisine on its own so you can't it's really hard for me to compare to something else I'd highly recommend you try it if you've never tried it I think butter chicken is a great place to start most people love butter chicken and if you eat it with cauliflower rice you know the flavors a little more mild so if you're not used to it being so intense that's a good route to go so mmm that's a really really quick easy butter chicken recipe you guys can make any night of the week it took less than 30 minutes for me to make and now I have a whole pot of courage a butter chicken for myself check out the blog post linked below it has the entire [Music] go out and mix up let us know what you think [Music]", "MU5G2_BXkeQ": "[Music] [Music] do [Music] bye", "1p3Z7FUVke8": "hello my friends it's danny and today i'm showing you how to make a clean and delicious spinach frittata with peppers and feta cheese this is a super simple recipe that comes together in no time and it's perfect for breakfast lunch or even as a really light fresh dinner and i really enjoy adding frittatas to my meal prep as well because you can eat them cold out of the fridge or room temperature and i love knowing that i have an option in the fridge that is rich in protein and packed with veggies so to get started i've got my oven preheating at 425 degrees fahrenheit so the first thing i like to do is prep all of my ingredients and for my vegetables i'm starting with five ounces of baby spinach now i always buy the baby spinach pre-washed in a container just like this it just makes it so easy and so convenient and then from here i just give it a rough chop i'm going to end up with about four cups of chopped up baby spinach so you could use the spinach or any other green or any other vegetable you enjoy really just take this recipe and use it as your blueprint using your favorite flavors or whatever you have on hand then i have eight ounces of these little baby bell peppers we love keeping these in the house as a snack and i just slice them into thin rings for the frittata so i need one cup of that and then finally a shallot which is really just a mild onion and i'm just gonna again peel that and slice it into nice thin rings the only other filling that i'm going to use is some feta cheese now whenever you're buying feta try to buy it in block form like i have here because it's always going to be fresher and creamier because they don't need any anti-caking agents or anything when they're packing it and then from here you just crumble it up yourself always a great way to get your hands on the best feta then for the body of the frittata i'm using eight whole eggs i personally recommend buying pastured eggs whenever you can these are not only the most nutritious eggs you can get your hands on but they are also the most delicious and then i'm using eight egg whites now i like to add the egg whites just to keep things a little bit lighter plus it boosts up the protein and the frittata but if you prefer you could do all eggs in which case you would use a dozen eggs if you're doing the egg whites like i am what i love to do is buy them pre-separated just like this and then you can just measure them out so eight egg whites would be equivalent to one cup of egg whites then i'm adding just a couple tablespoons of milk you can use any type of milk you prefer the more fat in the milk the richer the frittata is going to be and then a little bit of salt and a little bit of black pepper gently whisk this all together and we are ready to whip up the frittata so over at the stove i have a 12 inch cast iron skillet heating up over a medium low heat i love using my cast iron skillet for the frittata because it's so durable it's just a great pan to have on hand it will cost you about 25 and it will last you a lifetime if you take good care of it so i am a huge fan of the cast iron skillet as the pan starts to heat up i'm gonna add in a tablespoon of coconut oil let that melt create a nice thin coating at the bottom of the pan and then in go my shallots and my pepper rings i'll give that a pinch of salt and we'll gently toss that around i'm just going to let this go for about five to seven minutes i just like for the veggies to soften up a bit but they still have a little bit of a bite to them so i don't necessarily want them to brown or to get too soft then i'm ready for my spinach so this might look like a lot of baby spinach going into the pan but if you've ever worked with fresh spinach before you know how quickly it wilts down so you're gonna see as the spinach hits the heat of the pan it's gonna wilt down quickly and it's gonna end up looking like about a third of what we actually started with once you have the veggies right where you want them right vibrant in color but nice and tender then i'm going to give my eggs one last whisk and pour it right over the veggie mixture then i'm just going to finish this with the crumbled feta cheese spread it all over the top so that when you are enjoying your frittata you get a little bit with each bite i let this go for about a minute just till the sides set up a little bit and then i'm going to transfer the pan do this very carefully especially if you're working with cast iron because it is heavy into my 425 degree oven and let that cook anywhere between 8 to 12 minutes 10 tends to be the happy medium now if you guys are enjoying my simple delicious nutritious recipes do me a favor and take a moment to like this video subscribe to the channel and don't forget to hit that notification bell so you never miss a new recipe that helps me continue to create more recipes for you now you may notice that once your frittata is cooked when you pull it out of the oven it's going to be puffed up in the center just like mine is it's totally fine that's just because when you whisk the eggs you might have gotten a bit of extra air in there but you're gonna see as the frittata cools down that the eggs flatten back down and it's gonna look just like this once your frittata is cool enough to handle you can cut it up into slices you could do four pieces six pieces eight pieces i did six today but i will say if you were going to enjoy this as your meal i find cutting it into fours is just perfect so you can serve this on its own you can serve it alongside a nice salad a sweet potato toast really whatever turns you on personally when i'm eating the frittata i love to top it with a little bit of hot sauce just to add a little extra kick it's super light and it's so fresh you guys have got to give this one a try it does not get any easier and or more delicious thanks so much for watching i'm danny spees and i'll see you back here next time with some more clean and deliciousness cheers you", "bQycnA7Tpsw": "now that we're on the cusp of winter it's so nice to look at the progress of the fall garlic that we planted about six weeks ago but what do you do if you didn't plant enough of it or worse you forgot to plant it all together is it really too late yep i'm sorry to say it is can you really grow something like garlic indoors well yes you can and it's actually pretty easy provided you observe a couple of key steps i'll cover it all beginning to end and it starts right now [Music] before we can do anything we have to subject our garlic bulbs to a process called vernalization sounds overly complicated but it really isn't it just means that we have to artificially expose the garlic to cooler temperatures for a defined period of time that is stick it in the fridge for a month to six weeks with our garlic chilling let's go over its life cycle so as to understand why we grow it like we do in cool regions garlic cloves are planted anywhere from four to eight weeks before the first fall frost the goal here is to get established root development with minimal shoot growth before the plants go dormant for up to three months in the spring the garlic has grown for another three to four months until the bulbs reach full size and the shoots begin to fail it's at this time that garlic is harvested and cured for extended storage great now that we know how garlic is traditionally grown we can now see that need for that artificial cooling period for the indoor version planting your chilled garlic is going to be identical to how we'd be planting it outside that is we are going to need a rich well-drained ph neutral potting soil and your container of choice indoor garlic growing usually defaults into container garlic growing simply because most people don't have raised beds or garden plots inside you can grab any of the commercial mixes from the store add in about 10 percent sand and you're good to go i myself have been having a run of bad luck lately with any of the indoor mixes that i bought you know be it from spider mites or just poor growth altogether so i've resorted to making my own it's essentially a 50 50 mixture of compost and coconut fiber add in that 10 sand like we talked about before and then some optional amendments but if you're a diy kind of guy or gal i'll throw a link in the description below on how you can make this potting mix yourself right at home garlic needs a spacing of about four inches minimum between each clove without that spacing you can definitely stunt the size of the bulbs that you're trying to grow so it's really important keep them at least four inches apart with garlic being quite a shallow rooted plant the depth of the pot really doesn't matter anything six inches or so and above you'll be perfectly fine fill your potter container all the way to the top with that soil mix that we talked about before and then compress it down about an inch we're now ready to plant so let's go prep that garlic prepping a garlic ball for planting only takes a few seconds new garlic bulbs are grown from the singular cloves of an existing bulb this is what makes them so easy to grow all we do is separate the individual clothes from the main bulb and remove all the paper coverings except the inner one that's covering the clove itself leave that intact try not to overly pry off those clothes that seem stuck simply move around the bulb to find an easier one eventually they're all going to loosen up and be able to pop off almost on their own i should note that for many of you your garlic may have sprouted at this time don't worry that's completely normal i have some that do some that don't it's not an indicator of a good crop or a bad one now that the garlic cloves are prepped we're ready to plant intuitively garlic is planted root side down that is pointy end up blunt end into the soil plant your cloves by pushing them into that wonderful soil mix that we have about an inch deep with no worry of frost indoors there's no need to plant any deeper again observe that four inch plus spacing pinch the holes closed and our garlic is fully planted fantastic i do tend to mulch my garlic at this point it's an optional step but really it's good gardening practice indoors or out and it does help with mitigating water loss due to evaporation speaking of water go ahead and complete this celebratory last step and water your garlic one good soaking should last your garlic six to eight weeks roughly two months later use the finger test to see how moist the soil is or if you have a moisture meter use that too too dry is better than too wet especially with indoor garlic so keep that in mind within a month you'll likely see your garlic start to sprout if it hasn't already this is great and a sure sign that your cloves are viable at this point the planted garlic will be hanging out with you indoors all winter long [Music] as such it's going to advance far faster than its outdoor counterparts who will likely be in a growth stasis until the spring thaw you can continue to grow it indoors or move it outside once the spring truly hits and you'll be pleasantly surprised when your indoor garlic is actually ready for harvest upwards of three months before the outside stuff your growing buddies will wonder how the heck you're getting garlic bulbs ready for harvest in april a lot of times with gardening growing crops indoors can be more trouble than they're worth it's sometimes easier to simply take the loss and plant the crop on the next go round of its cycle fortunately with garlic the opposite seems to be true it's an easy and low maintenance crop to grow indoors that's actually coupled with an earlier harvest it really makes you wonder if growing garlic indoors isn't actually the superior method in the first place i could literally talk about the ins and outs of garlic

shots on ice are my favorite starbucks drink but they've rebranded to shaken espresso so i ordered their new drink but i ordered i'll just show you how i ordered it right here and this will save you like two dollars if you want blonde espresso which is how it comes change it to blonde espresso i just left it normal espresso because i don't really care so actually i like blonde espresso but you know let's try it i'm not really getting the brown sugar yet maybe if i had a straw oh there it is um can't say i noticed that much of a difference it is literally just a splash so if you like starbucks double shots and ice you would like this [Music] i brought these scones from trader joe's they're like cranberry orange and it looks like there's almonds in them too and i just brought them in a statue bag got some more carrots here are all the snacks that i brought i have some cheese sticks i have some protein bars some little um like smoothie drinks from trader joe's some pomegranate seeds some chomps some salami um uncrustables and carrots and this i'm not necessarily going to eat all in a week but i went ahead and brought it for my room hey i forgot my lunches can you bring them yeah yeah thank you love you bye i forgot my lunches at home which honestly wouldn't have been a big deal because i can make plenty of lunches out of these things here but john also prepped my lunches for me last night while i was grocery shopping and so i was like it's early enough to where he would be here before the kids got here why not just happen brilliant because he was awake this morning so there's that classic mailing move um this stuff is more just for like snacks we have a snack time and the kids eat lunch at home right now and so i'll just grab something like this or in the mornings i can drink one of these i can snack on these so i'm currently doing a little bit of work on my computer but i'm gonna go ahead and eat one of these scones for breakfast my husband actually makes scones that are super good um and so i'm curious if these are gonna be anywhere near as good as his are you can see the yumminess in it wow the flavor really hits you it's good but it's more cakey and not as crumbly as like a scone normally is so i'm gonna say my husband's scones are better but these are still good [Music] it's a little after five o'clock and we're gonna make some of the biscuits we were originally gonna make them yesterday but i guess we got busy so we didn't make them so we have to make them today so we're gonna make them kind of as like a little appetizer we saw them on celina and chef and they looked really good so that's what we're gonna be doing so you do your first layer and then you add your cheese green onions and bacon mixture and then you add your other layer and you do it on top and then you add your third layer and making john do all the hard labor so we don't usually make biscuits but the process for these looks super cool also like i said earlier this recipe is um from tonya holland and we saw it on selena and chef so i'll put a link in the description box to the recipe we're using so one other trick that we learned watching celina and chef was to put a little bit of water on your baking sheet before you put your parchment paper so your parchment paper stays down and i think that's genius i did a pretty poor job of like cutting them out to use the most of our dough but but we did make these little tiny biscuits tesla want some but you can't have any now all we have to do is brush them [Music] okay they just came out of the oven this is what they look like pretty good the top has like a crinkly little little texture to it from the cream they're pretty good they're not life-changing but they're they're pretty good it's about seven o'clock we are gonna make dinner um we were supposed to have rotisserie chicken and carrots last night however um i got stuck in traffic and so i was out super late so we didn't really even have dinner so this is what we were gonna have yesterday notice how we did not make the biscuits so anyways we were gonna have pork tenderloin today with this ravioli that we have and some french green beans but because we have the biscuits it doesn't really make sense to make the ravioli but it is going bad so we are going to cook it and just save it um for like meal prep or lunches or something and then we are gonna have the roasted carrots that we didn't have [Music] all right so we've got oil and salt on the carrots and then they're gonna go in for like 40 minutes and then we'll season off a little bit more i don't know why but that's just what the recipe told me to do so we're gonna do that more more okay our pork is seasoned we well my go-to is usually cajun and i love to make this adobo sauce and if you've watched the channel before you've probably seen me make it but i'm too lazy because that's just gonna be another dish tonight so this is our prep okay we've got our brussels sprouts on the pan you have to make sure whenever you cook brussels sprouts that you put the cut side down so they get nice and crispy they're not ready to go into the oven just yet but we always roast our veggies at 400 degrees olive oil salt pepper garlic onion roast at 400 degrees for like 15 to 20 minutes or until they're cooked the way you like them for me i like them to be a little bit crispy and then for the pork we always put it in a stainless steel pan because we sear the outside and then we transfer into the oven to finish cooking also got to make sure that when you are cooking your pork you get it crispy on the outside on all sides even the side side probably only cooked it for like maybe six or seven minutes just long enough to get it like charred and crispy on the outside and now we're gonna go and put it in the oven brussels sprouts are going in everything is probably has like 20-ish minutes left this is what it looks like after we pulled it out it's been in there for about 15 minutes i totally forgot to flip the carrot or like rotate the carrots and then add the seasonings so i'm doing that now even though it's a little late but i'll put them back in the oven and it'll be okay i've got onion garlic and then we're adding some rosemary these are brussels sprouts this is usually about how done we like them you can see they're like kind of golden on the bottom here's our dinner turn up for tonight i feel like it looks kind of plain without the sauce that we normally have but it's still going to be super super good okay enjoy the carrots first so i'm hoping they're good taste the same as last time still pretty good brussels sprouts delicious mm-hmm what so everything is super good the only thing i'm not a fan of is the cajun seasoning is a brand new bottle we normally buy the like weber grill brand cajun seasoning it's got like a purple label on it super good this stuff not the best cajun seasoning but if you have a good cajun seasoning you like put that on your pork and you'll let it do that but you could also get blackening seasoning and put that on your pork too also i feel like i should say one of the things that has made the biggest difference is learning how to cook vegetables if you're someone who says that they don't like vegetables try cooking them a different way for the longest time i thought i hated cooked carrots you guys know i love raw carrots but i always hated cooked carrots because they're always in things like soups and they just kind of like take on a bad flavor and they get soft and they're not very good i always thought that i hated brussels sprouts because i had always had them steamed no you need to roast your vegetables learn how to roast your vegetables learn how to add a lot of seasoning to them and they're like a hundred times better a hundred times better if you watch my channel if you keep up with my instagram you know that bachelor nights which is monday tonight are usually the nights that we like to have like a little a little special dessert i deserve almost every single night but this is the night where i'm like let's like make a dessert i've been lazy lately and so this is what i bought for this week's dessert i mean you can't go wrong you just can't and you have to eat some of this raw too right [Music] good morning today's tuesday we're going to get started by making some coffee totally thought i was recording when i started the coffee but i wasn't but you guys have seen me do it before [Music] i've been using these little syrup samplers that my sister got me because we ran out of our normal like vanilla syrup but i actually think i want a caramel latte today so normally the only syrup that we buy that's like big which this isn't even the big one this is just like the little one from walmart is vanilla um so yeah i guess we're gonna switch it up and use some of this flavor so i'm gonna put some of this in my mug froth up my milk and then add my espresso in here and then add my milk so it is before school i'm here i have my coffee came out really really good um you guys saw yesterday i had a like a scone for breakfast i used to be a big breakfast person when i was at home and even when i was teaching at home like i love to have a warm breakfast but now that i'm back at school it's just like i'm not i'm just not hungry in the morning so like if i do anything i might eat like a protein bar so that's just how it is for me some days i like breakfast some days i don't sometimes you know i start my day and then an hour into it i'm like dang you know what grits really sound good right now but i'm teaching and i don't have any grit so i can't do that but let me know if you guys eat breakfast before school at school what are your teacher breakfasts because i just am not hungry like i love on a normal like weekend to make delicious things but when i'm going into work it's just that like nothing sounds good for lunch i had the exact same thing i had yesterday so here's a clip and then here's what i had for snack today with the kids and then here is what i had after school just uh a little cliff bar cause i got hungry a lot of times when i'm at school i feel like i need to just constantly be eating that's part of like my relationship with food is that i love to snack so i make sure that i keep them in the classroom so that my mouth can stay busy so that's what i'm doing now i also wanted to make one quick comment about my lunch um this is one that i have for tomorrow it's not heated up [Music] i know that i have other snacks throughout the day that are going to add up okay so it's around six o'clock um we came home worked out i obviously take pre-workout and drink my bcaas but i'm not including that in this video but we originally we're going to make chicken fajitas with our leftover rotisserie chicken but i never got the rotisserie chicken on sunday so we don't have any leftover chicken so we're just going to use some frozen tenders and make some fajitas which when i say fajitas i don't really love mexican food so they're not really fajitas i mean we just don't put cumin cumin i don't i don't know how to say it um okay so we'll say cumin i just the flavor is so overpowering to me and i can't do it so everything else is pretty much the same um just minus the cumin cumin so this is how we do our fajitas it's like a minute later and i was looking for our corn because we were gonna have roasted corn with it and i could have sworn we had like two bags left don't have any roasted corn and then i was like wait a minute do we even have tortillas and no we don't [Music] i mentioned i did rinse my onion in cold water just because it helps with like the crying aspect with white onions and then also my garlic as shoots growing out of it i double checked and sometimes when you get them from the store like this be a little i guess intimidating but people actually cut these up and put them on their food like the actual shoots kind of like you would do like green onions anyways i just chop them up and use them anyway and it's fine some people say like they taste different but i feel like if you cook it you don't notice a difference if i see any little green things in here i'll just take them out but for the most part it's not gonna be a big deal also if it wasn't clear we are still making fajitas um john went to the store he's getting corn and the tortillas that we get so that's just the way it goes sometimes we could have made something else but we were dead set on having fajitas tonight so that's what we're gonna do [Music] okay veggies are cooking and i'm gonna start the yellow rice i just follow the instructions on the package okay so for the veggies we just have pepper chili powder paprika red pepper and some chipotle flakes and then for the chicken i have all that plus cayenne i don't feel the need to put cayenne on the chicken and on the veggies plus we also have that red pepper so that's all the seasoning we have if you are not using fresh onions or fresh garlic then definitely add in garlic powder onion powder but this is everything we're putting in ours [Music] okay veggies are like almost done you're probably thinking amelian why don't you just cook the chicken first and then add the veggies in and the reason is because i just don't like doing it that way so [Music] okay john got corn from the store they didn't have the roasted corn that we like to do but i'm just gonna broil it and it'll be fine and then these are the tortillas that we like to get they're high fiber and they're 50 calories per tortilla they're not like amazing like flour tortillas but they're still good and they're only 50 calories [Music] since we're having fajitas i'll go ahead and show you how i make my margaritas too so we just use this basic tequila and then i like this mr and mrs tease brand that i can only find at walmart but i like it because it's 10 calories per serving then triple sec of course and then a lime just to kind of like amp this up a little bit and then i like to add orange juice but a regular orange works [Music] fine [Music] the chicken is pretty much done now we're going to add the garlic i just don't want to burn the broccoli when you taste test also notice that john has salt in his room and i don't because i don't play the game um so good though a little frothy i didn't say it was a bad thing dang also john said that the tequila that we used um whatever this is is pretty good it was dirt cheap like cheaper than quarterback and cheaper than cuervo and better than corvo so if you can find this maybe try it but we're also not tequila experts okay so here's the corn it wasn't a little steamer bag so i steamed it for like three minutes and then i put it under the broiler and this is what it looks like and we just have salt pepper and a little bit of chili powder on there just to kind of give it that seasoning we're gonna be eating off of my favorite plates they have the little the little curve to make scooping your food easier [Music] here's how our dinner turned out um we only made six tenders but it actually is like so much but here it is so we've got our fajitas yellow rice tortillas roasted corn and some limes so how i like to do it is i like to take my tortilla and put some yellow rice on there no you say you always eat your rice on the side i never said that yes you did yeah at restaurants and then some chicken and veggies let's see who can um get theirs better john went cheese on rice i went rice on chicken on cheese and he's putting queso her does queso i'm really bad at this oh oh oh okay here's mine here's mine she's that off oh she's good no bring it in bring him hmm from far away yours does look better flip it over okay we both suck but it's so spicy [Music] good morning today's wednesday i went ahead and made some just um what do you call it drip coffee and it's raining outside today but this is the bears brothers irish cream coffee i love it it's seasonal but it is it's so good and honestly bears brothers coffee is the best coffee that i've ever had and i said this on my instagram but you know how people say oh like this coffee is really good and you try it and you're like it just tastes like normal coffee to me no this coffee is actually super super good i have a link if you wanna try it it's definitely worth it and you can get sample packs too that are like a dollar or two and you could try all their amazing flavors anyways i am gonna eat my other scone that i brought um from trader joe's this morning once again i will say that my husband's homemade scones are better so we might have to do that in a future video just so just so you guys can see how to make them but i mean this is good for now i'm very [Music] excited so it's like 7 30. i lied earlier because i said we were going to work out but i forgot that i'm taking my rest days on wednesday and saturday so it didn't work out did my nails so today we're going gonna make chicken broccoli and sweet potatoes so we had on our menu and we are really bad about letting our sweet potatoes like just rot i keep them in the pantry and i always forget about them if i'm not like meal planned but i always buy them so we are going to go ahead and chop up all the sweet potatoes because we will be having them a couple nights from now and then we'll have them at some point next week and if you get your sweet potatoes and you just chop them up and put them in the fridge they'll stay good for i don't know like a week and a half two weeks and then you can just pull them out and roast them and it's so much easier and then you don't forget about them and they don't go bad oven is 400 like i mentioned yesterday 400 is what we roast all of our vegetables at so typically what we season anything that we like roast in the oven is salt pepper garlic and onion but with these sweet potatoes we really love that sweet potato gnocchi that i've been eating for lunch every day from trader joe's and it's got like a garlic sage butter sauce on it we tried to make gnocchi sweet odoki from scratch and it wasn't good um i messed it up completely so what i do is i add a little bit of sage and like a little bit of time more sage than thyme to the potatoes and they taste really good they have the same flavor obviously not the same texture because it's not gnocchi gnocchi but really really good these are leftover potatoes we're not doing anything special literally just putting them in an airtight container also i forgot to mention when i got home between then and now i've had some santia's chips just the chips because i don't need salsa [Music] the potatoes have been in for about 25 minutes i'm going to give them a little tossy flip and then i'm going to add broccoli to the pan and put them in it for another like 20. [Music] my camera battery died so i'm switching to my phone for just like a hot sec so the chicken has been cooked we added the peppers back into it so we cook the chicken separately and then add the peppers back in on the chicken we have onion black garlic this is from trader joe's it's new to me but it's really good and then we have oregano on the chicken and then salt and pepper and thyme as well that's how that looks this is what our veggies look like so again the sweet potatoes have been in there for about like 45 minutes broccoli has been in there for like 25 minutes give or take just for fun here's two different plating options you can mix it all together or you can do a kind of like vertical thing like this one over here i prefer this one which we actually weren't planning on putting in the peppers and i decided last minute since we were doing it in bold style that would be really good and we have orange red and yellow peppers but i thought since the sweet potatoes were orange we should use red and yellow peppers so then we have all the colors anyway so this is how tonight's dinner it turned out looks super good [Music] okay still on my phone but we're going to taste it but he never has anything incredible to say it's good it looks good i really do feel like the black garlic does make a difference so if you go to trader joe's pick it up try it a little veggie action happening mushy with just a little bit of crisp and they have the same taste that like like i said the nokia does just by putting that sage on there so definitely try it okay so john and i are playing this game and i was like okay i want dessert so i went and grabbed our fudge pops which i know that these fudge pops are only 40 calories like it says on the front 40 calories what i did not know is that a serving size is three pumps hilarious anyways these are really good and i'm gonna have one [Music] good morning it's thursday i was going to make a latte at home this morning and i just said no we're going to starbucks so i got a cinnamon dolce latte but i got it with a little bit of white mocha um here's specifically like how i ordered it it is absolutely freezing this morning i love cinnamon dolce and white mocha i love cinnamon dolce and toffee nut like white mocha and toffee not any of those combos like those three flavors they do something for me i also brought a cup to put it in because i usually am not great about finishing it right away i almost got um like that double smoked bacon and cheddar or that the hammond swiss croissant and i was like i really don't need that this morning so i'm probably gonna wait like 20 or 30 minutes and eat one of my one up protein bars like right before the kids get here because i feel like i need to eat something this morning i know in a lot of these videos you see people like making their breakfast every morning but like when you need to be at work super early in the morning like it's just not super realistic and i don't make breakfast most of the time before i leave the house i was actually craving something warm today which is why i said i almost got a sandwich but i didn't so yeah i'll see you guys later so i enjoyed my coffee this morning i did end up having one of my 1up protein bars this is the kind that i like it's s'mores [Applause] it's so good then for my snacks that i normally eat with the kids i had some more of my salami then i had one of these string cheeses from trader joe's and i had some of my pomegranate seeds that i got from trader joe's and so funny because some of my kids were like miss call i love those and i was like i know they're my favorite too so good so i'm gonna finish these off tomorrow um that was my snack super good honestly i could have this every single day then after school i had some of my carrots and then my husband brought me a like spare computer cord so i can leave one here and have one at home because i'm really bad at that but he brought me a corndog from sonic because it's 50 cent corn dog day or hour i don't know but he brought me that so that was a surprise and i ate that and then i got distracted and busy i've literally been working non-stop after school and i did not eat my actual lunch which is fine because i can just eat it tomorrow i didn't have anything prepped for tomorrow so that works out i did have a protein bar just now i know i had one of these here's the thing would it have been better if i had eaten my lunch that meal prepped yes it would have but this is why i keep things in the classroom because it's better to just like eat a quick something that's not terrible for you versus being so busy that you don't eat at all so that's how today went so it's about 6 45 we're gonna make dinner we're actually making one of my favorite meals ever and john's too it's the italian sausage pasta and i made this in a video you can click up here it's the cook with me video five of my favorite meals and i went into detail on how to do it and i also have the full recipe linked below so i might not be super specific when i show you tonight but it is my favorite meal first i want to show you guys my favorite way to get sausage out of its casing if you're still cutting the casing off of sausage you need to see this hack because it's my favorite thing ever and i don't know why more people don't do it or don't know about it just for reference we are using this hot italian sausage i always buy it when i go to trader joe's so for this to work you need to have a hot water or warm water what you're gonna do is run it under warm water and you're gonna slowly kind of rub the casing off and it should come off super easy [Music] the pasta that i'm using is orgeti or kitty is my favorite pasta it's got this like cup shape and it just like hugs the sausage perfectly i really really like the kind from trader joe's but the reason i like this kind is because the noodles the pasta is thicker than the other brands that i've had which really i've just had like walmart brand but if you get it you need to make sure that it's like thick pasta because that's that's what makes it so good too maybe i just like this i think it's this and just look at the texture of this pasta doesn't that look like something you want to eat it looks like ice cream almost salty like the sea if you know where that's from we can be best friends [Music] [Music] here's what the sausage onions pepper spinach looks like you could tell i added a ton of spinach in here and it looks like almost nothing like i'm tempted almost to add more but i'm not going to um our pasta is done i drained it i did save some pasta water here i almost forgot but i remembered so now what we're going to do is combine the pasta and the rest of it add the water and parmesan and make a little sauce and then i also like to go back in and season the sauce as well also if you make this make sure that you don't cook your pasta like 100 because it does need to sit for probably like 10 minutes we're gonna probably let it sit while we shower so that's going to be like 15 or 20 minutes because the longer it sits the better it tastes so don't cook your pasta completely because it's going to cook a little bit more [Music] so if i move it you can see kind of how much liquid is in here right now we're going to add the parmesan [Music] sometimes i add a little bit of this grated parmesan if i want to thicken it up just a little bit so if you don't nail the pasta water ratio and it sits for a little while and you want it to be a little bit thicker just add some of that and it kind of helps so we're gonna put this on low and cover it okay let's take a look oh yeah that's gonna be good that is exactly [Music] all right and here is how it turned out um i did garnish it with a little bit of parsley and i added a little bit more pepper on top and some chipotle flakes because we love them but it tastes i promise it tastes ten times better than it looks and it looks really good okay we're gonna taste it even though we both this is one of this is like my favorite meal every time it's this good every time delicious as always so good if you make one thing from this video i'm not lying i could eat that whole pot like it's that good something else really important about this dish is if you make it make plenty of it because the leftovers fantastic this dish is so good heat it up so yeah definitely try 10 out of 10. we love it also i have one more thing to say with tesla in the shot this dish technically has fruits and veggies in it because there's peppers and a ton of spinach so we've got the other major food group of cheese and [Music] good morning it's 6 a.m on friday i'm gonna brew some coffee i was gonna make a latte but honestly i just feel like normal basic coffee so let's pick one out i think i'm gonna go with this one by bears brothers i have a link in my description if you want to try them and i feel like i've already talked about them in this video but this one is streusel cake it's one of my favorites um and i think this will be this will be really good for today [Music] i also said yesterday at school how much i really wanted a hot breakfast so i think i'm gonna make some oatmeal yeah like i'm not hungry now but i know as soon as that oatmeal is done i'll be happy it's just weird for me to eat like so early in the morning [Music] so i went ahead and put my oatmeal in this yeti just so it stays warm i have actually eaten some already this is what it looks like it's a little hard to tell but it came out super good i'm gonna take that i actually really like this and taking a couple bites of that made me feel like a lot better i made it to the costume i'm gonna eat my oatmeal i don't know i felt the need to come on and tell you but i'm gonna eat my oatmeal and then make coffees which you'll hear about if you watch the weekly vlog from this week i forgot how good my homemade oatmeal is so good so i tried to show you when i was making it but all i do is i add in cinnamon and then some cinnamon roll flavor seasoning from flavor god and it's really really good i have a link in my bio if you've never tried flavor god but i would honestly get it just for the cinnamon roll some people put it in their coffee i should have tried that this morning because i made the streusel coffee and i put just a little bit of stevia for sweetness and then a pinch of salt to balance it out and then i added in the wet ingredients so milk and then butter um vanilla extract i feel like it makes a really big difference and that's it it's the end of the damn friday here's what i had for a snack um just some salami some carrots and cheese stick and then after school i had a chomps stick i actually got super hair away with school and meetings and just like everything i had to do and mostly talking and i completely completely forgot to make my lunch until i was like oh it's time to go so i brought the lunch that i was gonna eat today home because i do need to eat it um but yeah so today not the best day but that's okay also i feel like it's important for me to be like honest and share that with you guys especially if you are a teacher because how many times do we forget to eat how many times at least at least once a week so again just being real just being honest just letting you guys know some days like i forget to eat lunch or i run out of time or i don't have time to like make breakfast or i don't have time to like do whatever so that's just how it goes some weeks and that's okay it's been like a second for you but it's been many hours for me so it's almost seven o'clock and we're going to be making tri-tip which is my favorite steak ever and now that we're in california it's so easy to get so tri-tip we're also making brussels sprouts and we're making some of those sweet potatoes that we chopped up two nights ago so potatoes are going in the oven the same way we prepared them last time actually i might leave out the sage this time i might just make them like basic seasoning [Music] for the steak we're gonna do salt pepper garlic and onion [Music] [Music] john um grilled the steak outside and then we're gonna put it in the oven for a little while just to finish cooking [Music] the veggies brussels sprouts are probably there for a little too long [Music] okay here is tonight's dinner so it's tri-tip sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts um which actually works out nice that this is my dinner today because like i said i didn't really the lunch that i packed i just had other stuff and there will be plenty of tri-tip left over if i want it which i probably will i will say because i don't want anyone to to make any judgments here the steak is a little bit overcooked it's a little bit overcooked but that's okay and also john and i decided that from now on we're gonna call these cube fries how's the cute fry delicious not cute cute fries also one more thing i want to point out is i do like the sear you get when you cook the tri-tip in a pan versus cooking it on a grill john doesn't like cook it on a pan if we can help it because it smokes up the whole house so that's why we grilled it but the pan sear is a much better option and then just transferring it to the oven like that my microphone is turning around so sorry for the audio but it'll be okay for three seconds i just love it it's good so many better comment down below what your favorite steak is if budget like wasn't a thing and you had to choose one what would you pick because i would pick tri-tip well okay i might pick filet mignon flamingo is really good one day he fed it to me he fed it to me one day he made it and i thought it was sirloin but i was really hungry and it was like really good and i ate it in like two seconds i was like wow that was amazing he was like you just ate a whole filet and i was like now i'm gonna be snacking on some of these trader joe's dark chocolate covered blueberries we've had the dark chocolate covered cherries and they're amazing these blueberries are amazing and my favorite are the they're i think they're dark chocolate covered um coconut almond like they're like almond joys but they're super super good [Music] good morning it's saturday and well it's actually one in the afternoon i've been editing all morning john's been really tired but i've been begging him to do breakfast actually i wanted donuts but that's not happening so maybe we can get donuts tomorrow but we're gonna have some sausage some toast and some eggs just a normal classic breakfast i am also going to make some coffee too so happy saturday you guys have seen this before i keep it in one of these bitter homes and gardens containers with the little scoop inside and we keep it in our fridge i'm just going to take this and fill up my bioletti okay so she's filled with water the espresso powder is in there whenever we were in italy which is where we like first saw these because we were in airbnbs and they all like prepped these for us um they said not to like push down on the espresso powder which i know like typically like you would do so this is just the way that i do it i don't push it down too much and then we put it on our stove which you guys have seen me do this a couple of times before but i just wanted to like talk you through it a little bit more because i keep getting questions about it so we're just going to put it on the stove espresso will start to come through the top [Music] okay our sausage is done and i know a lot of people will like pour their grease into like a little jar and we used to that too but recently not recently like a year ago or something years okay well we learned this hack where you can put paper towels like in the grease once it's cooled down for like a second and then it'll absorb it and then you can just throw the paper towels away if you want because you can't pour grease in your sink you can't put grease like in your trash can so if you do it like this i mean it works the trick that i've learned recently is to keep our bread in the freezer because if you can't eat it fast enough and you're just gonna use it for something like toast it toasts perfectly fine just pulling it straight from the freezer so i'm really glad i learned that and by recently i mean i've been doing it for like two years i just have no concept of time [Music] also if you know me you know that i don't just butter my toast i melt the butter and put it on my chest so for our drinks this morning i'm gonna make us some lattes i'm just gonna be using vanilla syrup yeah i do okay so i'll put some caramel in there too okay we're gonna pour however much espresso you want in your drink i'm just gonna pour mine in my cup here for john then we're gonna froth up some milk [Music] [Music] and i like break the rules because i like to do this i don't know if there's a name for it i just like makes mixing it all up for john's i foamed it or frothed it up a lot more he likes more foam than i do not really a film person here's my melted butter i did kind of like overcooked my toast a little bit okay i burned it a little bit but that's okay wasn't intentional but that's okay um yeah so this is our breakfast this morning my eggs just have everything seasoning and then a little bit of cheese i've got my toast got my sausage i'm going to eat my breakfast and finish editing this week's classroom vlog if you've seen it let me know because it should be up poor tesla is always left out of our breakfast she's always left out so it's after seven um i'm still wearing my pajamas uh pretty much the only thing that we've done all day is eat breakfast like i'm literally in the same spot doing the same thing coffee is very cold um but john so far has started prepping our meats and veggies so tonight we're making one of like my favorite super fun meals we're doing fondue we're gonna do kind of like melting pot style where we cook like our veggies and our meats in broth so yeah i'm excited here's our little fondue pot we're gonna be using chicken stock and pretty much are gonna be weighing the rest of it i can't remember what recipes that we've used in the past for it so we're just gonna throw in just a bunch of delicious seasonings and things a little bit of oil in our pot and we're gonna go ahead and cook up some onions also i almost forgot but we have these little potatoes for it too very excited that i remembered and we're kind of weaning it so i'm gonna do some of this marsala in there do you think that's good we're gonna let it like reduce a little bit so maybe that much that's probably enough for like the flavor okay so we've seasoned it with salt pepper a little bit of red peppers and then i added a little bit more of this like chicken broth powder just to kind of amp up the flavor of our actual broth so everything in there looks good to go do us good trader joe's which was good we're also throwing in some green onions just because we had them in our fridge so why not that looks good though this whole all right we have a bubble putting the potatoes in first so they can cook up while we wait for our other food to cook [Music] so we have our timer going so we can make sure because it's hard to tell like whenever you're just sitting here how much time has passed but we know like approximately like how long it's going to take for these to cook so that's our little tip [Music] i don't think i told you what we have but we obviously have our broth and you saw us make that and then we have some fresh broccoli um because normally we just keep frozen and then john has some mushrooms over there and then we have those little potatoes in there too and then we have chicken and filet mignon for our meat that's our little potato broccoli mushroom scooper we forgot we love to dip it in teriyaki melting pot gives you a few different sauces but teriyaki it makes it good [Music] so this is this feels like one of those um like team team building activities like you should need to cook fondue with one of your co-workers are you trying to get people converted it is about 11am on sunday um mostly because of daylight savings time i hate it not happy about it but i originally thought we were going to make breakfast here or we were going to go get some donuts but john said we should go get some brunch so very excited last time they brought us the champagne and orange juice on the side which is the best way but this time okay this time we got it the way we had last time he brought us the champagne this is the berry like jam dip and then this is the custard that's super good these are the cute little beignets and then what i did last time is i took all almost all of the fruit because it's still really good in the little dips but i put it in my mimosa to make it extra delicious [Music] john says this is bad etiquette but if you've served before you know i've got the chicken marsala pasta is it good and i got the filet mignon pasta i did pick out all of the mushrooms because i'm not a mushroom person but this is what i had last time and i really liked it also i got extra parmesan cheese this time lunch was delicious technically is french because we were eating at like noon here are the donuts we got and here's the cute little shots we got a couple of the cookie craze john got a banana rama we have a maple a normal glaze and then a cinnamon sugar and we got some bavarian cream shots adults a dulce de leche shot and a strawberry shot this is the banana one that john got i'm gonna try the cinnamon one with the with a dolce shot so you insert and inject do a little bit just a little bit you use that that's right oh really okay it's kind of hard to get in this one i'm gonna try the cookie craze oh gosh the funny thing is like i don't love bavarian cream but getting to inject it myself makes me want to eat it more i'm gonna try some maple let's do it with some do you think they'll say to let you be good or bad probably good right do a little dulce de leche in there it's so fun to do it like this drama saying last night about um melting power about fondue like why is stuff like that so fun and he was like we like to work for our food and i think i think that's very true i know this is what i eat in a week video i wanted to show you some of the snacks that we got from trader joe's um just that we're going to have in the house actually this one is for bachelor night tomorrow we're going to try these log cakes from trader joe's and then picked up a couple chomps for me and john we're back in stock with our ghost pepper chips which are our face so we got a couple bags of those and then we got some of these oh babe we should try the ginger candy we got some of the the chocolate selections so these are the coconut ones i like these are the blueberry ones that i was eating i think this week these are the cherry ones that you guys have seen us eat before so we stocked up on these just to have them and then john thought that these ginger ones sounded good so i actually i want to try them i don't think i've ever had ginger as a candy i'm not from [Music] it's very ginger one final thought on the donuts our favorite donut or at least i think your favorite donut is krispy kreme donuts i think that the best doughnuts um these donuts are good but they're not like blow your mind good they're not very good to be honest but these but these are fun so tonight for dinner we're gonna be making this barbecue chicken teriyaki um it is from trader joe's um it says trader mings because it's chinese food in case you've never shopped there before this is what it is john and i have never had this one before just the orange chicken which is super good and then the kung pao chicken which i think is my current favorite so hopefully this one is good john also says the beef and broccoli is [Music] good [Music] so trader joe's is telling me to put this in a bowl with plastic on top of it which is strange because normally they'll give you like stovetop instructions but they don't um so i'm gonna try to cook it in a stasher bag and i'm gonna leave it like a little bit open i don't know maybe i should close it i'm going to try it and see how that goes also i've never had jasmine rice before just my husband he got it for his curry that he makes um it smells so good the rice i think is pretty much done i never time it i just like check it to see but i always worry about burning it so this looks good broccoli honestly needs like another 10 minutes looks like this after like five minutes in the stasher i left like a very very tiny slit yeah i think that that cooks fine [Music] all right i think we're ready to plate it up there's a lot of liquid in here i don't know i guess i thought it would be oops i thought it would be thicker uh but it's not so i guess that'll be good for like our rice because it'll like get in there [Music] okay here's how our dinner turned out so you can't really see the rice underneath but it's there and then the only extra thing that i did was put some red pepper flakes on that is it okay we're trying this one for the very very first time the first one we ever had was the orange chicken we were like wow this is pretty good then we had the kung pao chicken we were like wow this is really good and then you had the other one the broccoli beef and broccoli and he liked that one i don't think i had it but overall we do still agree that it tastes better than when you go to like one of those like buffet chinese restaurants so still really good and also one of my favorite things to cook if you just don't feel like cooking because this can be done in like 20 minutes so and that's just because the broccoli i like the rice though oh good you guys need to try jasmine rice and if you knew about it why didn't you tell me you", "B-kiYnmG_7w": "[Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] and start that again good evening everybody and welcome to tonight's kinetic cycle coach podcast i am your coach captain pilot bus driver taxi driver for the evening and i don't need to tell you what my name is because it's scott and it's in the corner of the screen as you can see so we're going to talk about carbohydrates tonight um and peter's already gone on spoiled the bubble that most cake is actually full of fat and not carbs but i might actually pop your bubble as well about your caffeine stock but anyway i'm not going to put too much all of the wind up your sails i'm going to introduce you to some ways that you may not have looked at carbohydrates before but we're essentially going to leave this session with a clear idea of what changes you're going to make okay so you're gonna love it pop in your chat pop in all your questions we'll work with way through i can see all the members in their orange strava jerseys all jumping on doesn't that look very cool hey folks you stick with me for the year you'll get up to that till the french yellow premium jersey and that brings me on to a very important topic oh i've just kicked my camera sorry about that before we actually go on and that is how do you become a member because it's not that easy is it here's silly me thinking that i would just put the join badge on apparently ios is not friendly with it and you're not going to see it on your phone you have to go to a website youtube you have to go ideally on a laptop desktop you'll find it as you can see there in the banner i'll just put my little chin where's wally oh wrong hand put that one up it's just down there you got to go on the laptop or a desktop and you'll find it i'm going to be sending out a link via email so if you're a subscriber already to the newsletter hey you're going to get that through and then you can easily follow it what you're going to get in membership are you going to get the live training sessions on the cat shop because as of this week they're all going into membership folders okay and that just keeps everything exclusive and the way i want it how much is memberships 4.99 a month so it's not you know it's not going to break the bank and that's the sort of fees that youtube set and they will get most of it i'll tell you that anyway but that's going forward from this week you're also going to get live chat where i'm going to talk about things like this deeper nutrition but also products i'll be back in my big fit studio very very soon products get thrown at me all the time from all sorts from bike components from bike fit issues bike components computers nutrition and i'll drop it into the membership group first and you will be notified when that happens okay so without further ado let's talk cake [Applause] so start dropping in your favorite cake what is it now you can start putting it in the comments get a little chat amongst yourself i'm going to break this up into a couple of little points okay uh so i want you thinking about your present habits so i'm going to go through quite a couple of things tonight so i want to talk about everything you ever wanted to know about carbs but were too afraid to ask what why what when why i was going to put the where but folks i hope you know that it's carbs in here we're not talking about supposed trees up your backside for carbohydrate uh inducing we're not talking about intravenous carbs no no no no all ones that go in your mouth so uh do you need to change so after tonight's chat i want you to go away and look now i'm going to keep it as simple as possible but i want you to look at your own structure and see if you need to change okay so i'm going to give you a bit of science to begin with folks i thought it'd be easier we get sort of a little bit sciencey get that out of the way and that'll get you thinking in terms of numbers now the most important thing is you've got to keep this simple right do not leave this podcast thinking i've got to count so many numbers i've got to get no you're going to work on feel okay but you're going to get an idea where you're at at the present and what changes you need to make so i'm going to share quite a little bit of thing so bear with me get a notepad and pen or you can watch this through i'm going to flash up some numbers flash up some foods flash up my structure and its loose terms and how we can follow that in a week okay so what about if i was to say to you uh how much so how much glycogen is in the system i'm going to use a random basic what we call janet and john figgers so muscle's going to hold round about 500 grams of glycogen glycogen remember is about an 8 to 12 chain glucose simple simple sugar that's going to break down and that's what food is going to be converted to boom straight away within about an hour believe it or not folks yeah within about an hour so let's call the average person 500 grams it's gonna range between three and seven hundred depending on the size of that person and their level of fitness yes people the fitter you get the more glycogen you can store liver we're going to have on average about 80 grams now that can range from zero to 160 yes zero we can completely deplete the lever blood okay that's not my phone single phone signal 4g that is about it okay four grams in the blood scott you're kidding is that it yeah now i'm not putting in brackets how much because i don't want to get into the realms of uh diabetes etc and all that okay so that's about it so does that give you an idea uh now before we go on does anybody know how many calories without googling it is in a gram of carbohydrate if you've been following the podcast you probably know already that you can oxidize one gram per minute roughly so i want you thinking about that and i want you thinking about what did you have or you're about to have for your evening meal okay i don't want you to count how many carbohydrates are in it but i'm going to be asking you about the volume the size the portion and when did you last eat as an athlete i want you thinking about your training and your eating in similar sorts of timelines because nutrition timing and the volume of the nutrients we take is important pre during and post okay so have a think about that keep putting in your favorite cakes yeah i've got a fetish is that are you allowed to say fetich on on youtube for certain cakes carrot cake is up there very very high but there are a few others millionaires shortbread oh a lot of fat in that though okay so with those levels what about the old coach so the cold coach weighs 64 kilograms of one carb oh i've given you the answer there four calories i'm going to go roughly four calories we talk about a flashlight if we talk about protein at four calories carbohydrate normally about three and a half three and three quarters i just round it up to four what about fat okay i'll leave you with that one how many calories in a gram of fat hmm i'll leave you with that i won't give you the answer to that one yet okay so where's the coach at so let's say coach weighs 64 grams and we take the upper limits okay so we take those sort of average we take the 500 we take the 80 and we take the 4. so i've got 584 grams of potential carbohydrate in my system if i am fully fueled so that gives me a potential of four times five eight four gives me two hundred and two thousand three hundred and thirty six calories interesting two hundred two thousand three hundred thirty six calories potential if i'm full okay so it's quite interesting you probably never thought about that how many calories have i got at the moment now we don't know because we haven't got a gasoline petrol guider when we go to eat we haven't got a bar chart on our wrist or or our leg that says hey just like your phone your three bars full scott go lie down eat 15 bits of carrot cake three kitkats bowl of pasta and you'll be okay we don't have that so we have to learn from experience now the reason i said that more people sort of the higher level of fitness you've got the higher you'll be able to hold this is all to do with lean tissue and our absorption of glycogen which changes the more training we've done so if you're a beginner and you're an absolute beginner there's something i want to go through that will be advantage for you if you're looking to lose weight okay depending on how much training you've done so you've got that amount of calorie scope what does that mean why is that going to be beneficial to me to understand well if we get a fueling issue whereby our legs start to burn our inflammation is going up our heart rates not corresponding with the effort that we feel we've got a resting heart rate that's gone up we're feeling tired we're not having a good sleep pattern all symptoms of high inflammation which are usually symptoms of somebody who's in metabolic shock or somebody who's falling under daily calories so what's my bmr it's around about 1600. so i need 1600 calories per day to break even okay to break even now my devices if i wear a heart rate monitor that's going to be very accurate for where use a power meter it's going to be more accurate and it'll tell me how many calories i'm bonding if my metrics are all correct in terms of my threshold my heart rate's ones and it'll tell me if i ride for three hours at below 80 percent ftp i will burn on average about 1600 calories okay i'll weigh out my bmr number okay so that means i'm depleting the carbohydrate in my system so it means i have to replace it i've talked about this before if you do not replace it and we'll go through replacement numbers in a second if we don't replace it and replace it pretty quick okay within the first hour we must get a particular percentage normally 1 to 1.3 grams ideally that's 60 to 90 grams a little bit more than what we would normally take if we were training in that first hour then we're going to be in trouble because we're going to always be playing catch up and what will happen to some people is they'll feel it on the second day or they may even feel it on the third or the fourth day and there'll be a huge slump of fatigue a big pinprick and a balloon and they will blow up they'll feel irritable they will have a poor sleep pattern poor concentration lots of symptoms that are unique to them some will be more than others we can have five people that are in metabolic shock and they'll all behave slightly different but they'll mainly be editable poor energy levels lack of motivation lots of fatigue so i want you to think now here am i falling into that trap because i'm trying to lose weight so i'm i'm i'm counting my calories now if your muscle and liver let's say your total glycogen let's keep it simple falls to 50 so let's say it falls under 250 grams that's it okay it's game over you will not be able to fuel properly the reactions needed in the muscles to actually train to hit the new levels to actually push your fitness you'll still be able to move but you'll go slower you'll feel sluggish there'll be very heavy legs not good eh not good all because you're trying to cut back on the calories you're putting in now remember what i said at the start protein is going to give you the same amount of calories in fact it's a little bit more per gram than carbohydrate the reason we use carbohydrate first is the the the bonds between the glucose the carbons are really really easy to break down so it breaks down fast then protein fats complex it takes about four times as much oxygen to break down a gram of fat than it does to break down a gram of carbohydrate so it doesn't like going there very simple it just wants smooth efficiency so we'll go for what's ready fast then it'll go for the proteins then it'll go for the fats once you start using protein game over and as far as training goes absolute game over so if for example you are somebody who uh i would say belongs to the clan of there's a scottish clan called mcmoron yeah the mcmorons tend to follow things that are quite trendy and in sports terms having something that has a no sugar or no glucose that this is going to be okay for a small period of time and then before you go start crazy you start chewing on your fingers you start eating uh books and pencils you start trying to get anthony that's the mcmoron clan yeah we don't want to become part of that because how can we chemically induce the reactions needed for sport if we haven't got a fully loaded muscle and liver system of of carbohydrate i.e glycogen now remember all foods going to get broken down into that within an hour to four hours you're already storing a lot of it as fat okay oh scott don't mention that word that's that's a bad word okay we'll come to that don't worry don't worry right so get that in your head are you feeling enough for the exercise so if you're a beginner and you're looking to lose weight one tip keep your right short don't go beyond the two-hour point whereby fuel is going to start running out okay so we'll get on to timing a second but this may be of like total uh oh scott you're swearing at me i love those long rides but if we're going to do the long rides you're going to have to fuel with carbohydrates quite a lot of them okay so where did we get to so uh carbohydrates we rushed through this you know where they can i want to do this as a little example i want you to look closely at them and see what happens when i go through all the groups now i'm going to share my my 100 best foods with you as well some of you have seen it before and where we get them so carbohydrates fruits grains or beans veg sugary sweets yeah milks day oh milk it's got dairies yeah cycling specific sport food i call it this is essential for me so this is something i will have in my diet especially in protein what about fats so dairy products would that include milk scott oh might do yeah seeds nuts oils meat if you're a meat eater uh tofu i'm talking about things that are quite common to me and then let me see what about what have i missed your favorite facts okay oh no i've done that i mean proteins oh oh look scott milk's prepared again dairies okay it's meats lentils seafood for me this is where my sports product would come in as well because i'm not getting enough protein in my my daily diet as well and i know that okay right so i'm going to say one thing here confused that there are items in multiple categories you should be confused because it is very confusing and i think sometimes the media make it confusing for you so that you're going out and buying their products because they will give you an answer to everything and one of the most confusing things is at the moment the i think even toothpaste has got protein in it i think if they could get away with it coffee with protein tea bags with protein everything's got protein in it at the moment well we want protein but we're getting quite enough of that we want carbohydrates and we want them to be able to fuel okay so really important where are you getting yours confusing i've put dairy products and all of them is called how do i know how good the carbohydrate is how do i know that i'm getting enough you're going to do on feel to begin with because there's a couple of things we'll go through in the summary because start of it you know where you're at don't you you know what your metrics are what your weight is your fat muscle and water because remember when we take on carbohydrates let's say for every gram of carbohydrates we take on four times as much water so when i talk about carbohydrates i'm going to talk about fluid retention i'm going to talk about let's call it puffy puffiness you know you're going to puff up with a lot of carbohydrates and you're going to need them when you're going into bigger events longer events before and after but there's nutritional timing okay where you turn that all off and you'll flush that out and particular types of efforts we do we'll flush that out oh scott you're talking so fast slow it all down like let me summarize that so your carbs can come from more than just carbohydrates so foods that you see as carbohydrates don't let the media confuse you we're going to get them but we're going to get them in different levels so you've all heard of starchy carbohydrates yeah more complex carbohydrates things like our porridge potatoes forms of pasta so these are slow releasing carbohydrates okay now for for those slow releasing ones they're not actually ideal for us pre-exercise because they're going to take a lot more oxygen to break down and be a bit slower okay so what's going to happen when we have a high influx of your favorite cake so let's say what we got we've got all sorts of cakes going in there french gingerbread oh i like the sound of that so you know that when we get sugar we get spiking insulin okay that insulin then will drop and we can that can come with a feeling of safe fatigue so say you go into your coffee stop and you're really looking forward to your favorite cake which let's be honest folks hasn't it's got full of carbohydrates but it's also full of fats okay now when you have it and then you set about talking about hey did you see that guy scott mclean that podcast what a funny he is oh he goes on and on and on he talks about that he start talking away 10 minutes has passed 50 minutes past suddenly your insulin spike's gone boom down deflated you go back on the bike you think oh my god it's always hard when you leave the cafe bobby isn't it oh i know jimmy oh my legs are just killing me yeah i don't want to like blow like a raspberry to your cafe stop but if you're looking to maximize a coffee stop and you're out with some friends when lockdown finishes do it very close to home okay not many people do that we'll go halfway and we'll have a nice big catch up then we'll put her on back not if you're training you're not you'll probably want to go hard okay so bear that in mind all right that's just a little side point we'll save for another little chat so anyway i want you to think about that the volume in the in the muscles we've got four calories per gram how do we know that we're we're fully stored okay well we're going to have to experiment with some workouts and how we feel and how we perform okay but if you are in a position right now where you're counting calories and for a woman if you're under that 1200 a day and for a man if you're under 1400 a day  okay in fact it's working that is if you're in that party and you belong to the mcmoron clan and you've fallen into that trap then you've got to make sure that that is not a training day and you're doing shorter workouts to accommodate the weight loss okay now doing weight loss and specific cycling i'll touch on it but it's a it's a different a total different topic okay but you'll pick up from when i talk about uh timing let me let me go into say looking at uh a typical week yeah so let's go through sort of a week let me let me share something like this so that this is not uh this is not rocket science i don't want to give too much away because obviously okay i like to share all the real juicy stuff with my team kinetic people but let's look at the coach so monday off so what we're doing on a monday well we're rolling over from the sunday breakfast uh will be no extra carbs needed for that breakfast and i'll start on a monday by adding more fats and proteins into the diet because i don't need the carbs on monday all right i don't need as much pm i'll start to add a little bit more carbs okay tuesday uh there's gonna be high intensity 90 minutes zone four zone five hard work okay so we have double breakfast now what does a double breakfast mean it means what time do you get up so my breakfast will be consumed porridge okay normally quite a large bowl okay one full cup and not a half cup there'll be honey added as well and that will be consumed between 6 30 and 6 45 definitely before seven o'clock every morning so therefore when there is a morning training i will do an easy uh ride on an indoor bike after never ever before i do not want to get into fasted riding i'll do it after and then what will happen that may be half an hour okay it doesn't happen every tuesday but about half an hour 40 minutes then i'll do a double breakfast around about 10 o'clock i'll have another breakfast that might be specific carb loaded so it may be something like a piece of toast or flatbread with jam okay i'll avoid putting flora or butter and i'll be jam and i'll just have that around about that ten o'clock time now now what i am doing is i am now eating in court in coordination with cycling using the two hour rule to keep my carbohydrate levels as high as possible i am assuming that even when i'm off the bike i am dipping into those stores and i'm burning a lot of them every two hours and i'm falling under so i have it in my head i'll go to half every 200 every two hours sorry and i'll build it back up wednesday so if we look in the evening i do what's called a later carb lunch and then i follow the two-hour rule so we'll come back to the two-hour real soon a pm is a sports protein after the training and with some carbs no large meal nope that doesn't happen i'll pick that up in the very next day so breakfast is normal wednesday we follow family meal protocol okay for me so that's a normal meal so there's nothing extra happening on a wednesday uh depending on how i feel or what i've replaced there is quite a large lunch now thursday i'll normally do hard the longer efforts again 90 minutes maybe two hours so again i follow double breakfast because there may be a session fee in the morning just to activate again there's later carb lunch and then the two-hour rule and then again i don't have an evening meal okay so i don't have it doesn't matter if i'm got time eight o'clock i just avoid it i'll have a sports protein shake and i will have some carbs maybe in a bit of a slice of toast maybe some cereal friday's off so i have my similar routine to monday but then i start to add more carbs in the evening saturday will normally be two to four hours hard push and basically i call it the world car buffet you know eat all you want trying to get as many carbs in as possible pre i will make sure that the breakfast is consumed within the two-hour period of going out but i'll also have a liquid about an hour before i'm going out as well and then there's high carbs in the evening high carbs in the morning sunday's an easy session and then we shift the proteins and fats after five o'clock sunday night as i start to fully recharge and get into recovery mode okay now monday i may do a simple little ride and i may just turn the legs now does that seem complex it shouldn't do i want you to go and look at your weekly schedule when are you having breakfast i don't have breakfast scott well the mcmoron bus will come by your house and it will collect you and it will take you to mcmoron clap camp where you can live happily with all the other morons now make sure you're having breakfast is it consistent what are you consuming for breakfast is it a light breakfast or are you making sure that you're really fueling up because remember if the two-hour rule of expenditure of carbohydrates when we're out on the bike is used in your head scott sleep is eight hours six hours so we've gone through three or four cycles with no fuel so i want you to imagine that you are waking up with your glycogen muscle and liver and blood stores below 50 so it's impossible to do a high intensity effort and people say to me can i do a high intensity effort in the morning yeah but you won't necessarily get the numbers that your fitness deserves because you haven't got the the volume of glycogen okay you got that so start getting some sensible thinking in your head you don't need to go googling everything you don't need to go you just need to understand that this is what my body needs this is where it's bundling up and this is how i'm going to replace it so you start to look at your schedule and you see when am i having lunch what am i having for lunch when am i having my meals is there a big gap i want you to become sherlock holmes look at your eating pattern don't look at what you're eating at the moment look at when you're eating is there a gap of more than two hours well of course there is scott i have my lunch at one o'clock and i don't eat even a meal to seven o'clock you telling me you go six hours without eating think about that is that smart what's happening to your fuel stores during that six hours now as you train you increase lean muscle if you're really smart about it you're doing lean muscle exercises every single day lean muscle is going to allow you to do what store more glycogen yes build the stores up because i've just told you that glycogen stored in the muscle and the liver but most of it in the muscle four grams in the blood a banana is 20 grams so you're getting like a quarter of it stored in the blood okay but people will continue to saturate the blood but not use it but we'll come on to that right so but think okay those gaps in your meals okay is it sensible no is it breaking away from traditional thinking for you hell yeah of course it is because that's that's not what we do with the family always eat at this time when we cook and we do this and we do that i want you thinking about if you could eat six times a day eight times a day right i'll leave that with you okay right welcome andrew i saw that pop up there new subscriber did you like that fancy little graphic yeah that was quite clever wasn't it not too sure uh how that did that can you see how i've hold on i've kicked my camera there and it's gone off there can i move that back let me uh yeah i don't know what i did there kicked my camera right let me look now at looking at how we're going to replace so let me talk a little bit about uh where we're going to get these replacements so what's going to happen how best should i replace my carb stores so thinking about uh the the timing so let's say a couple of things so your long ride this is a ride that's going to go over two hours i talk about 90 minutes for older athletes in my category say over 50. 90 minutes if we start to go for two hours you are going to deplete now here's the rate of depletion if the ride is on average more than eighty percent of ftp okay eighty percent of ftp are above which let's face it for a lot of people is not that much they'll go out in a group ride with some friends and they'll just ride like idiots okay as we say in the trade they'll be measuring each other's wellies without pulling the shots down okay load of nonsense it's not productive to a really structured train plan it's okay now and then if it's under the the 80 then fueling takes place quite naturally right you'll get your 60 to 80 grams in the first hour afterwards and then you'll have the next 24 hours believe it or not to fill up those stores now if the ride is much harder and it's say over the two hours as well you will need to increase quite dramatically now in elite terms we would go all the way to 8 to 10 grams 8 to 10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight over the next 12 hours wow it's quite a lot it is a lot because you've got so much to replace if i've got stores of 2336 i've got to get that back in plus my bmr plus i'll be running what's called epoch burning at a higher temperature can you see how easy it is even when you think you're quite disciplined to fall under and then suddenly three days five days a week later you just got this almighty fatigue because you're not quite getting the carbohydrates and you're starting to use proteins for fuel you're exercising far too hard at the moment to use fat for fuel okay it's just not going to happen and there are too many other stores of of glycogen and protein available for you to get into getting to fat okay so the conundrum is scott how am i going to lose weight okay how am i going to manage to lose weight well the thing is you're burning so many calories way more than your app is actually telling you that you will gradually as long as we clean up our diet so let's follow a nice structure use the template i've given you there from how i run my week when is breakfast i try and keep it as consistent a time of day with almost to the minute okay i know that sounds a little bit anal but almost to the minute and it's as quick as i get up i don't get up and wander around and allow my body to start activating and get used to not having you because as soon as it goes there people that's a bad place to get to because therefore when carbohydrates do come in okay it will burn them but it will be holding on to fat more and you are very unlikely to get rid of that fat if you're falling into that trap so when people who are overweight tell me oh i try everything to lose weight but i'm still holding on to all this fat they've got the most ludicrous eating pattern whereby they're starving themselves and then gorging so we'll come to that because that's really important for an athlete that we avoid that at all costs i've already told you think of the two hours okay think what have you had to eat in the last two hours or two hours going forward okay so you finish your ride we normally fall into the 1 to 1.2 1.3 grams okay if you just stick with say 60 to 80 grams now you need the you need the protein so take your protein shake you're going to get 20 grams get that dealt with in the first 20 30 minutes take an hour make sure you get that 60 to 80 grams of carbohydrate but if your ride has been over two hours you must have fueled on the bike because if you do doing even if you think well i'm only two hours scott it's not too bad remember you've depleted the existing stores so when you come off and you have your little bit you're nowhere near getting back to the level of storage you need what does this do it has a hormonal effect on you it will make you more hungry to eat rubbish you'll find yourself constantly snacking because you've not really satisfied the missing calories that the training has taken out if you want to progress you've got to get into good habits so that might mean that all you would need is say 40 to 60 grams for a two hour ride if you can't work that out just take a a sports liquid i would always say a liquid ahead of a bar because a lot of bars they are full of fats okay and a lot of gels have got crazy suspension uh solutions so they may be quite acidic so you've got to experiment you can make your own things from oats and dried fruit and honey and natural products okay and you can have a fair idea from the components that you make it with what the percentage is okay start to experiment with that now what about when you start to replace them you may become fearful have i eaten too many have i eaten too much well we can have a a pro athlete try to absorb 8 grams to 10 grams per kilogram over the next few hours remember you can only oxidize one gram per minute of carbohydrate okay so if we go over that we will store them but if you're training again the following day it's better to have excess levels because you are going to use them up now if you do have excess levels you will feel it okay you feel a little bit bloated you may feel that your your water retentions much so again that gives you an idea here i took too much but i'm going to now use it because what if i was to say to you this what if the antidote was training time so if i said i want you eating every two hours i want you having a carb source as your main fuel but you're going to train more wow can i do that can i train more because that's the antidote because the trouble with modern society is carbs make the most of their diet especially through processed foods but the one to four hour time scale for it to be stored used is missed so it's stored and not used so it's continually topped up so a very unfit overweight person yeah it's going to have high stores of glycogen but they haven't got the casio cardiovascular system to go out and burn all that off so they fall into this trap becomes very difficult by not exercising they lose lean tissue so they're stores of how they actually store glycogen is gone so they're suitcases to go in holiday they become tiny they can't take anything with them they can't take glycogen if you improve your lean tissue you improve your suitcase size that'll let you fill up one suitcase full of money yeah full of money that's great and it doesn't matter you don't have to have bulking muscles not like me you know you don't have to be built like me or arnold schwarzenegger or that but you're going to be able to store more fuel and it's regardless of what age you are don't be telling me i'm 50 i'm sexy i can't put muscle on it's harder but you can't do it you discipline yourself to 10 15 minutes a day exercises i'm not talking about going to the gym i'm talking about isometric body resistance exercises it can be done okay so i'm aware that i'm rushing through things quite a lot here let me go to uh i was going to look at the antidote let me let me try and summarize uh i was going to talk about top foods yeah so remember i showed this before i've talked about here so in this list of foods that this would be one this helps me cleanse this keeps inflammation down for my ulcerative colitis so these are great foods and green are the top top foods so something like you know i can see they are you know turmeric amazing uh broccoli blueberries cranberries pineapples chips all these foods they will really help me cleanse and keep the diet low in inflammation because the training is causing the inflammation so what i want you thinking about is look at what you're having for breakfast now you can have the same thing every day look at what you're having for your lunch where are the carbs where are the proteins but where are you getting those simple carbs and can you load up on carbs going into training and can you tidy up in that first 20 minutes to hour afterwards and get the stores back in now here's the big game changer can you eat six to eight times a week could you try it for a week and see if it helps but you've got to make one big change people you've got to make the most drastic change but especially in the uk i see people cannot make and that is to reduce your portion size almost by half to eat less why because i've told you the body will oxidize one gram per minute so if you look at your plate and it's got over the volume of carbohydrates really needed you're going to find it harder to break them down and store them in that one sitting it can cause you stomach upset if we eat too much now you may be in a position whereby you already know that but you don't change your habits so to increase the volume of food in calories we must decrease portion size and this is it's not rocket science uh but it's so difficult for people to do if you look at the two-hour rule so if i said to someone oh yeah i had my lunch scott at one o'clock and i didn't eat against seven o'clock that's because they've been eating snacks they've been dipping into a chocolate here or there because hormonally their body's all over the place because it can't go that long glycogen is beginning to deplete and the body's saying hey we're in that crazy little position again so let's start to store the fat and let's use anything else and suddenly proteins getting used and you're in such catabolic phase from the training that your proteins are re-synthesizing all the time so you've got to take in the amino acids because you're not producing them naturally but you're messing with that because you're not eating properly so that's the biggest change smaller portions more often and by doing that you clean up your metabolic rate you'll actually burn more calories and you'll be able to eat foods that you quite enjoy so it's i know it sounds crazy so what you've got to do is one what are your metrics today what's your weight what's your fat percentage what's your muscle percentage and what's your present hydration level yeah you may have to spend a little bit of money on a set of scales get yourself an app that may measure it for you okay something that allows you because if you're serious about it you'll make that investment i'm not talking about a lot but you'll get those metrics and you'll start to understand how to tweak them your scales if they can take those measurements they'll give you a basal metabolic rate your daily intake you'll be able to then create a bmi then you start to look at your food intake and you start to understand well i need to make sure if i'm on the same as scott i'm 500 muscle um 80 and leather and 4 in blood so let's work that out here you know let's work out the calories i'm going to have available because if you get it right and you lead into your key session correctly fueled you will explode you will push the numbers that you never thought possible okay never thought possible so what's this two hour rule scott that you mentioned as well the two-hour rule obviously i've talked about two hours between meals i've talked about two others of stored fuel okay now if you're going out you're gonna go over the two hours you would start fueling again about an hour you would use what you've had for breakfast or the last meal that would take you through the first hour and then you start if you're gonna go over now there's two hours pre-training now the two hours pre-training some coaches will talk about three hours for solid food i like to go to two hours but two hours okay we would start to introduce liquids you would try and avoid anything solid look at the texture of the food and think about its digestibility think about how it's going to be digested and you would try and avoid that so you try and keep now i've talked about this today with a few athletes if you look now at a lot of modern sport and we look especially soccer football we see it in the uk and we see across europe when a substitute is about to come on you will see many of them and i've seen in the uk and the english premiership a lot of them taking an sis jail the very second they put themself on the pitch take it throw it away now we used to always ask the athlete to put the gels up the shots to keep them warm and take now the trouble with taking a gel if you get it wrong is the timing if you take it too far out from the explosion of the exercise you'll have an insulin spike and dip they'll take it going on to the pitch why because they're about to explode into anaerobic aerobic exercise so it can work they can give you that extra little top up of the battery so it's like having your phone at 95 percent but i'm going to go better at 100 boom we do it you can maybe start to experiment with that on your key workouts that you would have that say we do the warm-up and then just a couple of minutes before take it boom off you go on a hard workout maybe you're doing an hour session and you've got to 45 minutes and you always tend to flag i would have it then as well so start to do things that completely are different for you whereby you're feeling during some of your shorter but harder when we're doing ftp plus efforts when you know fuel is burning like throwing paper on a fire okay so again you start to do that so that's that two hours before there's the two hour ride then there's the two hours after so what happens when you're you've done your long ride you've followed protein you've had 20 grams within the first 20 minutes scott you've you've then done 80 grams of carbs in that first hour and then later on there you start to feel fatigued heavy-legged etc remember your fitness level will have an effect as well but you've got to then introduce the grazing constantly grazing what you're going to graze on can you graze on vegetables and salads to get carbohydrates of course you can so think about where you're getting your carbohydrates because when i say about cleansing your diet most people don't need to make too many changes to the diet they just need to cut out some of the  okay and like it's not rocket science you just look on your cupboards and think about the things you go to when you're hungry because you're thinking oh that'll put me off i'm going to have my my evening meal soon why if you're hungry you need to eat because if you're training and you're falling hungry and you're there for below the 50 stored fuel you're not training you're just burning more energy because you can't train because you can't hit the high numbers it sounds easy doesn't it for a lot of people it's very difficult it's very difficult to get their head around consuming more to lose weight consume more you'll burn more and you'll start creating more lean tissue and as soon as you tip that metric scale in the favor of lean tissue you're on a winning roll suddenly lean tissue goes up volume of stores carbohydrate goes up your absorption rate goes up so you can store even more you'll burn even more at a faster rate and suddenly you'll be able to maintain a healthy weight because most people if they go on a scale that measures metrics will have fat higher than muscle okay that's not a good place to be in okay so you start to look at that number you start to play around with that and you start to play so i'm not saying lose weight change body shape but put on more muscle okay and we're not asking about big bulky muscle we're talking about fiber recruitment i could talk all night about it folks okay it's so so simple to make it complex let me go through again metrics look at your metrics then look at your weekly routine when's your breakfast do you need to take extra how are you fueling two hours out from a session how are you feeling during a session and then how are you feeling 20 minutes and two hours after the session okay is there a feeling of depletion in the legs heavy legs fatigue levels for sleeping irritability if you're falling into that there's a fueling issue and where are you getting your carbohydrates from okay think about the foods that showed up you can go back through this podcast and rerun them okay i forgot to put my little light on behind me i've got lots of shadows it doesn't matter does it but think about where you're getting them from okay and can you clean that up there's so many things to do almost like there's a year's worth of work there honestly there's not much because you would just do one thing at a time i think for most people getting their metrics a starting point what percentage of fat what percentage of muscle have i got let's take it now ground zero let's start today where's that at okay now i saw some things mission fly up there about intermittent fasting so uh fasting has there's been a lot of research on fasting i'm not a fan of it folks so it's not something that like i say if you want to lose weight and use cycling as your means of exercise don't train just cycle keep it 80 below ftp and then burn your calories that you need to bond and then replace with really sensible fuel but still follow the two-hour rule but if you want to train while fasting yeah what you're trying to gain from it that you can actually then utilize fat for energy i want you to think about that i've told you that it takes four times as much oxygen for one gram of fat to be utilized into oxygen than it does for carbohydrate seriously you want to use four times as much oxygen oxygen is gold it's diamonds it's it's currency so why would you then expend four times as much how many calories are we going to get in fat have you worked it out yet you get double don't you you get eight well the four for from so okay scott well if i get double but it's taking four times as much oxygen so it's much harder why would you want to do a cycling event okay now if you're out to to be let's say odax or cycle 100 miles very very slowly yes i would have a small argument for being able to utilize fat but very rarely because in cycling it's about speed like you expect getting from a to b as quick as you can and you're going to be going far too quick at 80 85 90 revolutions per minute to use fat so yes intermittent fasting or any program like that if you want to lose weight but do not train just exercise there is a difference people okay so just follow an exercise program uh let me go through uh any other questions can i just scroll back folks everybody talking about their case rice cakes as many people put that rice cakes you can get the most exquisite rice cakes now you can even make them so you can make a rice cake peanut butter in it and a bit of honey it's fantastic experiment with a fuel and foods foods that you like okay uh another quite popular advocates never dieting while on a bike if anything over fuel well riding like whoa that's exactly uh i think i'm just of said that we exercise to get fit and we cleanse our diet to to try and lose weight we don't exercise to increase calorie bond in order to lose weight okay we don't train it's impossible to train i want you to just think of that in basic primary junior school science chemical reaction is oxygen glycogen energy okay internal respiration or external respiration even in plants that's it you want to mess around with that and create anaerobic exercise well what have you got you've got five seconds of fuel it's not gonna take you very far okay without glycogen without oxygen five seconds yeah okay i could be rude then says something else but i won't porridge half full cup of dry uncooked yes we're about that we're on the same wavelength there peter but anyway let me go back through that uh if that helped uh i don't know if it did but that's that kind of idea so you can go back through the chat and you can look at that and you can see you can see if that helps that idea so you can see what i'm doing now that's rough okay that's just a rough idea of the schedule okay it's oh it's it gives me a pattern but what happens is i've done it for long enough that it's kind of inducted into my brain so let's say you get to tuesday tomorrow we'll be doing the live show for members yes we'll be kicking on at seven i'll jump on the bike about half past six so that gives me a window from half past four nothing solid so that means that lunch will be there'll be breakfast there'll be a second breakfast lunch i can have lunch mainly people 11 o'clock to half past 11. yeah and then i'll have another meal sort of mid-afternoon and then depending because there'll be no evening meal tomorrow there'll be a lunch there'll be another meal run about four o'clock and then i'll do the protein shake and something soft afterwards it's a mindset it's a shift to traditional ways of of eating but if you have smaller amounts more often i promise you you'll not only train better but you'll feel better hey look i'll put the light on oh scott is so good yeah it's so professional yeah but i forget everything right anyway how was that give me some feedback folks uh what do you want uh i want to create easy shareable information that we can put in little packages and share it out so that you've got the idea how would we build lean muscle well we're talking about you're going to build it on the bike the legs will start to increase muscle but you've got to get into a program i'm going to i'm going to share a program of squats and press-ups using your own body weight really really simple but if you stick to it let's give it i might do one of those 30-day challenges and get people to sign up and we'll do it for 30 days uh i'm going to be doing some workouts again for team members we're going to have one on thursday uh thursday evening i ran a bit before i do my workout just a short one about 10-15 minutes i'll pop it on the on the video and we're going to do a simple little body resistance posture for bike fitting a couple of exercises okay we'll do that so i'll put a little chat out on that and members can see that so it's fairly straightforward uh for weight loss more insulin resistance etc insulin resistance yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm definitely guilty of eating too much too close to a ride yeah you if you can get into the habit of testing yourself just try it once do it in an indoor session alan so you don't you know you're not going to go too far something that i notice if i've got it wrong is my blood pressure will drop and you'll feel that you just feel a little bit sickly a little bit uh lightheaded you're just not motivated for it you know immediately to fix that a lot of people are very easy to digest liquid carbohydrates that we can add to water okay so they can be very very useful to get to get used but i would rather someone whose training is over carbs because you are going to burn so many and then you monitor your metrics okay you if you feel as if you are put on weight you just need to train more so if i said the antidote is training time okay i didn't say about the intensity just time you can train more and you will feel like it okay you will feel like it and then if we get into training of course a rider must have a a lower and an upper end you know training's not all the same intensity that's just ridiculous the body doesn't work all the energy systems don't work that way so that has to be but if you can avoid uh dieting and training it just doesn't work impossible i would go over all the time let me see what we got okay so if you're doing a longer ride plus two hours do you begin eating say banana after about 30 minutes yeah 30 to 60 minutes yep and you might take that banana at 30 minutes nikki but you may be maybe broken into three so it's 25 grams would last so you don't have it all in one go yeah you get one gram per minute but remember it's about 25 grams so try and have it in sections so you just take a bite in the pocket 15 minutes take another bite on the other take another and you just keep ticking along it's very easy to forget most riders oh forgot to do it put a sticker on your bike or something or put some notification just tell yourself right and you if you've got say a bar you've made break it up into pieces that you'll be able to get into your mouth one mouthful that's it and just chew this is a lot easier to do than people make out it just takes planning it's not about running out the door can't find your your helmet suddenly you're out you've only got oh i've only brought one bottle i needed two i forgot my all buy something at the shop well what you're normally going to buy is something say like a uh a snickers bar or a mars bar this is not the best it's going to be okay but it's got a lot more fat in it than what you need okay and that's just going to upset your your diet in terms of your nutrition plan okay uh yeah or send scott you mentioned tips for getting rid of carb bloating oh yeah sorry that's a very good peter yeah so okay so you notice on monday when i say switch off the carbs so what we we can do is one key thing to remove any excess fluid that you're holding is go down to zone one and then you would spin high cadence zone one keep the heart rate really really low but keep it around about 45 to 55 never any more than 60 ftp and at that low intensity physiologically you're not going to put too much damage into the system in terms of building fitness but what you will do is you will get into the lymphatic system and that's where it's stored okay peter it's in the lymph so anything that's going to help us with the lymphatic system so even if you watch crappy tv you'll see a lot of massaging to try and ease out the lymphatic system so having one of those sort of a mot massage as well you know maybe you wouldn't lock down finishes you have a sports massage you may have you can see i've got my ferrogun okay this is really good for shaking up the system and helping flush the way i use it but zone one basic recovery and it's i mean it's 45 50 55 ftp if you go on my strava and you see anything recently i've been sharing them with some people and they're called spinney or reading they're so low that you can read so i'll go on and i'll read text or i'll read the research paper sent to me and i'll do that and this helps with the excess carbs i'll always have excess carbs because they're easier for me to digest and i'll flush them out that way and you'll feel it yourself once that fluid goes but keep an eye on your metrics peter keep an eye on that fluid if you're able to do it okay and that gives you an idea because when people shout yeah i lost half a stone did they you know it's mainly just that excess fluid because now i would love to do a session on carb loading for those of you who are leading into say longer events or longer training sessions or maybe we're going to do many training camps i'm doing one next week or i'm putting a number of riders through a mini training camp can go abroad so we'll manipulate a three day into four day overload okay whereby we'll really bomb four hours five hours per day so this can be this can be helped with a carb loading plan whereby we'll deplete carbs add more and so on and it can really really help uh yeah my zone one yeah zone one as we know physiologically it's not gonna have a massive effect on capillary density but even in zone one it's so low that glycogen will hang about and go hey i'm not really needed that much you're breathing in so much oxygen at this low level that you can't actually use fat this works if you're super fit so the fitter you get it's a bonus isn't it you get all these perks you'll burn fat in zone one okay an unfit person won't necessarily why because they've got others floating about uh glycogen they'll probably get out of breath much quicker but as fitness increases but they keep it soft the trouble is as fitness increases what do people normally do they go faster all the time so they miss out in these wonderfuls it's interesting how a pro trains like a pro and an amateur tries to train like a pro but ends up worse because they just don't have the the mindset to go slow to go fast to go faster everything's got to be done okay right got that aubrey nice for you to be on failing to plan yeah planning to fail says you know as we always say piss poor planning piss poor performance yeah you're going to control some variables my my goal for you is not to over complicate it don't count calories as much as you think you need to just look at your diet look at when you're having your meals and cut out the crap anything that's in a cardboard box is processed anything you're getting from a takeaway shop is processed can you cut them out for 28 days can you go home 28 days and say right no treats from the takeaway and i mean everybody in the house let's let's have a go let's see if we can do it we'll make our own treats here and then let's look at things that i know are not adding clean carbohydrates let's look at crisps okay those potato chips snacks can we go a month without them just cut them out by doing one thing like that amazing now i'm not saying go and and then throw out all the wine bottles all the gin and all the you know that's entirely up to you but what you've got to understand is if you're really desperate to make the gains and you've tuned in to listen to me ran on there's something in you that's warrior-like so you're really looking to make those gains okay right what do you think about high carb versus low fat versus high fat versus low carb like keto uh pesh sorry i think it's great if you want to lose weight but don't exercise on it do not exercise on low sugar or no sugar as i've just said if you miss carbs it's you're going to not only uh can i show you evidence about key mineral uh depletion on on keto diets that affect even information processing can you imagine that somebody say to you if you follow that diet you may actually interfere with your information process and decision making it will make you you know like let's not go there sure you're going to lose weight you lose a ton of weight but remember weight stays off how if we change body composition and increase muscle tissue people who fluctuate in weight who lose mass lose a consistent volume of muscle and fat at the same level without reversing that and putting on lean muscle you'll be in the same trap you'll just put the weight back on okay i know that sounds harsh but you've got to do the exercise and get build up the resistance so in terms of me as a sports scientist and as a coach i cannot advocate removing carbohydrates from your diet removing sugar okay i can't do that because carbohydrates are few and if you look at the sensible ones people tend to think of them as sweets and and what is high sugar does anyone know what what what deems something low sugar in both food and drink it's a very simple number to follow okay it's 5 grams per 100 grams if it's under or on five grams it's deemed as low sugar and if it's uh five is same millimeters milliliters for liquid okay five grams per hundred so next time you look at some of your foods look at how they split the sugars up as well if it's if it's if it saves more sugar it should be under five okay but eh it's not gonna help you fuel do not pick up an energy gel and look for it to be under five grams most of them are going to have 20 grams of carbohydrate in them okay uh liked it liked it nikki thanks very much okay folks so can i just recap on the membership you're not going to be able to join if you're ios on a phone follow the link to a laptop etc if you want more information just email me my email is kinetic 365 coaching at gmail.com it's in the about section in the uh youtube channel okay you just go to the about section if you go on the phone and you scroll across the top you will see membership but it doesn't allow you for some reason on ios to join you have to go into laptop okay but anyway that will start to grow and that's where i'm going to build out the community okay folks please give me a thumbs up uh and if you like the chat if you've got any questions please send them through i will go through all the chat uh sep i've just seen that did i miss that i start to eat after 30 to 45 minutes two bars an hour 40 to 50 grams carbs yeah so we've gone through that was that answering uh to nicki's question yeah if you know that you're going to be out for three four hours you make sure and remember your cool down period when you start say it's 10 or 20 minutes it's the start of the next session so when i do the saturday hard session and i roll into the sunday session during the cooldown that's my 20 minutes when i'm off the bike i'm starting to replace then so there'll be a there'll be 60 grams uh normally started and finished by the time i've i've washed or dried down the bike in that period okay and that starts to help thanks very much folks thanks john okay folks uh i'm going to sign off on that i hope that was beneficial i'm going to come back to this we're going to do a little bit more work on it and i'm going to talk about carb loading and how that can help but please send me through your questions you know stick with the channel as we grow i want more and more questions i want to interact with you more in the membership uh we'll do something a little bit deeper and i'll share some more info in terms of giving you handouts and such and clickable links etc like we had on that those those foods are shared okay and a big deep breath what are you going to go and eat now make sure you stay fueled okay right folks remember you stay safe keep spinning keep smiling and i'll see you soon", "YWArbRvaVag": "[Music] well hello and welcome my name is danny parker at least i think that's how it's pronounced um i am so glad to be here i mean this genuinely makes me so happy this is what brings me the most joy in my life is being in front of people and and talking and hopefully you know helping improve other people's lives and to make their journey as enjoyable as as my journey is for me so yeah you're you are literally helping me fulfill my destiny by being here today today we're going to talk about our bodies and how uh how we can become the best version of ourselves because we have a really healthy happy person that's inside of us and all we have to do is just do the right things and it and it will come out it will slowly replace replace the the crappy old version that we have that we're walking around with all the time and i am going to throw some ideas out to you today that are going to be kind of hard for you to wrap your brain around and i need you to be open-minded because i really want you to forget pretty much anything that you've learned anything that you know about food and nutrition because it's all going to just go out the window so do we have any questions so far if you rather than raise your hands i mean i just want you to put your fist on top of your head so if anybody has you know instead of raising your hands so anybody have any questions no okay cool just do that about 20 years ago i was pretty unfit i was uh very overweight didn't feel very well wasn't doing very well and but i just you know i just thought oh you know it'll i'll take care of it it'll you know whatever and was like that for a while and so just finally just said i have to lose weight i i was getting married and i didn't want to be you know unhealthy and so i really set off on a journey to basically at that time was just to lose weight and so i did you know what everybody does it just counted calories and was able to do really well but i just didn't feel well i just always felt tired and weak and so even though i had lost a bunch of weight i got to the point where and and i had been my gauge for how fit that i felt was mowing my mowing my grass because i had been mowing mowing my grass for years and years and years and i had lost this weight and now i couldn't even mow my grass self-propelled mower out there for an hour and i would just be done and i just be like oh what is going on so i pretty much at that point just decided that well i'm just not going to be able to to do it anymore and so i hired it out i was hiring guys to to mow my grass and uh so you know some more time passed and i you know still didn't feel very well i looked pretty good but i didn't feel very well um and it just it was just one of those things where it just kept wearing on me kept wearing on me and i had stiffness in the side of my neck and i had arthritis in these joints in my thumbs to where i got to the point to where i couldn't even pick up things um to where it affected how i would sleep or how how i would sit and so about six or seven years ago i just said this is it i i need i really need to find something that works um and so that's when i really really set off on my journey was was about six or seven years ago and it was just to to discover and to learn everything that i can about health because unless we're actively doing that we're we're going on old information we're unless we are actively seeking new latest knowledge we're going off old outdated information i mean that's why that's why if you have an accountant what that's why they go and take tax classes every year because things change things get updated things they they need to they need to stay fresh i mean it's just like anything else you need to you know we need to be educated on on the the latest and greatest stuff so speaking of being educated i'm not actually educated in this field other than the fact that i have just done all this research and it's been trial and error and i've and i've been just you know ravenous about finding the latest information and getting as many sources together as possible to see what overlaps and what's common and what is true and then and what is not you know and that was the most difficult part when i started on this was just there was just so much information and i had so much information that was left over in my head from things that i had you know learned my whole life and a lot of one of the worst sources of information about our health is the media so just don't don't believe what magazines and tv and and those things say unless you're getting it from other sources as well unless they're reinforcing something that you've already done research on so so i guess my whole point is that we we can achieve better health by making better choices about what we eat and it really comes down mostly to what it is that we eat and i realized that for some the limits the the choices are limited and that there are people that you're helping every day who don't have food at all i mean i understand that but the more we know and and the more the more we educate ourselves the better choices that we make and the more people we can help the human body has this amazing power to heal itself and all we have to do is uh is is just let it do that and by eating the right foods and doing the right things our body will heal itself much better much faster more efficiently and in in ways that we can't even imagine a lot of people think that and i used to think this too that our health or the level of our health or our fitness and those sorts of things are determined by uh by our genes because we're a lot like our parents and our kids are a lot like us and you know you we just think that that it's it's genetics and actually gen x is only like a really small percentage it's only like five or ten percent of who we are comes from our genetics so what happens is is that the genetics really come into that part of it really comes into being true is when we when our body starts to break down when we have disease so so because of the uh the genetic shortcomings that we get from our parents from our ancestors they manifest themselves the same way generations after generations so it's not it so it's mostly lifestyle that that is why kids are like their parents are like their parents and it's very very little to do with genetics so if you think of it this way and this this is how i how how i sort of sorted it out um if you look at like your facebook friends for example you have you have like these families that are your facebook friends that they're all just fit you know your first thought would be like oh well it's their genetics and all that sort of stuff it's mostly their lifestyle i mean normally you see you know a fit man and a fit woman get together it's because they have this similar lifestyle and they have kids and they're fit and so on and so on and then you have other families that are uh who are less active and have different routines and different traditions and those sorts of things and that's why they're they're the same so it has more to do with lifestyle than it does with genetics because yeah that's that was my thing for a long time i was just like well i'm just this way because my parents were this way you know i mean i'm just i'm just destined destined to be that way and just so you know that's just not true i guess the hardest thing for me to realize and the hardest thing for me to to describe along these lines is that we don't know how bad we feel right now because this is how we feel we've sort of acclimated to it this is just we are on our normal ground right now and for me it wasn't until i really really started seeing the benefits and i got the ball rolling and felt started feeling better and better and better that i realized how bad i felt 10 years ago 20 years ago when i was very unhealthy and very unfit because it happens slowly and you just think oh this you know this is just how i am so it's hard to it's hard to imagine but but right now we don't feel as good as we're capable of feeling i've sort of made a list of the things that are like the um the big bad three i call them and it's uh high blood sugar inflammation and a fatty liver okay so a little bit about high blood sugar uh high insulin is that the foods that we eat every time that we eat we spike insulin in in our bodies okay um and what happens is is our our our american diet is just full of carbohydrates and it's full of other things that are keeping our insulin level high all the time so we're just flooded with blood sugars but high blood sugar all the time and high blood sugar causes damage it causes us to gain weight uh just it's just nearly every single bad thing that happens in the human body is a result of high blood sugar people will talk about symptoms they'll say well these symptoms these these these those all basically come back to uh high blood sugar in our system and that that comes directly from our diet the other thing that we're all experiencing most of the time if not all the time is inflammation and when i first heard about this i'm just like inflammation what are you talking about because i would think of inflammation be like if you sprained your ankle or if you cut yourself and it would get red or whatever but the reality of it is is that because our our blood sugar level is so high we have inflammation everywhere in our body all the time right down to a cellular level so right now our cells are going ah enough sugar enough enough oh i just need to heal help me heal so if you can imagine every little cell in your body being all pink and red and you know going like oh this is terrible come on help me out and then the third thing is uh our liver and most of us have a fatty liver the easiest way to tell if if if a person or if i have a fatty liver is if i have if i have some belly around here that means i have a fatty liver because because our liver is right here and it puts any extra fat right next to it and most of us and a lot of people even though there are people who are thin who who have a bad uh poor diet they still can have a fatty liver even though they may not have much belly fat but it's and it's because the the liver gets full of loaded with that well you know i was just amazed the more i learned about our liver and how much it does because we always hear about our brain and our stomach and our heart you know and and all the packages in the store get heart healthy and heart happy and all that sort of stuff well there's a reason for that and it's because most of us are going to die from heart disease i mean that's how most people on the planet dot wind up dying is from some form of of heart disease so that's understandable why you know we want to take care of our heart but our liver is actually a like i think it's like the most important organ because it's the workhorse it filters out all the toxins the sugars it it puts the nutrition nutrients and the vitamins and all the good stuff that's in our food food it puts it where it needs to go sends it off in the right direction and our liver is this this nasty thing that filters out all the crap that we are exposed to the stuff that we eat the stuff that you know is exposed to our body it just filters out all of that stuff and our liver is so important and it's so robust that i've read that even if we only have like 20 percent it might even be less than that 24 of our liver is working properly because we've we've damaged it so much even if just 20 percent of our liver is working properly it's still doing its job it can still handle everything that it needs to do so so that's sort of like a built-in thing for us you know that we evolved this way that because our liver was going to deal with so much bad stuff that it was going to deteriorate over time that's that's it just knows it's going to have to do that but the better care that we take of our liver the better job the easier job that it has and the more the the healthier we will be because of it so you know those are those are the big three and and even though a fatty liver and inflammation comes from uh high insulin i think it's still important to sort of like you know point each each one of those out and those are all because of our diet so you know now you're probably asking yourself well what do i do you know what sort of diet are you talking about well i call it and i may have heard this somewhere i call it the proper human diet we've been looking for the magic pill we've been looking for the magic combination or the answer to what is the simple answer to you know correcting all these problems that we have the simple answer is we're not eating food that's meant for humans to eat the most readily available food isn't isn't human food so i wouldn't be surprised if if i were you at this point and you're just thinking oh well what do we do i think you know i go to the store i spend all this money on food it's delicious it's you know it has stuff in it that's good for me you know what what what are you talking about what what is this human diet well i've given you these lists some of the things in the on this list is is going to uh really kind of warp your brain because it goes against things that we've been told our whole lives our parents have been told it's it's and there's just a lot of misinformation out there i would just say as soon as possible start replacing the things on the not list with things that are on the do list but the most important part about all of this is reducing our intake of carbohydrates because they're killing us so just to go real quickly i'm going to hit some highlights here um and not go too long on this potatoes and corn they're just out i mean you got to start whittling those down those you don't even include those as on your list of vegetables because they're just so bad for you and they're in everything and they're everywhere they're just really high in starch and carbs and there are there are good substitutions you know i mean do your research go online find a substitution for uh for potatoes uh cauliflowers are real good and you can get a mashed cauliflower frozen mashed cauliflower and um anyway so just do your research on that uh the next one that's the biggest one that's the hardest one for me are the starches and the grain flowers so all that good stuff that we eat so much of that it's part of every single meal rice breads buns tortillas pastas you know all that stuff what's really awesome now is that there are some really good low net carb tortillas and low net carb bread and and if you if you're not familiar with what net carbs are i can show you here so so when you're looking at the nutritional label on a on a on a package and i really really can't stress enough how we need to be reading these labels because of the ingredients to figure a net carb you know all of these labels are are pretty much standardized and so to find out what the net carbs are in something or other you look for the total carbohydrates so in this example uh this and this is these are both bread one a single slice of bread so in this one a single slice of bread has 14 grams of carbohydrates but it has one gram of fiber we get to subtract the fiber from the carbs okay so this slice of bread has 13 grams of carbs which is one less but it has 11 grams of fiber so we get to subtract the fiber from the carbohydrates so this slice of bread only has two this one has 13 this one has two so if you eat two slices of bread here you've got some number that i can't figure where here it would just be two and two is four so that's how that's how you look for look for what the net carbs is and the net carb that's something that you're hearing more and more of and you will hear more about our net carbs it's one of those things like everything else the the the more we buy the more the demand is for and the price will will go down uh the alternative is is to just eat half as much bread or just carve out as much bread out of your diet as you possibly can okay the next on the list is sweets anything sweet i mean anything sweet and don't believe it when something says you know that it's sugar-free because uh there's there's a nasty little ingredient that's called maltodextrin it's here on the list if you look at this list of the glycemic index what this is is these are sweeteners artificial and otherwise and if you look at the column on the right the glycemic index that shows the impact that it has on our blood sugar so right up there at the very top and this is just how it is i didn't invent this list this is just how it is at the very top there is 110 is and and those numbers are just relative right to each other and then you have on the other on the other column at the bottom you have something like stevia that's a zero so if you're if you're going for a sweetener that isn't sugar you certainly want to have stevia rather than maltodextrin because malt detection is going to going to spike you to 110. and if you go down a little bit underneath maltodextrin go down a little bit you can see sucrose there is highlighted that's just table sugar that's only 65. so you have you have packaged sweeteners out there that say that they're zero calorie because maltodextrin doesn't necessarily have a lot of calories in it but it will spike your insulin worse than table sugar so there are these there there are people out there who are diabetic that are buying these uh sugar substitutes that say zero calorie and zero sugar and it's worse for them than if they had just eaten sugar so that's just to show you how bad maltodextrin is so when you're reading your labels and you're looking at things that are sweet and say no sugar or you know calorie free or whatever look at the list of labels and if it says maltodextrin in there just don't buy it you're better off buying the good old-fashioned stuff which you shouldn't be buying anyway um i know this lean and processed meats is going to sound weird because you know i mean it's cold cuts and you know you think they're low in fat and all that sort of stuff cold cuts and lean deli meats those are usually full of fillers and things that aren't good for you it's just not a quality protein and i'll explain this one later the low-fat dairy just don't buy low-fat dairy stuff i know this sounds crazy but you want full fat dairy if you're buying if you're buying meat or if you're buying dairy you want the full fat stuff our bodies our bodies are made of fat our bodies want fat our bodies need fat but we need the real fat that comes from real food that comes from that you know the best source is cows i mean cows are freaking awesome so oh this is a big one so so my two main things that i want to stress more than anything is reducing the carbohydrate intake but more than anything we have to stop using seed oils vegetable oils because because these are chemicals made in a chemical factory and they're poison they're they are literally poison so you know i mean there a lot of them are listed there and there are more than just these but don't get hung up on this i mean because you know i first thought of like you know the oil that you have in a container that you bake with and you cook with and you fry with and all that sort of stuff but soybean oil is one of the most used oils and it's in freaking everything so when you buy chips those are those are fried in soybean oil or another one of these seed oils or a combination when you buy salad dressings salad dressings the first ingredient on a list of ingredients is the most is the most ingredient used in that particular product you look at salad dressing the first thing is soybean oil so we we think oh i'm going to get fit i'm going to get healthy i'm going to start eating salads and you know you pour this salad dressing on there well most of them are loaded with sweeteners and a lot of them with maltodextrin but they're made the base is soybean oil so and speaking of cooking with these seed oils is there's a thing that happens on a molecular level when you heat these seed oils they become carcinogenic it's just it's it's like you might as well just be drinking cancer if you're heating or eating things that have been heated in these seed oils i i can't stress this enough i've said it enough there they are poison they're literally poison so you know you have like mayonnaise and miracle whip and margin and margarine and other things like that that are based in these these oils and just you'll as soon as you start reading your labels you'll just be like yeah there's soybean oil in everything we have to really really reduce the amount of fruit and fruit juices that we consume down to as close to zero as possible and i know i know what you're thinking you're thinking what i thought for years and years and years i'm getting vitamin c from this orange orange juice i'm getting vitamin c from this you know juice or whatever it is well aside from the fact that that fruits now have been have are are way more sweeter than they were in the past so if you were to eat an orange 100 years ago you would just go good and it tastes like an orange at all because because all the fruits are sweeter now because we like them more we're going to buy more of these they're better they're better the better because there's it's just because they've been made to be sweeter okay so so we're drinking this orange juice and we're just thinking oh this is full of vitamin c and you know fruity goodness and everything well that's fructose the sugar natural sugar you know natural sugar that's fructose it doesn't it doesn't matter i mean look at your other list fructose is on here and you're just sort of like well that's still it's it's low it's like a 25 but our body doesn't really care if it's natural sugar or if it's regular sugar as soon as we consume it and our body converts it over to sugar that's just that's just what it is and so what happens is the very little bit of nutritional value that is in fruit is completely canceled out by how much sugar that there there is in it you see what i'm saying so you're thinking you're doing it yourself good but there it's mostly bad and a little bit of good there and then the the reality of it is is that because of the sugar that's in there you're not even getting the new nutritional value at all it's it's pretty much zero and to make it even worse if you're drinking juice so any juice or most juices that are packaged that you buy in the store are pasteurized which means they're heated so even if there was any natural nutritional value left in there as soon as it's heated it's gone you might as well be drinking soda pop if you're drinking fruit juice and i know that's really really hard to fathom but that that is the actual truth of it all and it's it's the same for fruit for vegetable juices because i like tomato juice i really it's my whole life i love tomato juice and i also think oh i'm drinking v8 juice that's i don't have to eat vegetables i'm i'm i'm drinking v8 juice yeah look at all these vitamins that are in here well the vitamins that are in there they're very very small amounts and if you're thinking in terms of like vitamin c for example the vitamin c that is on the label of something and that you're drinking this for the vitamin c that's actually added back in those those things are fortified the the the vitamin c that is in things is made from corn starch it's it's made in a factory it's made in a chemical factory and it's added in that's not good vitamin c any vitamins that you could get from fruits you can get from vegetables soda pop just soda it's just out it's just out no matter what sort of sweetener or whatever is in that i i have found there is a soda that's actually really good that's called uh xevia i think that's made with um stevia and uh i mean i'm not really a soda drinker but if you need soda go with something like that beer wine mixed drinks they're just out reduce as much as possible get it get it down to as as few as as possible oh my gosh me and my friends used to go out and you know and get these giant giant margaritas and drink those and you know four or five hours later just be like oh my god i feel so terrible why did i drink that great big and i always thought it was it was the alcohol that was in it it's not it's the high fructose corn syrup that's in those things it's the sugar it's the it's the crashing of our lives happening in our brain because we just drank so much sugar you're actually better off and this was something that i discovered independent of this health thing is that we're actually better off just drinking straight uh straight liquor yeah seriously because because your our bodies can actually metabolize that alcohol uh easier than it can of all the other the other sugars that are that are in these are that are in beer and wine and stuff like that the downside is though is that if you do a couple of shots of vodka or gin or tequila or something like that your our liver has to has to metabolize that has to process that but what happens is is i can go out and i can eat a really really good low carb very healthy very satisfying meal and do you know some some vodka with that as soon as that gets into my liver my liver will always always process the sugar and the alcohol first and it may take a day or two for our body to process alcohol like that so all of that good food that i'm eating it's just sort of like it might as well have not even eat because the liver is just like going i'll get to that i'll get to that it's this this this our bodies our bodies don't like being full of sugar and so what our body tries to do is it tries to get rid of it fastest because it sees it as as a poison as as an as an invader our body runs much more efficiently and much happier if we're burning our own fat rather than burning the sugar that's in our blood because of all the crap that we ate but what happens is because our diets are so full of of foods that convert to sugar we have a high high sugar all the time and so our body's processing that that that and it's more than we need so the extra sugar it just stores it as fat where if we weren't consuming that high sugar diet it would start burning the fat but instead every time we eat we're just making more fat so if we stop eating the foods that are that are raising our blood sugar our bodies will naturally start burning its favorite fuel to burn which is our own fat that's what it's for it's there for our fuel don't buy anything oh my gosh don't buy anything that says uh fat-free low-fat light sugar-free low-cal keto and all that sort of stuff that's just marketing um yeah and the the the the big thing here while we're talking about food is just try to just buy real food don't buy food that comes in packages if you're buying food in packages make sure it's just the smallest part of what you're buying and um and yeah i had somebody point this out to me what's really really really cool when you go to the store spend most of your time on the edge around the edges probably have heard that before because when you go in there's the produce that's right there on that front edge and usually right behind the produce are the frozen you're much better off having frozen than you are having anything that comes in a tin because vegetables that are in a can again they have been uh pasteurized they've been heated and so you're getting very little nutritional value not getting as much nutritional value let's say as if you were eating fresh or frozen and then the you know the the protein the meat and the cheeses are on one side of the store and then the you know the dairy and the eggs and stuff like that or on another side of the store just mostly stay around the outside and then only go into the middle to get you know those uh extra things so i want you to take these take these lists and you know just sort of think about or even write down on these lists you know the questions that i've asked there is like what are the what things here are the hardest to avoid and what things are the easiest to avoid and you know like i'm always talking about is just start on the easy ones first the things that are on here that you're just like oh i don't have a problem with that because me i'm not i'm not a sweet person so i don't really have much problem with cutting out sweets uh for me it's chips and pasta and stuff like that that's where i where i had difficulty so start working on the stuff cutting out the stuff that's the easiest to do and then start working on the other ones that are the next easiest and all that sort of stuff but these are just ways to start moving in the right direction i mean if you had told me 10 years ago what my diet and my lifestyle would be would be now i would have i would just would have said there's just no way but i didn't go from ten years ago to today it's just been a long slow process it's been trial and error and uh there are definitely things in the first couple years that i did religiously that are just completely out now because i learned more as i went along and i also learned what worked for me we all have to find what works for us i mean it'd be real easy for for someone to say this is what you need to do you need i know it sounds like that i'm saying that what i'm saying is is just take this information in and use it to your advantage you can you can do it if i can do it i know anybody can do it oh my gosh am i i am just like really the laziest person i i really really am okay so we're going to go through the to-do list really fast because this is going to sound you know it's going to make a lot more sense but cruciferous vegetables i didn't know what that meant when i first read cruciferous vegetables i have to look it up and i still have to look up it doesn't matter what they're called if i can't say it it doesn't matter um you know broccoli cauliflower all that sort of stuff but as we go along in this list you'll find that you know it's what's really really cool is that you know if you make brussels sprouts and why would anybody but if you make brussels sprouts you can load those up with real live bacon and bacon grease and butter and other stuff that are on this list to just make them taste really really good yeah just think about that is it getting close to lunch time seriously my my mouth is watering i don't even like brussels sprouts anyway so you know go down to the list okay avocado i'm not sure if avocado is officially a vegetable but uh an avocado is a superfood so just keep that in mind as many avocados as you can eat i really do not like avocados but over time i've gotten into uh buying fresh guacamole that comes in the little things so avocado is a is a super food so you know if you can get get that into you know a little bit uh fatty meats i know this goes against everything that we've learned and we've been taught for decades that you shouldn't eat fatty meats those are the best food for you the quality of the protein is really high and because it has animal fat in it it will keep you satiated longer so the difference between the good fats the bad fats the the bad fats are the omega-6s those are the ones that are poisoned that are made in a factory and the good fats all come from a natural source and they're not produced in a factory well i guess you know they're butter is made in a in a dairy right think of it this way uh margarine is made out of chemicals in a chemical factory if you want to make butter you go milk a cow you put it in a churn and you go like this for a while and you got butter you can do it in a blender that's that's getting a natural fat from a natural source it's not coming out of a hose into a tank or truck at a factory i know this sounds crazy lard bacon grease beef tallow all of those cook in those don't cook in the stuff that is is the seed oil that that's the factory poison just switch over to this you will feel better you'll feel more satisfied with what you eat you'll be healthier you you will i promise you avocado oil is really good extra virgin olive oil is really good you can buy mayonnaise that is it still has blends of soybean oil and some of the other seed oils in it but at least it's mostly when you read the label the first ingredient is avocado oil or or olive oil the you can buy avocado and olive oil based mayonnaises but they're really really expensive but once again the price on that will go down the more that people you know stop buying the other ones um but the thing and i buy that but i don't eat very much of it because it tastes like house paint so there again you know if something just doesn't work for you you just you can't so so i go with the i go with the with the blend the avocado and olive oil blends in in mayonnaise rather than just saying well i can't do the perfect thing here so i'm just gonna do stick with the worst one there's that middle ground a lot of things there's a middle ground where you can find things you know that'll work coconut oil you know use that in stuff when you buy salad dressing there are salad dressings that are available that are based with olive oil or avocado oil again they're more expensive but make your own just use olive oil and apple cider vinegar for for your salad dressings the one of the very first things that i started doing on my journey was was doing an ounce of apple cider vinegar with the mother it's got to be the raw stuff with the mother's doing apple cider vinegar every single day because of our american diets because we're doing so much we're eating so much bad foods most of us don't have the the stomach acid that we should and the acid in our stomach is what is like the first line of breaking down breaking down foods to get the nutrients out that are bound up in the foods and so our stomachs need to be more acidic what you don't want to do is to drink apple cider vinegar straight because it'll strip all the nice white enamel off of your teeth permanently and it also is really it'll because it's acid it just really burns your throat and all that sort of stuff so what i recommend doing and what i started out doing is i would just get a glass of water like 12 or 16 ounces so a nice big glass of water or a bottle you know water bottle bottle water a water bottle a bottle of water um and just mix mix and ounce in with that so that's like two tablespoons or i just use a shot glass to do a real real shot not a shot um and uh so mix that in and just drink that throughout the day or have that uh drink half of it with with your with your meals i mean you know like for lunch and dinner because it'll actually do more good if you if you're drinking it with the food that you're eating um so even if i'm having a day where i've decided i'm not gonna do low carb let's say it's like around christmas time and i'm just like i'm gonna have candy and you know spaghetti and you know all this sort of stuff i still do apple cider vinegar every single day because because it doesn't matter what you're eating it's still going to help you process that food break down the nutrients that are in that food and it's just a good habit to get into and just i mean i'm gonna i'm going to do that forever i've been doing it for six seven years something like that i will i just will forever you're buying these great big jugs also things that you can do that don't necessarily hurt you but they don't they don't really even they don't help you it's it's coffee and tea as long as it's it's is unsweetened i do in the morning is i do four ounces of cold brew with a splash of heavy cream in it and no sweetener the the heavy cream in there doesn't spike your insulin but it satiates you so i go all the way to 11 12 1 o'clock before i have my first meal of the day that yeah you can make bulletproof coffee i mean it doesn't work in cold brew because it's just a lump of butter but yes it's the mother the mother if you look at if you look at apple cider vinegar if you look at vinegars you'll see that there's some that are just regular and then you have others that have the mother that means that it's that it's it's not been uh pasteurized and it has the the the junk in the bottom it has all the labels the label will say the mother because because this is really getting very popular now that more of them are available when i first started doing this there was one bottle on the shelf that i could find that had the mother in it and now there's like four or five so yeah that's the most important part if you're not getting it with the with the with the raw mother in it don't even bother so yeah so you do coffee and tea uh did you have a question other melissa about coffee or tea i thought maybe i saw you no oh you're just scratching your head i hate it when you do that if you want to have fruit you want to have a little bit of fruit these berries are okay in a small amount and the reason that chicken isn't on the list of either one of the the avoids or do is because it's it's a it's it's not a really quality source of protein i mean it's better than eating lunch meats or whatever but it can't be fried can't be breaded or fried in in the seed oils but chicken chicken is okay so again when you look at this list you know just look at the things that are the easiest and the most difficult and start working on the ones that you can to substitute uh the other ones but as far as the good fats the fatty meats and the vegetables if if you if you can replace the things on the bad list with these things you will start feeling better faster these are actually good for us it's real live human food how do we go about doing this well you know my favorite thing is small steps i call them nano steps and these then and i have my nano steps and all of you need to have your own nano steps that's why it should be on your list my nano steps so when you're going back and you're looking at those do's and don'ts on those lists before your nano steps are going to be okay what are my nano steps is i need to start buying i need to replace my seed oils with real live human food oils i need to so start making start making our nano list steps and one of the big things was is like i said is we are eating too many carbohydrates and i know that it sounds like a fad you know oh it's just a fad i don't i don't care if it's trendy or not we're not meant to be eating as many carbohydrates as we are that's that that alone is what is the is the simple answer to why we're all in such poor health is carbohydrates that's that's it and eating carbohydrates literally makes us hungry and i'm i'm going to show you i'm going to show you what that means think in terms of going through uh our day so you know here's when we get up and here's when when we go to bed and then this is the timeline of the day as it goes along all right so our normal blood sugar is is going to be at is going to be at a certain level so our normal blood sugar it's going to be going up and down like this throughout the day because of what we eat or how we exercise and different things like that our normal blood sugar is going to be like that now because most of us are eating way too many carbohydrates our normal standing blood sugar is going to be like up here so as we go up this is this is higher blood sugar all right so what happens is we're already starting out at this elevated rate so what i mean by carbohydrates make you hungry and carbohydrates make you crave carbohydrates is because we eat a carbohydrate we have a nice sweet roll for breakfast or a donut or something or other and what does that do i mean we've all experienced this it spikes our insulin we have this boost of energy you know and it tastes really good and all that sort of stuff we have this big spike in our blood sugar well what goes up must come down so what happens is then it comes down it comes crashing down and when you get into this level here that is below what our standing normal blood sugar is this is the area where we get hungry so our body goes oh my gosh all that energy is gone now i need i need food you you're tired i mean you know how that feels so you eat something else and it goes up again this is uh this is a burger and french fries for lunch all those carbs it goes up again and it crashes down again that's the two o'clock thing where it's like oh man i'm not going to make it through this afternoon it's because your blood sugar is down below what your what even what you're used to which is already too high so you're down into the hunger range again so you have a little snack and then you have your dinner you see what i mean so every time we eat this stuff and even if we're eating the things that are on the do list okay so that may raise a little bit so like for example the the good fats and the fatty meats that i was talking about that all that does is give you this little slow little peak and but it goes longer it keeps you satiated longer you're more satisfied when you have fatty meats and you have the the good oils on there it's not this instant point you have a little bit of a spike and it goes for a long time so the idea overall idea is to eat foods so that your blood sugars are doing this it's just these nice even waves you don't get hungry you're not hungry all the time you're not thinking about food all the time it freaking works i'm telling you it's it's amazing and there are there are some real advanced things that can be done that i do and that i'm working on you know all the time in order to make this happen so that's why when i say carbs make you hungry carbs make you crave more carbs that is that is literally what is happening in your body is the more of that stuff that we eat the more that stuff we want um and i know you know what i'm talking about people always used to say oh you know after thanksgiving dinner oh it feels so logy after thanksgiving dinner well it's because of the tryptophan that's in the turkey there's like the teeny teeny tiniest amount of tryptophan in the turkey it's because of the stuffing and because of the potatoes and because of of the the pie and the cranberry dressing it's all of those sugars that are in thanksgiving dinner that you normally don't have all in a big lump like that you know in the short little period that this paper doesn't go high enough to show what the spike from thanksgiving dinner is you know so that's that's what that's what that is all about and by having this high level of sugar like that uh that's that is also a huge uh factor in brain fog why why why can't i concentrate well you know it's because you you haven't eaten for two hours and what you did eat two hours ago is already gone there's no you don't have any energy from that left in you where if you're eating good human food you would so making these changes i know i know i know i know i know this is really really hard that's why that's why it's in the nano steps category i'm going to talk to you what i have called the sunday night syndrome okay thinking back about thanksgiving you all know what this is it's sunday night you've just had your dinner everything's you know the dishes are all put away everything's all put away you get your first chance to relax on sunday evening and you're like oh thinking about work tomorrow and you're just sort of like uh full i just had this logy weekend and i was like uh tomorrow i'm gonna go on my diet i'm going to uh exercise i'm going to you know i'm going to do this i'm going to do this you know that that's sunday night syndrome we have all done that i would like to know from some of you who have tried this how long does that last a week a couple of days a couple of hours on on monday morning that's me on monday morning i'm like i am going to oh i can't i'm just gonna you know it doesn't last and it just goes back to that thing of of humans like all living beings are not meant to change every thing about us wants to keep doing the same thing that we've been doing not because it's the best thing for us it's just because that's just what we've been doing so we want to make all of this change it's just it's too much it's just too much so so on your list on my nano list it's it's just pick pick one just pick one thing and and let's say it's just having one less soda pop on monday and if you can't do that then try half of one or if it's if it's like i'm going to go to the store and i'm going to buy um i'm going to i'm going to buy these healthy meats instead of these lunch meats do the things that you can take these nano steps write your own list of teeny tiny little steps and if if something doesn't work make the steps smaller but don't give up that's why that's why the sunday night syndrome is so bad as we make all of these plans and then they don't work and then we give up on all of it nano steps tiny tiny little nano steps one of the things that's really really working against all of us also and we need to work on this with our nano steps is stress and cortisol if you haven't heard of cortisol cortisol is the stress hormone we all have we all have cortisol our bodies are really good at manufacturing cortisol cortisol is think of it as our fight or flight reflex okay so the fight-or-flight reflex is in us and it's in you know a lot of a lot of animals it's it's so that we can run away when we see danger but cortisol is really only supposed to uh it's only supposed to to activate our adrenal glands for like less than a minute really i think it's something like 45 seconds that's long enough for us to run away from that tiger or to get out of the quicksand or whatever because nature has pretty much said well if you can't get out of that by 45 seconds then you're just dead you just deserve to die well the problem is is that because of our lifestyle because of because of news and because of our devices and because of our jobs and because of our relationships we are cranking out cortisol all the time we are all maxed out on cortisol our bodies are just going oh oh i'm late for oh i got to do the this is all so-and-so i mean seriously cortisol we're we're full of it and it's really really hard to get cortisol out of there and so the best the best method is to start whittling away at it nanosteps little by little by little reducing stress reduce stress reduce stress so you know one of the things that that one of the things that i do is i just i avoid the news and i avoid television i mean it's it's just stressful to watch tv just the nature of it alone because it's flashy and things are fast moving and all that sort of stuff i choose the tv shows and the movies that i watch because if you watch a movie where you know there's somebody in danger there are explosions and someone's trying to kill somebody and all that sort of stuff that raises your cortisol level so you watch a movie like that and then you go to bed forget it our cortisol levels are are are so high that is another another one of the reasons why uh uh why people can't sleep how people are having so much trouble sleeping is because is because their cortisol levels are really really high um so yeah just stop watching the news and because cortisol is a stress hormone uh it inhibits the manufacture of melatonin which is the sleep hormone so not only is is cortisol alone keeping us from sleeping it's keeping our bodies from manufacturing melatonin the way it naturally would so that we can sleep i mean it's just this double whammy of just bad bad bad and i don't recommend taking melatonin because uh you know like like cortisol melatonin is is a hormone that that our body makes to help us go to sleep our body will naturally manufacture that in the evening when it starts to get dark our body just goes oh it's getting dark so make make melatonin but if we start taking melatonin to help us sleep then our body goes oh well i already have there's there's melatonin here already i don't have to make melatonin so we're taking melatonin to help us sleep but then the melatonin that we're taking tells our body to stop making melatonin so it's just so you're just screwed and speaking of interrupting our sleep and this was one of the things again that that was a big one for me that when i learned this is how important sleep is because for sleep for for me was always one of those things where you don't really have to think about it or you don't have to you don't have to do sleep because you just lay down and it kind of does itself um well because sleep is uh so difficult for for most of us uh now um you know it's it's it's even more important because there are so many uh there are so many systems in our bodies that are repaired uh while we're sleeping uh so the way that so the way that sleep works so here again we're gonna on the chart we're gonna do you know from from the time that we fall asleep to the time that that we wake up okay so during that time there uh what what a normal uh human being does is we go through these so so this is this is being awake and down here is like deep sleep so what happens when when we sleep when we fall asleep we go down into deep sleep and then we come back up to a light sleep here is where we where we dream and usually when we wake up and we you know go have a pee or whatever it's because we're in this light sleep and then it goes down into a deep sleep and then back up to a light sleep and we go through this cycle these these cycles are are an hour and a half typically and sometimes they're more in the beginning or shorter in the you know it it just it just depends but it's in that range so basically you know in in an eight-hour normal sleep you have what would it be five of those so we're going through we're going through these cycles of sleep okay deep so this is one we're dreaming but when we're in deep sleep down in here is where our body does all this magical amazing repair so what happens with us with when we sleep lightly is we're never getting down into the repair we're never getting down into the repair stuff it's just sort of you know it's just sort of not really very deep sleep the deeper we go the more repair there is the longer we can maintain that deep sleep the more repair there is and so so what i recommend and i've i've done these things myself is um i bought curtains that are like the dark darkening room darkening curtains and in the window that faces the front where the street is i have two layers because they still weren't dark enough because what i what i realized was that there were cars that were pulling out of the street across the street and the headlights would flash well when i'm asleep i could be i could be in this deep sleep and be sleeping fine and the headlights would would flash well i wouldn't see them because they would just flash quickly but that would pull me out of that deep sleep uh it's the same thing with sound and i have a white noise machine it's the same thing with sound where maybe the dog barks the neighbor's dog barks for just a couple of minutes it may not be enough for you to wake up and just go stupid dog barking but it may be enough to keep you or to bring you out of that deep repair sleep so these are things that you that we can do that are just sort of like it's just sort of like having an ace up your sleeve i'm going to do everything that i can to try and get myself into that that best sleep possible another thing i know this is going to be really tough but is in their science behind this is the lower the temperature is when you sleep the better we will sleep um so you know if that means just having one less cover or whatever what i've been doing is just because of the way that my house works i just close the door and the room will just naturally be colder than if i if the door is open but just some way of getting that i mean i'm not saying change your thermostat every night or whatever maybe you can set it to do that or whatever i mean i'm not necessarily saying that but it really really works i i mean i know i sleep so much better when when when the room is cold but as far as this repair thing that i'm talking about just just think of it this way it's kind of like you know we drive our car during the day but at night we park it in the drive and and you know it just sits overnight well for us sleeping is the same way but just imagine if when our car was sat there overnight it was repairing itself if it was doing a diagnostic and it was going oh well i see that i need to tune this or i need to you know adjust that or whatever if the car did that all by itself that's part of the magic of our body our bodies do that all we have to do is just do all of these things in order to make sure that it's the highest likelihood that we're going to get deep sleep and our body will just do it and the better our diet is the more likely that it's going to be easier for our body to do that as well speaking of sleep let's talk about morning routine these are really really simple things to do and what's nice about them is like yo when you first wake up in the morning you don't want to do a whole lot it's like i'm just you know happy to be you know half asleep and all that sort of stuff so these things are fairly easy to do because you just do them in your head but they're really really powerful and they're they really really help so affirmations so affirmations for example is so when uh when when we first wake up in the morning if we say all right i am going to have an awesome day i feel strong i feel young i feel healthy i am happy i am just going to have an awesome day i'm going to have an awesome day i really really am going to enjoy this day i am fit and strong you know that a person who is thinking that when they first get up in the morning is going to have a way better day than someone who woke up going uh village crap and then when they go to bed they're like yeah i was right i did i felt like crap you know just affirmations they're easy even if you don't believe it if you say it and it becomes part of your regular routine your your your body will believe it because you're saying it and you start thinking it and it just becomes part of your subconscious and then visualizations too this one sounds kind of kooky but so like me for example when i there was when i was in my 20s i was pretty i felt pretty fit i mean i wasn't i wasn't as healthy as i as i could have been but i but i felt pretty good so when i first started going down this road i would imagine i would go back and i would imagine myself when i was in my 20s and and i would even even look at old photographs if we can remember how we felt when we felt really good at some point in our life and it could be even just be a couple of weeks ago if we remember how how it felt that time when we felt really really good and we think about how that feels and hold that with us while we're thinking i'm fit i'm strong i am strong our bodies will take that to mean that that's how i feel our body doesn't care if it's something that we're making up or if it's something that's real our body doesn't doesn't have a filter for that whatever we think our body just goes yeah yeah okay yeah i get it our body will will follow where our mind goes what we think is what we get it really really is true part of the morning routine is moderate exercise now if you're anything like me and i i really hope that you're not um i exercise just isn't something that has come easily for me and it never has um but the good the good news is is that most of the the transition into a healthier version of ourselves comes from our diet a very small amount of it has to come from exercise just because we we're alive and we're up and we're moving around and all that sort of stuff we don't we don't necessarily have to uh be doing like a big workout in order to make a big change the biggest change will come from uh changing our diet uh but what will really help and this goes back to the sleep thing too is that there are studies there are studies that have been done that have found that doing a little bit of moderate exercise first thing in the morning will actually help us sleep better at night and i know that sort of sort of sort of sounds the opposite of what you would think where you would just think well if i do a really big workout you know before i go to bed i'll be all tired because i'll i worked out and i'll sleep really well because you know well what happens is when we work out really hard we spike our cortisol manufacturer so our adrenal glands are going ah well because cortisol doesn't filter out of our system very easy if we exercise at night or in the evening it's going to it's going to keep us up because our body's all all stimulated so what they found is just and it can just be moderate exercise so um so what what really worked for me is just doing stretches i mean there's a website and they have a youtube channel that's called fitnessblender.com and you can go in there and you can they have dozens if not hundreds of different videos of workout routines and they're all the way from just doing simple little stretches all the way up to you know complete uh you know week-long routines uh you know and all that sort of stuff and you can go in and you just say well i'm looking for the simplest little thing that i can do because how many times have you heard have you heard people or um or even myself i mean i had a treadmill at one time well we'll go out and we'll spend 300 on this exercise equipment or we'll spend all this money to join the gym or whatever and it just it just it just goes to waste to me it's like well if i start doing stretches and i do that every morning or you're better off every other day because you have to you have to rest helps helps because down here when we're sleeping this is when we're this is when we're doing repair that's when when we're actually burning fat and we're doing repair to our body so you want to have you know some rest between your exercise um but uh what was i saying modern exercise in the morning and so what i do is uh so i'll just do a little bit of stretches so if you're doing stretches every other day and you're really into it you can add another short and stretch for five minutes it will help you sleep better it will help you feel better really really well it's not like the coach back in junior high school you gotta go go go you know if you're not doing all this stuff it's not working and you know you don't have to do that any little bit helps a little bit helps a lot um but yeah it just it doesn't it doesn't really do us any good to uh you know to do a big workout because um we can do most of that with food i say do do as much as as you want but it it absolutely cannot substitute for having a healthy diet there are people who are just like i'm gonna work on the gym i'm gonna do the marine training thing and all that sort of stuff and get fit and everything and if you're not changing your diet it's not gonna it's not gonna last it's it's what works for us and the better i feel the more i'm able to and the more i feel like doing physical activity we need to get some nature uh this is one of the things that kind of blew me away too is that there have been studies that done that were done that that if i am doing moderate exercise if i'm looking out a window at nature i actually get more benefit from that exercise if i'm just looking at nature if we actually do our moderate exercise outside in nature we get even more benefit from the exact same movement from the exact same amount of time that is spent our bodies get more benefit from it and that goes back to to our caveman days to to you know how we got here was because we uh we have survived this long because we were out chasing down our food in nature so our body goes oh yeah yeah this is it this is it this is what i'm supposed to be doing where if i'm just inside looking at a wall our body is just going all right i gotta get through this boo i mean it makes it easier but there's actually real benefit to getting out in nature so what i'm saying here is you know is that this is not some weird diet that i'm talking about it isn't some trendy thing it isn't some uh strange thing where i'm saying you need to eat all bacon or you only should eat uh green beans from a tin or you know anything like that what i'm saying is what we need to do is to eat a variety of real live whole foods real food and just stop eating all this manufactured crap so look at it this way i mean you know i like to make these fun analogies look at it this way okay so you know i have this little backyard you know i like to sit and look at the bunnies and the rabbits out in the backyard and one day i'm looking at the bunnies and the rabbits i'm like you know bunnies and rabbits they're kind of similar you know they're kind of they're small and they're furry and they're herbivores and they just hang around here all winter long and you know they're scurrying in the same around in the same areas and all that sort of stuff their mammals you know they're they're very similar but bunnies don't ever eat nuts or at least i don't ever see them you know scavenging for nuts the way squirrels do and squirrels don't ever eat dandelions so imagine if one day a dand imagine one day if a squirrel was like you know what this bunny seems to really like these dandelions i'm gonna give it a try well i know for a fact because i used to have a bunny if it had a indoor bunny his name was bunny bunnies just love freaking love dandelions you know and if you smell them they do have a really nice sort of sweet smell to them and and man if i would bring dandelions to the bunny it would it would just go crazy for the eat those over anything else right so obviously dandelions are good but squirrels don't eat dandelion so imagine if one day this a scroll goes you know i'm i fancy these dandelions i'm going to give this a try so it starts eating dandelions oh my gosh these are delicious and they're everywhere they grow like weeds i'm just going to keep eating dandelions as time goes by the the uh the squirrel starts you know putting on some weight and it starts having some digestive issues and it starts doesn't it doesn't feel very well and you know it's just like going man i i'm just not feeling well i freaking love these dandelions but i'm just not feeling well another squirrel comes along and says well here take this medication if you take this medication it'll make you feel better keep eating dandelions no what are we going to say to the squirrel we're going to say go back to eating squirrel food that will solve everything that is what is the problem with us human beings we're eating the dandelions and we need to go back to eating nuts so the takeaways are reduce carbohydrates when we reduce carbohydrates we will have more energy we can eliminate brain fog um our immune system will get stronger i'm i'm going to say one of those things that i what i heard people say this on in the beginning of my journey i just i just wanted to gag i don't get sick you you won't if you're if we are eating the right foods we won't have colds all the time we don't get sick all the time we just don't i heard a guy say that i was on a it was a you know like a blog or something like oh god he's one of these i don't get sick guys oh my gosh it is so true the amount of amount of illness that that we have goes way way way down when we reduce our carbohydrates uh eliminate those omega-6 and eliminate those bad fats even if you keep on a carbohydrate diet if you eliminate those bad fats you will feel better i promise you but part of it is is that a great deal of the carbohydrates that we eat have those bad fats in them anyway so it'd be kind of a double whammy if you give up the fats you're giving up the carbohydrates too sleep better gotta sleep better sleep better sleep better i could i could do an hour talking about intermittent fasting and i think that's one of those things that if i understand right is something that's kind of caught on where you hear more people talking about intermittent fasting and it's kind of a mystery as to what it is i'm going to try and show it here on the chart but it's kind of difficult to show because we're talking about a 24-hour day so it's kind of hard to show that in a in a linear way but the basic uh idea of intermittent fasting is so that so that we are eating when we eat during the day it's it is a in a short time window okay so let's let's say this is noon and this is this is the time during our day uh let's say this is midnight um midnight okay so what i was so a really easy example so there are 24 hours in this day a real easy example is is if i have my first meal at noon and then my second meal at four o'clock so lunch and dinner that means i've eaten in a four hour window so i have two meals no snacks i have a four hour window that means the the 20 hours is fasting but we sleep for about eight hours so we're automatically going to have we're gonna have an easy eight in there so this is a 20 hour fast if your last meal isn't at four it's at six well that's still an 18 hour fast so you're adding on to yours on the ends of your sleep and trying to have your meal in a in a short window so you're going to hear people talk about uh one meal a day or omed or whatever whatever they say those are people and and i've done this successfully and it's really really awesome so if you're having one meal a day that means you're fasting for like 23 24 hours and so it's just like well what's this you know what's all this fasting you know about what's why is fasting good and all that sort of stuff isn't that you know doing without food is bad you'll die you know it's what happens is you know how i was talking about the magic of when you park your car at night wouldn't it be cool if it could do a diagnosis and and repair all of its stuff what happens with the human body and there's tons of science behind this what happens with the human body is after we have fasted for 16 hours and that's sort of like the minimum but after we have fasted for 16 hours there are all of these mechanisms that that kick in in our bodies that start to repair repair on us on a cellular level and those things don't kick in though until after it's been we've been fasting for 16 hours and that means no food i mean you can do water you can do tea you know no sweeteners but but no food you can't spike your insulin like i was showing you in that first chart you can't spike your insulin so just imagine if you could take your car into the shop and say well it's not running right i need you to i need you to work on it but i'm only going to give you two hours well they're just going to go well we can't we can't repair do much repair we can't do a diagnostic and repair in two hours but what if you took your car into the shop and you said you can have as long as you want they would just be like okay that would give them a chance to get in there and really dive into it and really make all of these really really great repairs well that's what that's what fasting is like is we're giving our car as much time as we possibly can to do those repairs and if we're eating the right foods if if our carbohydrates are low it makes fasting way way way the way way easier i mean i when i first started doing intermittent fasting i was doing my my window wasn't four hours it was eight hours and i tried to get it down to six i whittled it down to six and that was that was hard trying to have my lunch and my dinner in within six hours of each other and so i lowered my carbohydrates even more my carbohydrate intake even more and then i got it down to six and four now i can do i can do one meal a day i can do usually it's like three hours so i'll so i will eat lunch at like around 11 or 12 maybe one and three hours later i can tell that that i can tell that i'm actually really hungry because all of that good stuff that in there is gone that was one of the most amazing things with with this journey of me was was when i began to realize when i was actually really hungry not just oh it's time to eat or i would like to eat now or this sounds good to where i'm just going holy crap i i am genuinely hungry right now um so that's that's that's kind of what the intermittent fasting thing uh does it is magical and so i uh and again i was talking about you know like at christmas time when i'm still doing my apple cider vinegar and i may not be eating a you know a good carb free diet i'm still intermittent fasting so even when i'm having a you know an off day i'm just i still don't eat breakfast i still just have something at lunch and then have something at dinner because it just becomes part of your normal way of doing things your body gets used to it it just becomes becomes a normal habit so i intermittent fast every single day we have choices that's what this is all about is we need to make better choices about what we uh what we eat because by by the choices that we make all of the choices that we make you know they're all they're all connected we can improve uh we can improve our lives and improve every aspect of our lives and when we improve our lives make our lives better the the people around us it makes their lives better also i mean what what we are we put out i just i i just can't tell you how important it is because i want all of you to be as healthy as you possibly can your healthiness and your happiness they go together and it just all comes down to those choices and those those nano steps to make better better better choices make changes right now there is a healthier person inside of all of us so we're all on the scale from zero to 100 and zero is the person who isn't doing anything to improve their life and 100 is the person who is climbing a mountain to uh to a natural spring to get water and they're growing their own food and they're you know they're hiking up that mountain and they're that's that's the hundred person and then there's the zero person who doesn't do anything well we're all in here somewhere i mean all of us are and that's okay as long as we are moving toward moving toward the that 100 end because as time passes we naturally fall toward the zero end and so we just need to ask ourselves will i be more fit or less fit in the future five years 10 years because odds are i'm going to be less fit just because i'm aging there's an ancient proverb that says the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago the second best time is today", "ReYIHGjmIXI": "hey everyone this is jenny from homestead corner and today we're canning [Music] garlic [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so one of my dear friends gifted me this beautiful basket of goodness and we are not going to be able to use all this before it goes bad if i don't preserve it so today we're going to be canning some of this up and i'll take what i don't can today i will be dehydrating which i've done a video on that and i'll put a link up top here somewhere so you can check that out if you want to dehydrate it and make powder you could do that as well but and before i go any further this is not usda approved this is something i do that works for my family so um definitely research it it might work for you it might not it's you know it's one of those things do what you feel is safe that's what i say and so we're going to go ahead and start peeling [Music] that took forever oh my goodness so i got three quarts of garlic all peeled here so i'm going to go ahead and i've got my jars in the canner over here and to get them sterilized they're heating up and we'll let them boil for 10 minutes and we're going to put our vinegar in a pot for we're just going to bring it up to a boil so i'm just going to pour in oh a couple quarts of vinegar because i got three quarts we're going to put these in eight ounce jars so i'm going to need a couple quarts of vinegar for this and i'm not gonna pickle with pickling spice but um but we are going to use vinegar because that is going to keep our garlic nice and fresh so our jars have been boiling for 10 minutes we've brought our vinegar up to a boil i have all my garlic peeled and my lids are in warm water i like to do that especially if i'm water bath canning you don't want them boiling but and you don't have to do it the ball doesn't recommend that you do it anymore but i'm just used to it and it works for me so that's what i do and so i'm going to take my jars out of the boiling water one at a time and i don't i only like to do one at a time because i want to make sure everything stays super duper hot and clean so we're just going to pull one jar at a time so i've got i'm doing eight ounce jars you can do this in pints as well i've done it that way but i we use um the eight ounce jazz work better for us so that's what i use for garlic and i'm going to leave one inch headspace in here so these jars are super hot and you can see you can shake these down a little bit you might be able to get another piece in there or a smaller one and stick them in there but you want to keep them about one inch headspace and then i'm going to cover this with some boiling hot vinegar and this vinegar is going to preserve it and it's almost like a pickled uh pickled garlic but i'm not adding the pickling spice and if you wash this off really good afterwards you cannot taste the vinegar it just tastes like fresh garlic so you want to rinse it really really well if you do this method so once i have it covered in vinegar i'm just gonna make sure everything is in there and covered and de-bubbled you want to de-bubble everything get as many bubbles out as you can we only use vinegar and garlic in this jar but i just want to make sure there's nothing on the rim just in case and then we're going to add our clean warm lid and a ring and i'm going to pop this back in the canner and start filling more jars so we're just going to repeat the process i'll do it one more time for you and we're just going to fill it up with fresh peeled garlic in there shake it around see if you can get a couple more pieces in there we go they're kind of hard so they don't squish really but it's a little piece maybe we can yeah we can get that in there and then i'm going to fill it up with vinegar and a couple of these jars i want to give it a little bit of heat so i like a little bit of spice so i'm going to put in some crushed red pepper not a whole lot because this is really a small jar so i'm just going to put a tiny bit in here but this is going to give it just that little kick of spice oh maybe a quarter teaspoon put that in there just a little bit those will be my spicy ones make a couple jars of those and the rest we will do plain and you could add pickling spice to this you could add dill to this that's really good as well you want to make sure it's all de-bubbled but you could really mix this up any way that you like we're just going to give that a wipe and get a little in and you ring and these are super hot and you just want these finger tight just like any canning if you use these two fingers you're not going to over tighten it that way that's what i found when i first started i really you know all the time i use those fingers now i know the pressure pretty much so we'll get that into the canner and i'm going to keep going and i'll bring you guys back we got our first seven jars in the canter we're gonna bring this up to a boil and we're gonna process it for 10 minutes and there you have it canned garlic yum so happy to have this on the shelf you can see the ones with the hot peppers have turned a little bit yellowish and that is perfectly okay and normal and these are looking fabulous over here we had a couple that look a little bit blue let's see if i can grab one of these you can see on this one here that it's got a little blue hue to it and that's okay it's still good there's nothing wrong with it it's sometimes when you can stuff it changes color a little bit and garlic tends to turn a little bit blue but it's still delicious and great for cooking and all kinds of good stuff and that's why the usda is not going to improve canon garlic because it does change color a little bit when you can and not all of it does it but sometimes you'll get that blue hue but the other ones look absolutely great they're still nice and white and beautiful and that's it canon garlic it really is super simple and easy and we have 15 8 ounce jars of garlic to put up in the pantry if you like this video give us a thumbs up subscribe we'll see you in the next video bye", "WmXg1Zt7nsU": "[Music] hi friends welcome to another of my life enhancing video episodes i love sharing useful knowledge with you it makes me so happy in today's video i will be sharing with you a recipe to make sun dried garlic powder with some tips to prevent garlic powder from hardening and clumping together it's really a simple method and will preserve the garlic for at least a year research has shown garlic to have numerous health benefits and is an excellent natural remedy for a wide range of ailments garlic has the power to boost immunity and fight off diseases garlic is one of the best foods on the planet for health garlic has been used for thousands of years as a natural remedy in ancient times it was used to treat wounds parasites and intestinal disorders nowadays this bulb is used as a delicious cooking ingredient and is dried and ground to create garlic powder garlic powder is classed as a spice and is used to add flavor to meals garlic contains a powerful compound called allicin which is a natural antibiotic this compound destroys any parasites viruses bacteria or fungi from within the body and strengthens the immune system garlic powder can be a good remedy for people suffering from a coal it can be added to a glass of water and taken as a drink it quickly clears the airways and breaks down mucus or phlegm many have described this as the best natural medicine in the world studies have shown that garlic powder can significantly lower blood pressure and treat those suffering with hypertension garlic contains healthy doses of manganese vitamin b1 b6 and c selenium calcium copper potassium phosphorus and iron garlic is also good for people who suffer with heart or cardiovascular problems how to make garlic powder to make garlic powder from fresh whole garlic the first step is to peel and clean the garlic it is then thoroughly washed and dried of any surface moisture i in this video i am using the pre-peeled garlic cloves they come in packs of 500 grams the second step is to slice the garlic as thinly as possible this will speed up the drying process i am using a vegetable slicer to slice the garlic thinly it seemed at first difficult and time consuming but when i actually tried it out it was easy and rather quick it took me less than half an hour to slice all the 500 grams of garlic the garlic pieces went through the slicer easily and i didn't get my fingers cut moreover the garlic slices were thin enough the garlic slices have to be completely dried first before they can be powdered this can be achieved by a number of ways they can either be sun dried or oven dried using a dehydrator for this purpose would be ideal when using the oven to dry the garlic slices use the lowest heat setting possible dry the garlic slices until they are completely crunchy dry i simply dried the garlic slices in two trays under direct sunlight for two days and they were completely dry using an oven to dry the garlic is the fastest way to get crispy garlic slices the final step in this recipe is grinding the garlic slices to a powder this can be done using even a pestle and mortar but i use the normal blender and it was powdered in seconds [Music] using this recipe keeps the garlic fresh for at least 1 year freshly ground garlic powder there is something important i like to mention here when making garlic powder garlic powder tends to clump together and will eventually harden over a period of time this is especially so in hot and damp tropical weather to avoid this garlic powder should always be stored in an airtight container with a dehydrator such as however the clumpy garlic powder can be loosened up and re-blended again to a powder sometimes just doing this alone will also be not effective now the question arises how else to store garlic powder so it remains fresh in a powder state from experience the best way to store garlic powder is to store it in the freezer section of the refrigerator as this is the driest part of the refrigerator the garlic powder will remain fresh and in powder form for a long time add this wonderful garlic powder to your foods to add flavor and health benefits that's all my friends thanks for watching a like is always appreciated i wish you great health wealth and happiness [Music] you", "6rzORnBCfy4": "[Music] garlic is one of the most popular crops to grow and fall and for good reason it's a super long season crop there's a ton of different varieties and while it is a relatively easy plant to grow I find that many people myself included in the past have had some problems growing garlic so in today's video this will be the first part of a multi-part series on growing garlic from the seed garlic or the clove so in this video we're gonna be talking about hard neck burst soft neck different varieties including all these ones you see here bed preparation and planting and mulching as well as just some general garlic tips on timing pre-soaking etc so stay tuned if you want to be 100% notified of updates to this garlic series please make sure and like and subscribe otherwise you just won't know that the next parts out but without further ado let's go ahead and talk about the different types of garlic so when it comes to garlic there's really two sort of classifications that matter that would be soft neck or hard neck I'm gonna discuss soft neck first because I am growing in a warmer climate if you're growing in a colder climate heart neck is a little bit more suitable although you can still make hard neck work down here in zones 10 b9 etcetera but the first one we're looking at here this is California early this is the most commonly cultivated garlic in America I believe and for good reason as the name suggests it can grow in many different climates it does not require a super cold season it's a soft neck garlic variety so it's a little bit more productive as far as bulb size and it comes to maturity relatively easy so that's a soft neck garlic and as you might imagine the difference between soft neck and hard neck is the neck and so let's take a look at this garlic right here this is Thai purple garlic this one as you can see has a hard neck in the middle now the difference between these two and there are quite a few is not only the neck but the flavor oftentimes hard neck varieties are said to have a more garlicky flavor whereas soft neck varieties can be a little bit more mild now that's kind of up to your own palate but I do find that holds to be the case with this hardneck garlic for example this Thai purple has a little more fire a little more spice a little more variety and distinction in the flavor that is within these beautiful cloves here now these typically also do require a cold period they require vernalization to really produce well and so what I've done here in my warm climate here in San Diego California is I've faked the vernalization period what that means is I've taken my hardneck garlic Slyke for example this one right here this is Shandong I've taken these and all research indicates that the longer you can keep them in - in the fridge up to about three months or so the better eight weeks being the minimum I could get about six weeks so I've had these in the fridge for six weeks in a folded brown paper bag and that's just to not completely suffocate them but not also dry them out completely either so decent amount of humidity you don't want to really desiccate these things so these are actually still a little bit cold as I've just pulled them out now another difference between hard neck and soft neck garlic is that with your soft necks like again the California early that I'll pull out right here the clove structure is quite different there's way more cloves per bulb on soft neck than hard neck because of that hard neck that's going through the middle that prevents clove formation right there and so you typically have is larger but lower amount of cloves on the hard necks and you have more cloves but they're generally smaller per clove on the soft necks now there is a third type of garlic kind of this is elephant garlic it is actually closely related to the leek much more close to the leek than it is to garlic but this is one single clove of elephant garlic for comparison here's our Shandong hardneck garlic variety it's relatively the same in size so elephant garlic true to its name is a massive producer we will be planting this in this video but there are some special planning considerations when it comes to elephant garlic I'm just gonna wrap it far through a couple of the varieties that I am deciding to grow for this season so first of all we have the classic this is kind of my failsafe this is California early it's very very well suited to my climate next we have Spanish Roja a hard neck gar variety with a bit larger of a bulb and just a really interesting look to it we then have Thai purple you can tell because of this purple striping on the garlic that looks amazing we have the Shandong that I've referenced a couple times here we also have a Georgian crystal this is a very distinct hardneck garlic and you can almost see 1 2 3 4 cloves per bulb on this particular one that I just pulled up next we have inch Eliam red I've been told this is a fantastic producer so we're gonna try this guy out then we have lowers Italian which is supposed to be most mostly just like a classic Italian variety of garlic we have Shawn and I'm gonna show you this one's very interesting the coloration on Shawn is very very purple on the skin so I'm just very intrigued by this one and excited to grow it and then finally like I said we have our elephant garlic and I've got three cloves of that elephant garlic so those are the varieties were working with now what we need to talk about is some timing and pre prep for the cloves and then we'll talk about what to do in the actual garden when growing garlic of course you need to separate your bulbs into their constituent cloves but what's really important here is to be very discriminatory when you're doing this and only make sure to plant the largest clothes so let me go ahead and dismantle this Loras Italian garlic right here and then I'm going to be very very particular about the ones that I decide to plant because this is a long season crop and the very last thing I want to do is put a long season crop in and not use the best best cloves that I possibly can so here I am separating all this out one just went flying but it seemed pretty small there's a lot of the paper that I need to filter out here and let's say I just want I don't know five or six bulbs of my lures Italian so it's sorted out like this is a very large clove and in fact nope it's actually two two cloves but this is still a pretty good sized clove right here so I'm gonna separate that one out see what you get with soft Nick garlic you see all these like tiny little cloves you don't want to plant something like this it's just not going to do that much for you so this I mean like look at the drastic size difference between to which would you plan I'm gonna go with this guy right here so I'm gonna set these all aside and don't feel that you're wasting you of course you can just go ahead and use this garlic as garlic and so these to me look like the most promising ones over here perhaps this one and maybe this one here or or this one the rest of these are all very very small and they're going to make their way into my cooking into my kitchen or as garlic powder these are going to be the ones that I'm using of my lowers Italian now the little cloves are separated what we're gonna do is something that I haven't done when planning my garlic can it is an optional step and that would be a pre-soak so here I have 8 cups of water and what I'm gonna do is add two key ingredients we have some baking soda and we have a little bit of fish fertilizer you can use kelp fertilizer I just didn't have any on hand and what this is gonna do is it may help start the rooting process just a little bit faster similar to when you pre soaked other types of seeds even though these are clothes not seeds so we're gonna sprinkle about one and a half tablespoons of baking soda in here and then what we'll also do is mix in just a little bit of this fish fertilizer it can be a little stinky again I would recommend kelp I just don't have any on hand so we're gonna try the next best thing and we're just gonna give it a little bit of a couple dollops here this is from Alaska I really like their fish fertilizer product but we're gonna mix this in and then I prepped separate jars because the last thing you want to do is have just spent all this time separating and filtering out your best clothes and then mix them all up together so we're gonna do that and I'm gonna let this soak no longer than 18 hours so honestly a couple hours is good we may do it in the morning tomorrow we'll kind of see how it goes but now we're just gonna put these all in their mason jars let them soak and I highly recommend that you label the jars or have a labeling system I have my whiteboard here that I'll know and I'll just place the jar right over the label garlic is an extremely heavy feeder throughout the season this grows in a long long season so we need to make sure we do our bed prep correctly I've got a three foot by four foot bed here we're gonna add a couple different amendments just to make sure that we're getting our garlic off to the right start you don't need to go crazy at the beginning of your garlic's life though what I will say is you want some kind of compost I have some soil conditioner here I have alfalfa meal and I also have neem cake fertilizer so you guys know neem oil mean cake is the pressed cake that's the left after extracting the oil it still has a lot of anti pathogenic and anti pest properties and it also has a pretty decent nitrogen phosphorus potassium ratio so we're gonna add that in there but before we add in all of our amendments and prepare our bed we do want to make sure we loosen the soil a significant amount garlic wants a nice loose soil so this is very much overkill for the a bed of this size but I do have a quick little broadfork that I'm gonna hit this with and just gently loosen the soil up we're gonna add a couple inches of this compost we're gonna add a handful or two of the neem cake we're gonna add a little bit of the alfalfa meal as well after that we need to make sure we mix it in nice and good [Music] make sure you pick these guys out while you're at it so while our garlic is soaking let's go ahead and talk about spacing and depth I like to use something like this a dipper you could use literally anything that pokes a hole in the ground but for most of these varieties anywhere from four to six inches apart is a good idea so I start in the corner giving my corner a little bit of extra room and then I just come around and I start laying out by planting a little bit of diagonal action can also help now the only thing I'll say is that when you're doing elephant garlic which again is closely related to the leak it will put out bubbles and so you'll need to space them out quite a bit further than you would a normal garlic and I honestly would recommend growing them in a separate area so I would probably end up doing mine in containers which is what I'll end up doing so let's go ahead and mark the rest of this out so that when our garlic is finished soaking you can just go ahead and get straight to planting [Music] it's the morning we have let our garlic soak and the first thing to know is the planning direction which is very intuitive I hope but let's go ahead and mention it so you want to go roots down and stem side up so pointy side up otherwise your garlic gonna be in a whole lot of trouble as far as planting depth for your garlic I've got my California early here and this is gonna be climate dependent most of us grow through fall that experiences of frost and so you want your garlic to be protected from that frost and certainly to root up and have a robust root system before the frost comes so if you're in a colder zone you plant deeper maybe four to six inches deep I'm gonna plant about two inches deep and then we'll go ahead and talk about the mulch and remember pointy side up [Music] we're planted in it is now mulch time so again colder climates more mulch warmer climates still you can use a lot of mulch but you don't have to go super super hard on the mulch I'm gonna do about three inches or so sometimes it's recommended up to four to six inches if you are in those extremely cold zones you just don't want these to go through a freezing and thawing cycle because that's gonna push them up to the surface and it's just not that good for a young developing garlic clove so let's go ahead and mulch it up so garlic can take anywhere from a couple weeks to a little bit over a month depending on the depth that you plant into that to actually come out and sprout so definitely be patient after you've planted your garlic but that's it for this first part of the garlic series much like my dragon fruit series which you can watch if you look in the upper right hand corner I'm gonna do this in parts garlic's extremely long season crop I'm not gonna be harvesting this until probably the end of spring next year 2020 and it's November right now in 2019 so follow along definitely hit the subscribe button if you'd like to be notified of updates and then over here and over here and over here and over here there's a bunch of different things that you can check out that are also in the epic gardening universe like the podcast all the social everything else so until next time good luck in the garden and keep on growing", "-StFwATpEs0": "hi everyone just for sweets here today we are going to do some make-ahead garlic I buy garlic at Costco in this huge bag and I never go through even this much of it before it's mouldy and bad and I have to throw it away and again that's waste and I'm trying to pinch some pennies so I'm gonna show you how to prevent that from happening now you can either go there and split it with someone and that helps but you still probably don't go through that much garlic unless you own a restaurant or something so I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna preserve mine because I just threw my last bag away a couple weeks ago and I bought a new one and I swore to myself I'm not gonna let that happen again it's just a complete waste so to do it this way you'll have it all pre-made and when you make your you know cook your dishes and stuff all you have to do is take your jar out you've seen jarred garlic's in the grocery store you're just gonna make your own I think this bag of garlic cost me maybe $4 I think it's $4 right around there and so I'm just gonna take one of my mason jars and my little mini food processor and don't mind it it's been through the wringer I have used it for years and years this little processor cost me like $9 at Christmas time one year and I've used it to death so all you need is your fresh garlic now you can use bulbs and do it that way but I'm just trying to preserve what I have I have some grapeseed oil here and you can use olive oil if you'd like to or you can even use like a canola oil but I'm gonna use grapeseed oil today and go ahead and just put your garlic in here it's very simple I fill it up I don't know about halfway and I do it to a pretty fine chop I'll show it to you here you can see it's not too fine but it's not super big and chunky it's not a paste by any means so what you're gonna do at this point is we're gonna take that blade out very carefully get that garlic off of there you can see how much car like this makes it is so much and I think those jars of garlic in the store they're probably roughly right around $5 for a jar and it's a much smaller jar than this one and I think it's half the size of this one and you can probably I would say with all that garlic in there I get two of these full-sized jars so right there you are saving money especially if you like to cook with garlic like I do and it's gonna preserve it a lot longer having it in the oil and in the canning jar so basically you're gonna gently just put it in there as I get it everywhere and that's okay you know the best thing to do would probably be to put a paper plate or something underneath it and then that way as it falls the plate catches it and I will do that after I do this batch and then that way you don't lose any because you can take it right off the plate and stick it right into the jar cuz I just lost a big scoop Bowl alright so you continue this process go ahead and push that in there and you can see just that one handful of garlic how much it made into that jar and I still have this huge bag so you you're gonna get a couple jars at least out of this and then what you want to do is you want to keep grinding and I'm gonna add a little bit of oil in between each one probably right around a tablespoon I don't want it too super oily but just enough that it helps preserve it a little bit so you're gonna continue with this process until you finish the jar and you will stick that in your fridge and keep it refrigerated and have that in there for every time that you cook so I'll come back and show you within the jars full all right so we're back we got the jar all full and you can see that I used approximately a half a bag of my garlic so you can definitely make two full jars and these these are the quart size jars I'm so bad at remembering things I'm so sorry these are the quart size jars I wanted to make sure I didn't want to give you the wrong information so you could probably make with one bag of garlic at least fill two quart size jars and I filled it up and finally got smart and used my little funnel here didn't even think about that when I was doing the first step so if you have your canning funnel use that make sure you wash it out right away because the garlic will stick to it and then you don't want to make it taste like garlic so at the very end here what we're gonna do is I just took a better knife and I kind of stuck a hole right down the center and I did the same steps where I put in my garlic and then my tablespoon of grapeseed oil olive oil or canola oil and keep doing that process now at the very end I want to put a little funnel in there of oil because I want it to go a little bit further down so I'm gonna put another tablespoon or so down the center and then just kind of stir it in there a little bit cuz like I said I don't want this too greasy but I want it to be able to preserve and sorry although got in there preserve and not mold up on this so fast and they tend to last a lot longer in the jars and then I did put it on the paper towel so if you want to pick up the excess you can pick up the excess and stick it in there or you can just pick it up and throw it away alright so you put a lid on it and I'm gonna go ahead and make my second jar now if you want to just jar half of it and leave half that you can do with each meal you can do that as well but I will let you know that once this is opened it starts going bad within a week or two so it's probably best to just use it the first time and then go ahead and pre grind it and put it in your canning jars so I wanted to share that little tidbit with you it is something I have never done but have been striving to make myself do because all I do is throw away my fresh garlic and have to keep buying it and it's just a complete waste so you can get a lot of garlic for four dollars and there it is this is how you preserve your fresh garlic all you need is fresh garlic and some and a canning jar and you are good to go oh and a food processor to chop it unless you want hand chop it so anyway I hope it gave me a thumbs up on this and share this on your Facebook page as well as joining my Facebook pages just for sweets and my group page recipe book and I hope you all have a wonderful day and until next time next video save your pennies everyone god bless", "v86Jdx3Y0qo":

pepper tree seasonings I'm Ryan Lopez and today I'm going to show you how to easily crack peel and mince garlic fresh garlic cloves and so we have a few fresh garlic cloves here it's great and what you want to do is you want to start off by just holding it upside down with the palm of your hand and pushing it down until it cracks completely then you separate the individual cloves out and this is great because what your what this is gonna do for you is it's gonna make it very easy to when you have to do use a lot of garlic and you know it takes a lot of time normally if you don't know how to do this to actually peel and mince all of this but we're gonna show you how to do it it's gonna be extraordinarily easy so again we're going to take a second clove we're gonna hold it upside down push down breaking up the clove separate out the individual cloves here so now that we have the individual clothes separated I'm going to take a glass jar and I like to use a longer jar with a flat bottom and a flat top that way it has something to really slam against to get these peels off I'm gonna put all of these into the jar you're gonna put the cap back on and then you're gonna shake it vigorously for about five seconds all right then you're gonna pour them out and then you're gonna separate out all the loose stuff so what this did was it really started to peel away the outer layer that's that skin that you want and it makes it very easy to basically just fall right out of the skin and some of these are just already completely skin free and that just makes it extraordinarily easy to get these things completely skin free and separated in a very quick way so after that you just have to mince them up and we're ready to go so now we have all of our cloves completely peeled and ready to mince but first I want to show you one little trick you might be saying Ryan okay that's look great you need a lot of you know garlic but what if you only need one or two or three cloves something like that well that's where this little trick comes in handy so you're gonna break it just the same way and then you're gonna get just a couple of cloves out just as many as you need so you got three now this is how we're gonna do it so this is where it gets hard you're gonna take your individual garlic clove completely completely with the peel on just out of the close out of the garlic head itself and you're going to put it between your hands and you're just gonna rub there you go that simple and there you go three garlic cloves very very simple completely filled now you can mince them chop them slice them whatever you need to do and makes it so easy to do that now we're gonna go ahead and mince the garlic if we try to chop or mince your garlic with it whole like this it tends to move around a lot and it's really precarious and you don't get a good good chop on that so what we actually want to do is we're going to take with the side of your chef's knife just gonna press it down and smash it that way when you start chopping it doesn't move so now from there you just chop away use your fingers as a guide chop down your fingers don't chop your fingers off but go nice chopped garlic that's a coarse chop if you want it finer you just start chopping it finer and that is the easiest way to chop garlic using your chef's knife so I would say that that was the easiest way to get minced garlic however if you are lazy like I am you can always go to the store and buy yourself a jar of pre-minced garlic thank you very much I'm Ryan Lopez pepper tree seasonings I hope you found this helpful", "N9TOWlFJI5E": " Strawberries are so tasty these days, right? It tastes better if you make it into dessert. Today, I'm going to show you four strawberry desserts. First, I'll make the strawberry puree that I need when I make dessert. The ratio of strawberries to sugar is 3:1. If you leave it for about 30 minutes, moisture will form like this. Boil over medium heat for about 10 minutes, take the pot off the fire and crush the strawberry with a hand blender. Boil it again for 3-5 minutes and it's done!!! Finally, add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. I'm going to make a cheesecake that doesn't need an oven. The digestive biscuits are good to use on the bottom of the cake. If you don't have a mousse ring, it's okay to use a pound cake mold. Put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Gelatin is a must because it's a no-oven cake. (This is the gelatin I've melted earlier.) Mix it with the cream cheese that made earlier, it's almost done. Put it in the fridge for more than 3 hours. I packed one to share with my customers. \ud83c\udf81 This is mine! I used the strawberry puree for decoration. Iced Americano for today! It has cream cheese, but it's light and it's not too sweet, but it's a refreshing taste. Let me introduce a very simple strawberry dessert. Mix strawberries and sugar. Pretzel snacks are lightly crushed and mixed with melted butter. Mix yogurt with brown sugar. Stack in order. (I picked what's fallen up and ate \ud83d\ude0b) Put in a pinch of cinnamon, and the strawberry pretzel parfait is complete! You can feel the sweet, salty, creamy and crispy taste in a cup. A roll cake that tastes so good with milk. I don't eat it often, but I like it. Bake in an oven preheated to 340\u2109 for 10 minutes. I added strawberry puree to the whipped cream and made it pink. Keep it in the fridge for more than an hour and eat. I'm going to prepare strawberry latte to eat with the roll cake. I used new brand whipped cream, but I was sad that it was watery. I liked the combination of the freshness of strawberries and soft cake. Divide the sugar into three times. Add the eggs separately so that it mixes well. Put the sifted powder in. Keep whipping.\ud83d\ude05 After adding the last milk, this pretty batter is complete. Bake in an oven preheated to 340\u2109 for 40 minutes. Ooops!!! The shape of the top of the cake is a bit ruined. Queen Victoria's favorite, Victoria's cake is complete. The shape is a bit ruined, but I covered it with decoration.\u270c\ud83c\udffb Before the strawberry season is over, make a delicious strawberry dessert.\ud83d\ude09 Thank you for watching to the end. 'Subscribe' and 'like' are big helps to me.\u00a0\u2764", "KZZnJfmLXaQ": "all right a chef booked here today we're roasting up some garlic which is super simple to do easy peasy lemon squeezy this is just one thing you can do with roasted garlic use it as a spread for bread but there are just as iliyan billion things you can do I'm going to do four bulbs of garlic because it's a little bit of a pain in the bud and I'm not just going to roast one one bulb of garlic you know I want to have a nice you know I want to have a nice payoff because I'm going to keep this in my fridge and use it for all kinds of things now some people when they roast it they just like to cut the top off the bowl throw a little olive oil in there and roast it whole but I don't like to do that seems like a waste of garlic to me you know I want to use the whole entire bulb I don't want to waste any of it and I don't want to fool you know with getting it out of here and squeezing it out of here later after it's been roasted so I go ahead and I break it apart and take the skins off the individual cloves now I don't have a trick or a tip for getting them off easily I've read you know in various sites that you can put it in a pan or a jar when tighten it up and shaking and then the skins will just come off after you shake it for twenty or thirty seconds but that never works for me but I like to get it with nice tight skins on there because I don't want to get old funky garlic you know I like I like it as fresh as I can get it and then I shake shake shake and the skin doesn't come off you know so mi do mi not powerful enough if somebody has a tip on how to anyway to do it faster let me know because when I use this method here I mean it's like reverse time-travel it's like back to the future to you know look the thing actually comes back together again I can't explain it so I don't need food with that I just go ahead take the bulb apart and then I individually take the skins off of each garlic clove and then I don't have to fool with it anymore and it's not going to take that long anyway it's not like painting the Sistine Chapel it's not like we're climbing Mount Everest we're just taking the damn skins off garlic which is kind of simple you just take a knife set it on there give a little whack with your palm and then that's it you know you break the skin it kind of peels right off some of them are easier than others but really it's on rocket science you know the main thing is you got to have a light touch you know like boom just like you were hitting your your nephew on the head just to get his attention that's all just a little light touch because you don't want to smash it but you know this took me about ten minutes you know 10 solid minutes and boom there I have it I don't have to fool with them anymore I just throw them out on some aluminium foil as they say across the pond and then I'm just going to throw a little bit of olive oil on here some salt some pepper and then you can put whatever kind of herbs and seasonings you want I'm gonna use a little thyme just some dry thyme and I'm gonna rub it between my hands and get it on there and then we're going to take the aluminium foil and then fold it up you know like when you get food to go and they turn it into a nice swan this is going to be kind of like that but it doesn't look like a swan you know it looks like a like a volcano maybe and then we're going to take that we're going to slide it into an oven preheated at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and let it roast away for about 30 to 40 minutes you know I think this went for about 35 minutes and then it was set and I couldn't let it go longer you know Phi to let it go for 45 minutes or 50 minutes it would have been fine it just would have been a little softer you got to be careful when you're taking the foil apart you know cuz steam is gonna come up and you don't want to disfigure yourself you know with that scolding steam but you can eat them right now you know they're nice and soft and it's not like eating raw garlic once you roast it even just for a half-hour you know you can throw it in your mouth and it tastes muy fantastico look it look how bright I am I have my ear things in because I'm a rocket scientist but but I probably stood there and ate like five or six cloves just before I went on to my next thing which is taking it and making a little crostini which is one of my favorite things to do right after I roast garlic while it's still hot you know throw it on some bread and spread it around just like butter you could actually put butter on here or a little more olive oil and make it a little creamier but it's not necessary just the garlic by itself and throw a little cheese this is feta cheese which is fantastic if you use what did I use last time I think I got some blue cheese and did it last time and it was too the blue cheese was too overpowering so do feta cheese a little bit of capers and some kalamata olives kalamata olives that's just a great combo but you can use roasted garlic if you have day-old rice you know old rice or old quinoa you know it adds a great flavor you can throw it in mashed potatoes you can mash it up into salad dressings just all kinds of of uses for roasted garlic and it's so simple to do so give this recipe a try let me know what you think in bone Appetit and thanks for watching and subscribing and sharing and being all being the best you that you can be you know thanks for that I'll see you in the future", "KaUtS24RjAo": "okay preparing garlic these little beauties contain so much flavor they can make a real difference to your cooking and now in how to prepare it I know it sounds really basic and silly but it does change the way it tastes so think of a chip right the way a nice thin chip tastes different to a thick chip which tastes different to a roast potato which tastes different to a jacket potato and that's what you got to think in your head so a few different ways of dealing with it we've got a pure clove of garlic here all you got to do is put your hand in there give it a little scratch the fact that you've crushed that if you now roast that or fry that you'll get a very subtle sweet flavor happening so that's your first method of dealing with garlic the second one is obviously peeling it we'll take the end off here we do the same as crushing it give it a little squash and then literally the skin or just peel off of it and just sometimes they're awkward sometimes they're easy and then we slice it up so we're using that rocking action or the tapping action fingers tucked away we've got slicing out like that or rocking like that either way you get a nice sliced product so I just push that here and then another way to deal with the garlic is to finely chop it so literally like a mini version of the onion I'm going to slice it carefully this way and this is really tiny but you know it does actually work through the middle like that fingers out the way carefully and slowly and then rocking action looking at delicate and fine you can get and the best way to do is taste the difference yourself you will get absolutely different flavor from that if you're not happy with how fine it is use the rocking action which comes in here and you can get that real fine clear it off of the blade and then sweep that into our third pile there and then the fourth way of dealing with your garlic is to squash it and smush it and turn it into a paste squash it like this as flat as you can and then you get some sea salt and put a pinch of salt on top of the garlic like this and then you want to put the tip down and use the flex in your knife to crush and just squash it squash it squash it squash it squash it and then you can kind of scrape it up into a little line and squash it again until you get a puree and you'll get a completely different flavor there than you would - chopped sliced or squash so there's four different ways to prepare garlic and these will be relevant in different ways throughout the application and throughout my current and future recipes on the application but good stuff to know there you go there's the fourth pile four ways of preparing and dealing with garlic four totally different flavors easy", "cFtK37Cfqfc": "I'm going to show you an easy recipe for roasted garlic now roasted garlic is a perfect addition to any pizza well in my house it would be an appetizer or in addition to sauces mashed potatoes a little crushed odd there's so many so many ways that the use roasted garlic it's quite versatile and it gets very very sweet when you roast it now this roasted garlic very very simple what we're gonna do is take a fresh garlic it should be very firm and if you see any brown spots in the garlic it means that it has some aged and there are many types of garlic like elephant garlic or the more commercial garlic as I have here but what you want to do is this we're going to take a utility knife it's the one with sort of the little serrated edge and you're gonna cut a top of it so that you can expose the garlic then what we're gonna do is we're going to take in a foil pouch a little olive oil some salt and of course a little bit of cracked pepper now there are actually restaurants that have roasted garlic on their menu as an appetizer that come to the table really really hot out of the oven serve with little crostinis that you can just take and sort of spread it on your little crostini we're gonna make a little tent there's no fancy way as long as it's enclosed you can also flavor your garlic with different herbs like thyme basil or whatever herb that you like like rosemary 400 degrees the oven is set you don't want to get it too hot too fast you want it to really be able to slowly roast for about an hour and when you're ready you're gonna remove it from the oven in its little pouch and whether you're serving this as an appetizer or are you serving this for other sauce or pizza or mashed potatoes it makes great mashed potatoes and now what you got to do when it's done you can see how beautifully golden brown it is you want to just take a fork and you can just sort of remove those beautiful cloves of the roasted garlic so sweet so delicious what I do from this point is either just put it in with your potatoes or top your pizza with this or what you can do is do several heads and actually make and puree it in a food processor that I have here with a little olive oil and it keeps really well in an airtight container it's absolutely delicious it's so good for you as well but you can see how simple that is roasted garlic that is guaranteed to kick up the flavor in any dish that you're gonna prepare I hope you enjoy

stay on the bright side you", "rlsnAwoltBM": "now traditionally garlic is always planted on the shortest day of the year so June the 21st and it's harvested six months later on December the 21st but we don't have to stick to this anymore in the warmer parts of the country you can plant garlic anytime from May right the way through to August and in colder parts of the country you might want to get your crop in in late autumn because if the ground is too hard in the middle of winter you won't be able to get your garlic in possibly to leave an early spring now garlic planting is really easy this beds been prepared it's been composted it's all ready to go all you need is a hand and a thumb so the rule of thumb with garlic is that you plot your clothes about a hands length apart and roughly a thumbs length deep you don't want to get your thumb dirty you get a stick and you can mark it off like this the other rule is that you plant a bulb of garlic its own height deep in the ground in any event as long as it's not too deep it's going to grow so this is what's called a soft net variety it's got good flavor and you can plat the fists when they ripen and most of these cloves are big enough for planting so I'm just going to pull them out and we will position and plant these but I've also got a bit of a treat in here if you think Moe is a good-looking girl it close check these guys out this is what's called elephant garlic now it's actually related to a leek and these are going to produce some absolutely massive fist garlic still has a reasonably good flavor so I'm going to plant some of that at the back just for fun and games and boasting that will go over here now because this pigs been really nicely dug I don't want to compact it garlic lights good draining sauce up but a board here when I stand on this it's going to spread my load we go I'm excited about this pointy end up bottom end down roots come out of there shoots come out of there and then I just spin the board meter there and we'll place some of this stuff now I'm thinking a hands length between each clove on all sides so here we go thing is if you put plants too close to each other because you get really really excited about how much you're going to grow in the end you don't get as much back for your effort because if they're too close they compete for nutrients and for water and you just get less productive plants so it is well worth thinking about you're planting distance and kind of sticking to it so remember pointy end up fat end down that's where the roots come out and that's where the shoots come out now if you planted your garlic and later awesome in a colder area it probably won't move much until the soil starts to warm on the other side of winter but if it's reasonably warm when you're planting it then you can expect to see shoots within a couple of weeks now when you've enriched your soil properly you can pretty much leave your garlic to itself although if you're really keen on a bumper crop you can dress the soil around your garlic with some blood and bone meal every month if you're a vegetarian and blood and bone meals not your bag then you could use worm compost or possibly some sheep pellets but you might need to use it a little bit more often you could also feed your garlic as well once it's got foliage and it's starting to shoot you could feed it with liquid worm juice and it's a hardneck variety it may well put up a flower spike you don't really have to worry about these flower spikes they look a bit like a little green elfs hat and you just break them off put them in your salad put them in a soup but if you leave them then they might take some of the energy out of your garlic bulb that's developing below ground so your garlic is ready when long shoots start to go yellowy Brown and start to wither and fall back down towards the soil all you no need to do is carefully dig up your hopefully bountiful harvest with a fork and if you're thinking about saving seed be really delicate with those bunches of garlic and put them in a dry cool spot where they can dry out don't leave them lying on the bed if they get rained on then that can cause the fruit to split and the pet and the young skins to start to flake off so take your harvested garlic hang it up in a garden shed or garage and let it dry out before you then place it is that's what you want to do to store it or you just take it straight into the kitchen so that bed is now ready to go if you don't have much space garlic grows really well in containers if you want to find out more about growing garlic and containers things like buckets half barrels or pots check out garlic under the plant guide section of our website", "2V01oQ7zY5o": "welcome friends have you been watching\nTwitter and that garlic peeling hack that has taken Twitter by storm I\nwatched it and I gotta tell you I've tried really hard and I've sort of\nalmost mastered it and like any shortcut or hack or cooking technique that you\nneed to learn you need to learn the technique and there's a secret behind\nthis and I'm gonna let you in on that but for the most part I've almost got it\nperfect so you take your knife and you put it into the clove sort of at the\nbottom you put it in three-quarters of the way and then you twist and pull and\nit comes out just like that really kind of neat put it in twist and sometimes\nyou'll get a little bit of paper that's still on the outside but at that point\nyou've broken it to the point where it just peels off really easily like that\nput it into your pile now here is the trick\nit took me forever to figure this out I went through a lot of garlic yesterday\ncutting and trying and testing and I just couldn't come up with anything and\nthe first thing I thought was maybe it's the garlic I'm using most garlic's sold\nin supermarkets in North America is grown in China at this point vast\nmajority and it's soft neck garlic and it doesn't react the same way so I\nthought okay I'm gonna go out and get some hardneck garlic and try that and I\nhad no luck either way and then Julie came home and she looked at the video\nand she said well duh you've got to do this and here's what\nshe did and this is how we mastered it first thing you need is a really sharp\nparing knife and a short thick paring knife works better\nI found you take your bulb of garlic safety caveat if you're someone in the\nkitchen who is clumsy and doesn't work well with knives and is prone to cutting\nyourself don't use this method there are far better ways for you to peel garlic\nbut if you're confident in the kitchen with a really sharp knife here's what\nyou do hold your garlic down on your cutting board with\nthe root end up you take your knife and you hold it really well and you just cut\nhere at the bottom where the clove of garlic meets the root you need to sever\nthis and I got to tell you it is tough to do on some garlic you're not going to\nbe able to get your knife in no matter how sharp it is and you just have to\nwork it around and don't pry the bulbs out you just want to break the\nconnection to the root keep your fingers out of the way and just work your way\naround this little bit of prep is going to make all the difference okay now once\nyou've cut around the root end so you take your garlic bulb root side up take\nyour knife and put it in sort of here about two-thirds of the way down put\nyour knife in a fairway and then you twist and out it comes same on the next\none put your knife in very gently twist and out it comes along we go put your\nknife in twist and pull it out is it perfect\nnow it's not perfect is it going to work 99% of the time yeah is it easier than\ndoing it another way definitely if I had to peel a lot of garlic in the kitchen\nfor some dish this is definitely the way to go so give it a try\nlet us know in the comments what you think thanks for stopping by see you\nagain soon", "Dc7w_PGSt9Y": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the ultimate garlic peeling trick that's right i've learned a lot of things from martha stewart how to fold napkins how to cover turnip into the shape of rose how to make a shake out of a broken prison toothbrush but if all the things i've learned from her this garlic peeling trick might be the most useful so check this out we're gonna peel an entire head of garlic in like 20 seconds so what you're gonna need for this great technique is a head of garlic and then two metal bowls and it's easier if they're the same size but they really don't have to be as long as you can hold them together like this it's gonna work so step one here we're gonna take our head of garlic we're gonna give it a whack on the cutting board to loosen those clothes which we're gonna toss into one of our bowls and by the way you could just toss everything in including that papery skin i picked a bunch out just for the sake of filming but when you're doing this there's no need to do that just toss everything in and once we have our cloves in the bowl we are ready to commence peeling except we're not peeling or shaking simply cover the bowl of garlic with the second bowl hold them together and shake and after 20 seconds of vigorous shaking you're done that's it I'm not kidding the garlic's peeled check it out and even the ones that don't look peeled and didn't pop right out of the skin those are totally loose the skins loose just grab them with your fingers pull that skin off and remove those from the bowl and you will have like I said about 20 cloves of garlic in 20 seconds and I should add this is a fantastic way to win a bet with your foodie friends bet them like $1,000 or you're gonna peel a head of garlic and when you're done you will average less than 2 seconds per clove oh they will take that bet every time and they'll owe you $1,000 and you'll be so excited you'll find my paypal and send me like 200 of it I'm just kidding unless you're gonna do it so anyway I'm always getting a ton of emails for quick and easy techniques videos so thank you Martha and I think I could speak for both of us when I say we think you're gonna find this garlic technique very appealing so head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts blass not true there's no ingredients but you know what I mean head over to food wishes comm for more information and as always enjoy you", "beGZUJylPGE": "Alright, this is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com. Today we have another exciting episode for\nya coming at you from my backyard garden. Beautiful June day, later in the afternoon. I was out gardening earlier planting a whole\nbunch of new peppers out for the summer season. But this episode what we\u2019re gonna do is\nactually, we\u2019re gonna share with you guys when to harvest your garlic, right? Right here what we have behind me is a whole\nbed of garlic, and this was not the primary crop that actually I grew in this bed. The garlic was kind of like an afterthought\nor what I like to do in many cases intercropping. I like to plant, you know, multiple different\nitems in the same raised bed so I can actually have, you know, produce twice as much food\nat the same time. So earlier in the year this bed was actually\nplanted out with standard spinach transplants, probably around like end of October beginning\nof November. And when I planted those guys at the same\ntime I planted some garlic cloves, some hardneck garlic actually, some organic hardneck garlic\nactually, got up when I was on a trip to Utah last year. And so I planted those in at the same time. You know, I got many harvests of spinach during\nthe season. Finally the spinach went to flower and seed,\nit got cut out and removed so it\u2019s actually all gone now. But I did leave the garlic in place because\nthe garlic was not yet ready to be harvested. That was probably maybe like a month or so\nago. Now the garlic is nice and large, and it\u2019s\njust about ready to be harvested. I could let it go a little bit longer but\nI thought I\u2019d make a video for you guys and share with you guys when to harvest your\ngarlic and why I\u2019m harvesting it now. So this was planted end of October beginning\nof November. It\u2019s now beginning of June and we\u2019re ready\nto harvest. So it\u2019s basically the garlic from the clove\nto the full bulb that we\u2019ll be pulling out in a second, it has been a total of seven\nmonths. So here\u2019s the best way to know when to harvest\nyour garlic, alright? So, you want to look actually at the leaves\non the plant. So these are the little long blades \u2013 this\njust fell off \u2013 and you know we have green blades and we have some brown blades. And each one of these blades actually correspond\nwith on that bulb that you\u2019re familiar with as paper covering, right? As you can see I\u2019m peeling it off. So as the leaves turn brown on the bottom\nleaves that\u2019s part of this paper covering and if your leaves turn brown that means the\ncovering underneath the ground is actually kind of getting dissolved and kind of composting\nand breaking down. And if you let too many of your leaves on\nthe garlic go brown then basically all the paper covering or the literally natural wrapping\nof your garlic cloves will be disintegrated, your cloves will be, you know, exposed to\nthe soil, the bacteria, the worms, everything under the ground, and they can break down\nand not store as well. So for this reason you want to make sure that\nyou don\u2019t have too many brown leaves on your garlic like if all the leaves in your\ngarlic are brown, that means that underneath the ground all that paper covering is gone\nwhich is definitely not a good thing. So depending on who you ask you may want to\nhave like, you know, three or four leaves on the bottom brown. But it\u2019s basically a percentage of how many\nleaves you have total, so for example on this plant right here I got, let\u2019s see one, two,\nthree, four leaves that have already turned brown. And then I have five, six, seven, eight, nine,\nten, eleven, maybe twelve. So I have twelve leaves total, five of which\nhave turned brown. So that\u2019s you know not quite at half, so\nif you have half of the leaves already turned brown it\u2019s definitely time to harvest but\ngenerally what you want to do is when about one third of the leaves turn brown, that\u2019s\na fairly good indicator that it is time to harvest. In general also you want to check with at\nwhat time in your area do people generally harvest their garlic This may have to be offset\ndepending if you planted your garden on time or a little bit late. I usually tend to run a little bit late in\nplanting things because I\u2019m usually so busy so a lot of the garlic in the area has already\nbeen harvested, you know, even as early as late April or May and here I am in June just\nabout harvesting mine. I always want to leave my garlic kind of like\nin as long as possible so that they can bulb up and those cloves get nice and big. The other thing is I grew hardneck garlic\nas I mentioned, and the hardneck if you guys see have these garlic scapes. They kinda look like little birds, you know,\non the top. And the softneck which I have in another raised\nbed is not actually ready to be harvested yet. This hardneck is. But these scapes, once it starts to form the\nscapes, you know, a lot of the energy that goes to produce the bulb is probably going\nto go be going up into the scapes, so I like to harvest my garlic before the scapes are\nfully mature and start getting big. Another thing I\u2019ll do like in this case\nI just basically cut off the flowering scape and actually, yeah, I ate it for dinner a\ncouple nights ago. So I guess with that let\u2019s go ahead and\npull up one of these guys. Number one rule when harvesting garlic, don\u2019t\njust take the garlic \u201cokay John I\u2019m super strong I\u2019m gonna pull it up.\u201d If you just try to pull it up straight upright\nyou\u2019re probably going to damage your garlic, right? The stem is going to break before the garlic\nis unearthed. So for that reason people recommend using\na fork and all this kind of stuff. You know I\u2019m just growing garlic in this\nfour foot circular bed. This four foot circular bed has about three\ndozen garlic plants in there. It had a lot of spinach in there before. But I\u2019m just going to go ahead and dig it\nup with my hand. The best way I want to try to minimally disturb\nthe soil. So what I do is I take my finger and shove\nit right down near the stem and I basically just peel-- peel the soil back just a little\nbit to expose it from the top. And just run my finger around it right and\nthen I just basically carefull Wow these roots are stuck in there pretty good. Get my finger around it and try to get it\nunderneath and rip it up a little bit. Alright so there we go. There\u2019s my first harvested garlic. So, so to me you guys can see here is like\none leaf it\u2019s been already turned brown. Two leaves. Maybe two and three leaves. This guy still looks a little bit young. I think I\u2019m going to go ahead and leave\nthe rest of this bed in for a little bit longer. For these guys to develop a little bit larger. So yeah, we\u2019re going to come back out here\nin maybe a couple more weeks after these guys grow a bit more. And that\u2019s how it goes sometimes, you know,\nwhen you\u2019re gonna harvest. You can like decide to\u2014okay I\u2019m gonna\nharvest all these now even though they\u2019re a little bit small. And you can surely do that but you know in\nthis case we\u2019re gonna maybe wait a little longer on some of these other guys and maybe\nI\u2019ll be having some garlic fettuccini for dinner. Alright so I want to give you guys an update\non the garlic harvest. It\u2019s been probably about another one and\na half weeks since I made the original part of this video. And as you guys can see my garlic is still\ngrowing. These flowering tops are now opening. You know what I like to do is actually just\nto chop of all these flowers and just eat them because actually they\u2019re quite tasty. They have a nice garlic you know essence plus\nsome of the nutrients from the garlic. But now today I\u2019m really gonna harvest them\nbecause literally half the leaves have turned brown. Another tip I wanted to give you guys it\u2019s\nbest to harvest when the soil is dry like it is right now. And then you know some people like to like\nput in a shovel and dig up garlic. I don\u2019t like to damage any garlic with any\nkind of implements or tools I just like to use my hands. I mean, our hands are meant for digging. Maybe not as good as a dog but. I like to use my hands also this way I minimally\ndisturb the soil. So what I carefully do is I go around with\nmy finger and I just kind of remove the dirt that\u2019s right around the stalk coming out\nof the ground. And I can reveal the little garlic bulb here\ninside. And then I keep scooping the soil the way\nwith my finger all the way around until I get underneath it. And try to like loosen up some of the roots. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time\nto do this and one of the things you don\u2019t want to do in harvesting garlic is just pull\nup by the stem and yank it because if you do that you\u2019re probably going to break the\nstem which is definitely not a good thing. So once I got it kind of up you know I get\nmy kind of fingers two fingers underneath there, wiggle it up, as you guys can see harvested\nsome garlic. So what I want to do next for you guys is\nactually go ahead and harvest all this garlic and then I\u2019m going to show you guys how\nto actually cure your garlic harvest. This is a very important step to ensure your\ngarlic\u2019s gonna last for literally six months to a year. So now I just got done harvesting thirty six\nheads of garlic from my four foot round raised bed, and aside from knowing actually when\nto harvest your garlic probably one of the most important steps is to cure your garlic\nproperly. So what we\u2019re going to do next for you guys\nis actually show you guys how I\u2019m gonna cure this stuff and basically we\u2019re going\nto go into my greenhouse that actually has kind of a roof over it so it\u2019s not direct\nsun it\u2019s kind of like a more shaded location that gets some indirect sunlight. Whether you have a greenhouse that\u2019s not\nin full direct sunlight or even something like your garage that would be an excellent\nplace to cure your garlic so let\u2019s head inside and I\u2019ll show you guys how easy it\nis. So now I\u2019m in one of my greenhouses and\nwhat I\u2019ve done is basically by the rafters or what holds up the whole greenhouse along\nthe top I basically tied up these strings so they\u2019re just kind of hanging down I got\nlike four of them. And what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going\nto take maybe like ten heads. Two, three, four\u2014whoops\u2014five, six, seven,\nnine, ten. So I\u2019m just basically gonna tie these on\nup now the other thing I want to let you guys know is that I\u2019m not washing these cloves,\nright? I don\u2019t want to introduce any excess moisture\nthan I need to into these cloves before drying. The other thing is you know I harvested this\non a dry day before my watering system turned on so they\u2019re actually already pretty dry. So now I\u2019m going to show you guys actually\nhow to hang up the garlic super simple, super easy, doesn\u2019t take rocket science. So now the first thing I want to mention to\nyou guys though is I\u2019ve cut off all the scapes. I am growing a hardneck. I cut off all the scapes, I put them in some\nwater inside the kitchen I\u2019m just basically going to cut off and eat all the flowers inside\nsalads or soups. They\u2019re quite delicious. The other thing I want to let you guys know\nis you know most people grow garlic just for the cloves and the bulbs, right? There\u2019s more to the garlic plant than just\nthe cloves or bulbs, and I think it\u2019s quite sad that people are fixated on the garlic\ncloves, right? You could actually eat the whole plant so\nyou know before you guys dry these you know pick off some nice leaves right here, right? You could just chop these up finely add them\nto salads, add them to soups, add them to your different recipes, use them just like\nyou would chives. Now I understand this right. These guys are little bit strong the garlic\ngreens can be a bit strong but if you like garlic, you\u2019re Italian, more power to ya,\nalright? The other thing and you could eat these leaves\nthe whole season. Now I wouldn\u2019t go around and harvest a ton\nof the leaves of the garlic during the season. I would go maybe around each plant and harvest\nlike one leaf off each plant, one leaf the plant\u2019s not gonna miss. But if you over-harvest the leaves of course\nyour bulbs are not gonna forma as big. The thing though l want to let you guys know\nabout is that these stalks here, you know, that are pretty thick, even though these are\nthick and fibrous, right? They\u2019re still edible you can still use them\nand eat them and actually they\u2019ve a lot of juice in there. If I just take this in my mouth and chew. Alright. I definitely got some garlic breath and that\u2019s\ngonna ward off the vampires. So yeah you can juice these stalks you can\nalso cut them up. I would dice them into small pieces add them\nto soups or things for flavoring. They are a little bit fibrous so you want\nthem to break down if you are gonna eat them. But they have a lot of good flavor in them\nso don\u2019t forget about them and you can actually cut some of these guys before drying them\nand actually have them for your benefit and use them. I\u2019ll probably cut off a few of these and\nactually, you know, run it through my juicer and get kind of a nice garlic flavor in some\nof my juices. So yeah be aware of that cause not many people\nteach you about that part of this. So anyways let\u2019s go ahead and hang up this\ngarlic. Not super rocket science. We\u2019re just gonna go ahead and take it and\nyou know turn this around up here. Make sure you keep tension on your rope, super\ncritical, super important. And I\u2019m just gonna go ahead and put it in\nhere, and put in a fancy slipknot that I never learned about because I was never in the Boy\nScouts or nothing like that. But let\u2019s see if Boy Scout guy that wasn\u2019t\nin the Boy Scouts could tie a knot that\u2019s gonna hold my garlic up. Alright now I wouldn\u2019t do this if I was\nlike rock climbing. But I think to hold some garlic up I think\nI\u2019ll be find. Alright so we got that garlic tied up there,\nnow I just gotta do a bunch more bunches and get them all hung then I\u2019ll be back at you\nwith my final thoughts and comments about harvest using and eating the garlic. Alright so as you guys can see I got all my\ngarlic hanging here in my nice shaded greenhouse. And the thing is how long do you let your\ngarlic hang for? That\u2019s a good question. Depends on where you live. I mean, here probably a week and a half. In 80 plus to 100 degree weather, you know,\nthis stuff\u2019s going to be dry and I live in an arid climate. If you live in Vermont or something it might\ntake three weeks. You know, it also depends on how much air\ncirculation and the humidity level in the air. But basically you just wanna check for and\nmake sure that all the roots are all fully dried out, they\u2019re looking pretty good and\nthen at that point you can take them all out and you know cut off some of the greenery\non the top, compost that, and then you gotta store your garlic inside. And you know I have my garlic store probably\nat six to nine months depending on the variety. So you know just in by growing enough garlic\nin one or two raised beds I have enough garlic to meet my dietary requirements for the entire\nyear. And so that I don\u2019t have to buy any garlic. And you know life is not an all or nothing\ngame. I would encourage you guys to grow as much\nfood as you possibly can and to display certain items you know garlic is something really\neasy to grow and as I\u2019ve mentioned before you know. My intention with the raised bed that I grew\nin wasn\u2019t to grow garlic. My intention was to grow spinach. But I put garlic in between the spinach plants\nto get a secondary crop also because the garlic helps repel some of the pests that might normally\ngo on the spinach due to the you know the high garlic smell and the essential oils in\nthere. And so I always wanna encourage you guys to\ndo good better best. Grow some garlic, you could even grow garlic\ninside a container than might not ever make nice bulbs but hey you\u2019ll always have the\ngreens to eat so you can get that garlic flavors into. Now the last thing I wanna say is I do not\nwanna recommend or encourage you guys purchasing conventional garlic to grow your garlic from\nin your garden. And the reason is why? Most of the garlic that\u2019s sold in the stores\nthat\u2019s conventional but is not organic is imported from China. That\u2019s part of the majority of it these\ndays unless you\u2019re lucky enough to live in California, then you might get California\ngarlic. But even in California I\u2019ve seen lots of\nplaces sell the cheap low quality Chinese garlic. We don\u2019t know if that\u2019s irradiated, we\ndon\u2019t know what kind of treatments, chemicals they\u2019re doing to it. So I\u2019d encourage you guys to start off with\nsome cloves from a good local source. You know, visit your local farmer\u2019s market\nand buy some garlic from a good local farmer. Also when you do that you\u2019re gonna have\nsome varieties that perform well in your specific climate zone. I know the red inchelium garlic is a variety\nthat does really good here in the climate zone that I\u2019m at. Oh and then if you don\u2019t have a farmer\u2019s\nmarket to go to hey buy some organic garlic. You know, by law that\u2019s stuff is not supposed\nto be irradiated and it\u2019s probably going to be pretty good stuff although sometimes\nit\u2019s from California, sometimes it can be imported, but I haven\u2019t seen imported organic\nChinese garlic. I\u2019ve seen it maybe from like Peru and some\nother places in South America. So yeah, garlic is a fun and rewarding crop\nalso the health benefits of garlic are out of this world. They contain aliinase that\u2019s, you know,\nanti-cancer, gonna help you fight disease. And the only thing it\u2019s gonna do is it might\nprevent your lovers from wanting to kiss ya, unless they\u2019re Italian too.

Now if I had to pick just one\nvegetable I couldn't be without, it would have to be garlic. An unusual choice you might think, but to me its rich satisfying taste is just pure indulgence. Luckily for fellow garlic enthusiasts, growing these flavorsome delights couldn't be any simpler. In this video, we'll show you how to plant, grow and\nharvest these beautiful bulbs. There are two types of garlic - 'hardneck' or 'softneck'. Hardneck varieties produce flower stems or 'scapes' which must be removed to encourage the bulbs to reach their full potential. The scapes themselves are an early summer treat, delicious chopped into salads,\nor stir-fried for a taste of the bulbs to come. Hardneck varieties more tolerant of cold weather \nthan softneck ones, so opt for these of your winters are harsh. While not a true garlic, the enormous\n'Elephant' garlic behaves like a hardneck type. Despite its size, it has quite a mild flavor. Softneck varieties don't produce scapes\nbut store for much longer, so pick a softneck garlic if you\nwant plenty of bulbs to keep over winter. Always buy your seed from a reputable\nplant nursery or online supplier. Garlic from the grocery store may carry disease\nand could be unsuitable for your climate. Originating from Central Asia, garlic\nloves a sunny location in fertile, well-draining soil. You can improve your soil\nby digging in plenty of well-rotted organic matter such as garden compost a few months before planting. Unlike many vegetables, garlic is usually\nplanted in autumn. This is because the winter cold signals it to begin bulb\nproduction the following spring. To find out when you can plant in your area, take\na look at our Garden Planner. Add garlic to your plan, then refer to the\naccompanying Plant List to see when to plant it and when you can expect to\nenjoy your harvest. Plant your garlic into prepared soil raked to a fine tilth. Begin planting by carefully breaking apart the bulb to separate out the individual cloves. Plant them pointy end up about 6in (15cm) apart, leaving a foot (30cm) between rows . You can make a trench or dig a hole for each clove. Cover them back over with soil so that \nthe tips of the cloves are only just below the surface. If birds pull up the cloves, replant them and pop a row cover or netting over the top \nto prevent further problems. In very cold regions, garlic cloves can be planted\ninto module trays for planting out in spring. Fill the trays with general-purpose potting soil and \nplant one clove per module in exactly the same way. You can also grow garlic in containers. Choose pots that are at least 8in (20cm) wide,\nwith adequate drainage holes at the base. Plant the cloves so they are 4-6in (10-15cm)\napart in each direction. Cover them with more potting soil, then move to a sunny\nspot. Container garlic will need watering in dry weather to encourage steady growth. Garlic needs very little attention. Water if the weather is dry, and you'll need to weed \nbetween rows to keep plants from getting swamped. Laying an organic mulch such as grass clippings\nduring the growing season will help to feed plants\nwhile keeping the ground cool and moist. Your garlic is ready to lift when the leaves \nhave begun to turn yellow or die down in summer. Use a fork or trowel to ease the bulbs from the ground, then dry them out somewhere warm and airy. Once dry, brush off any remaining soil, cut off the leaves, then store in a cool dry place\non racks for good airflow. Alternatively, weave the leaves into a plait\nlike this to hang up. Garlic bulbs should keep like this for\nthree months or more. And that's it! Growing garlic couldn't be\nany simpler.

(upbeat music) Hey there, I'm London Brazil\nfrom EvolvingTable.com, where you'll learn how\nto make nourishing meals for your loved ones. And today we're doing a quick kitchen tip that will teach you how to roast garlic in the oven two different ways. We'll first start off by preheating our oven to 400 degrees. Next, we'll start preparing the garlic. If you're preparing more\nthan one garlic head, make sure that you find\nsimilarly sized heads of garlic. Also, be sure to check\nthat the garlic heads don't have any brown\nor moldy spots on them. Peel and remove all of the feathery paper from the outside of the head of garlic. And then cut off the top until all of the garlic cloves are exposed. If you do not see all of the cloves, simply trim around the end\nuntil they are all cut. Drizzle each head of garlic with about one tablespoon of olive oil and rub it into all of the cloves. Sprinkle each head of garlic with about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Now that our heads of garlic are prepared, let's move on to the two different ways you can roast them in the oven. The first way is my preferred method. Place the heads of garlic, cut side up, in a loaf pan or muffin pan. Cover the pan with a\npiece of parchment paper and then a piece of aluminum foil. The second way works\ngreat if you don't happen to have a loaf pan or a muffin pan handy. Simply wrap the heads of garlic in a piece of parchment paper and then in a piece of aluminum foil. The parchment paper\ncreates a wonderful barrier between the aluminum foil,\nand the head of garlic. So, none of that heavy metal, leaches into your garlic cloves. Place the wrapped heads\nof garlic onto a sheet pan so any excess oil is caught if it happens to drip out. With both methods, roast the garlic in a 400 degree oven for 40 to 60 minutes or until the garlic cloves\nbegin to caramelize. The longer they roast, the more soft and tender the garlic will get. Let the garlic cool completely, until it is comfortable to the touch. To remove the garlic cloves, use a small spoon or a fork. Place it along the rim of the pocket and pop out that garlic clove. Roasted garlic taste incredible on everything from soups,\nin salad dressings, smeared on a toasted baguette, (crunch) mmmm, or in this roasted garlic\nmashed cauliflower recipe.

(muffled helicopter)", "ZgYUgc5c70Y": "- Garlic is a lovely vegetable to grow because it's actually not too difficult, and it stores very well. So from one summer harvest, you can have food or garlic next year to eat for a long time. In fact I've got a bulb here that I harvested exactly a year ago, and it's been hanging in the\nconservatory of my house there, which is a very good place to store garlic 'cause it just wants to be dry basically, indoor atmosphere is nice. And oh, this is nice, except I'm feeling just\none little soft bit. That's not bad for a year old. So one year earlier, that\none was looking like this. In fact, there's two\ndifferent, not exactly types, but different harvests here. There's an outdoor and an indoor. And I grew... I found that growing\ngarlic outdoors in the UK at the moment, for whatever\nreason, I don't know, actually, it's getting a lot of rust. And rust, you can still see a bit. We've taken off most of it, you see here. On these leaves, it makes the leaves go yellow prematurely. You actually first see\nlittle orange spots. And then they develop and basically stop the\nleaf photosynthesizing. So, this is outdoor garlic, which was harvested six days ago on the 18th of June, which in our climate and latitude is a little bit early. Normally I reckon about today, actually, 24th, 26th of June, when all being well, the leaves would still be green. This is a very important\npart of our garlic harvest. Some people say they should yellow. That's not true. Don't believe that one. You should still be seeing, roughly half the leaves at least green. But what you're looking\nfor, and you can check this, just sort of burrow down into\nthe ground with your hand, or use a trowel, whatever. And feel around the bulb, and you should be feeling protrusions where the cloves are forming. And these are a little bit\nimmature because of the rust. I mean there's a not any bigger, but slightly more mature one. And you can see the clove\nstarting to prick up. If I just peel off the outer skin a bit, you can probably see more clearly. The outer skin was white\nat the time of harvest, and interestingly, it's now gone purple. Do you see the nice clove there? So this garlic is 90% mature, I would say, and it's fine to store. It will keep really well. It's still maturing. And we leave as much of\nthe top on as it's healthy, while it's maturing, that will help it to finish off ripening. And you can the difference between, so this is the outdoor\ngarlic, planted, sown, as in sown cloves at\nthe same time as this. So that's pretty much average difference between growing under cover, where not only, it's a bit\nwarmer in the growing time, which is between October and June. But also, I find at\nthe moment, undercover. That means greenhouse or polytunnel. It doesn't get rust. And so it stays green to the end. And it still quite green\nleaves at harvest time. And because it's been\nphotosynthesizing fully, we get lovely big bulbs. I'm really, I'm so happy with those. And this is softneck. So it's important to\nunderstand the difference. Softneck, you can do that. Hardneck, you can't. We'll look at that in a minute. And it's the two main\ntypes, softneck, hardneck. This one, harvest earlier. That's probably the main\npoint of difference. Sow them at the same time, look after them in the\nsame way, same spacing. But the harvest of softnecks, two to three weeks earlier, which is why the hard necks\nare still in the ground, and the hard necks tend to have, they tend to be slightly\nsmaller, and with fewer cloves. But they're bigger therefore. So, depends what you want. They're easiest to peel, actually, that's quite an attribute. And I'm gonna take this one, and do a pretend plant with it over there, where we're gonna have a\nlook at hardneck garlic. Here by contrast, is the hardneck garlic. And you can see the difference there by these stems that come out, which is potentially a flaring stem. It has the little pagoda on the top, where the flower would\nform if it was allowed to. These are two of three\nthat we missed actually, that you harvest these normally, as they're called scapes,\nwhich you can eat. And that would be sometime\nlate May, early June, in our situation here. Because that then encourages\nthe garlic bulb to form, all being well. So you can see also here. I should show this before\nI take it out, the rust. That would be a green leaf, still, if it wasn't for this rust, which is those orange spots. You see them first on the\nunderside of the leaf. And I'm sorry I can't offer\nyou any remedy for it. It's very similar to leek rust, but actually quite a lot worse, and growing worse as well, sadly. Nonetheless, I think we're gonna find, by the thickness of the stem, a decent size bulb. And although I could leave\nthis a bit longer here, because it hasn't got any leaves anymore. It's just as well to harvest it. And also with garlic, if you\nleave in the ground too long, it starts to rot a bit on the outside, and you can lose the\nouter skin of the bulb, and then the cloves all are exposed. And sure enough, you can see\nthis is quite a bit smaller than the softnecks we\nwere looking at there. Also, smaller than I should be, because of the rust. So if I just cut the, I find it good to cut the\nroots off at this stage, just 'cause they cut\nmore easily when damp. And then I'm gonna peel\noff the outer skin. Again, good to do at harvest\ntime, because then... Well it's just a lot easier. And you've got this beautiful white bulb, where I am seeing some\nclove differentiation. So although the rest has\ncaused quite a bit of damage, all is not lost. There's still quite a bit\nof worthwhile garlic there, which we'll leave to dry. You can leave it to dry in the sun, but when it's really hot\nlike this at the moment and very strong sun, that's what makes the\nbulbs go a bit purple. And too much of that can\ncause some deterioration in the flesh of the garlic. So we actually leave them in the sun for a couple of days, maybe, and then put them under\ncover with some air around to finish drying for about four weeks, until the tops are really quite dry, and then that's when we\nhang them up under cover. And then planting, you can see the spacing here. It's around 10 centimeters, four inches. The rows are 30 to 35\ncentimeters, 12, 14 inches apart. It's pretty close. So we had softneck there, had quite a lot of garlic\nfrom this fairly small area. And the way we plant this, very simple, just dib a hole. I use a dibber, because that's so easy to make a hole in the\nsoft surface compost. No dig. And then you take, I always recommend to take the best bulbs from the year before. Do bear with me here, 'cause we're June, this\nis a fake planting. It's not a real planting. This is what you want to in October. So if I wanted to grow\nthis hardneck garlic, I'd let it dry and then\ntake the bulb apart into cloves in October. It's not written it stone\nit has to be October. That's an average. From mid-September to\nChristmas is possible. Earlier in that period,\nyou tend to get more yield. So select the biggest cloves, and you put in the same way up that they were growing already, so that's the bottom\nend and the rooting end, into the ground. Cover over. And that's garlic planted,\nshould it be October. And in fact, what we do\nis put them not too deep, maybe that much ground above them. And then the annual surface dressing of compost on the bed. In October, it just works really well. So that was this bed was\ncomposted last October. It's received one or two\nother bits involved it in, just 'cause we wanted to lose a bit. But basically, that's the\nessence of it, the simplicity, and I find with not\nweeding, it's not an issue, because they don't actually grow much. And just to finish this off, I think it'll be fun to look at a variation of garlic,\nwhich is elephant garlic. The last we're looking at\nhere is a slightly crazy one. It's called elephant garlic, which I feel is the wrong name, actually. It's because the flavor\nis very, very mild. And I think of it now as bulb leek. You can see how the plants\nlook quite leek-like, and look our sulfur rust. Not the same rust anyway to see on garlic. And the unusual thing, so I'm rather leaping ahead of myself. Not often I use a spade on these videos. But like I've had to\nrummage around this clump, and it's so strongly rooted. I think the simplest method to remove it, would be just to cut underneath\na bit with this spade. It's very sharp, copper spade. And the reason, there's\nlot of stems coming out of this clump. You would normally have say, one, 'cause you plant one\nelephant garlic clove, and you get one bulb. But, I'll be perfectly honest with you. I forgot to harvest this last autumn, or last summer rather. And so there was a lot of\nelephant garlic cloves in here, making lots of bulbs. And I'm pretty curious to see, actually, what has happened in the way of harvest. We're gonna see quite a\nrange of shapes and sizes, and it's looking like quite a lot of them are gonna be quite big. Perhaps if I just stop\nlevering at the point, but as this one's coming out already. That's another curiosity\nabout elephant garlic, and I'm sure some of you\nwill know better than me, the little bulbils that\nform on the outside of it. But whatever, you can see\nwhat a wonderful specimen of garlic it is. So that's just one of\nthe few growing here. There's another one. Here's probably the biggest one. Actually, they're very shallow. So doing that little bit\nof levering with the spade has worked to release them all. All right, look at this. Wow. You can see they're growing in a corner, very near to this clump of asparagus. And also something called Good-king-Henry or Lincolnshire spinach. So they haven't had it all their own way, but they're doing all right. There's one slightly, yeah. If you pull too hard and\ndon't lever a little bit, or cut underneath then, you can lose the stem,\nand they won't keep. They'd still be good to\neat if they break off, but not to store. These will keep pretty well\nfor a decent length of time, like until next spring or even longer. Same story if you keep them dry, there are every so many bulbils here, and a little bit through\nto see what happens. Both of them growing on... I'm just going to nip around this actually for this last one, because I don't want to cut into the asparagus roots too much. Aw then, look at this. This is magnificent. So if you expect that to taste of garlic, you will be disappointed. It is more leek. And it has not many of really big cloves. And you can see also how, I'm have see at a time, when still quite a bit of green leaf. But look how mature it is. It would have stood for\nanother couple of weeks. So there's quite a long, harvest window from now until the middle\nof July, in this case. And I'll treat them after this, the same. And they have same\nproperties of all garlic, which is that once you've got the harvest, you've also got your seed. That's something I really like about it. The softneck that I was harvesting, I last bought the main\nlot seed, 16 years ago. So I've just keep going, replanting bulbs from that same stock. So it's very economical. Crops are grown not too difficult. I do recommend the no-dig approach, 'cause weeding can be an issue otherwise. They don't offer much weed competition with garlic, itself. And you should find it\nactually pretty simple. (light gentle music)"}
