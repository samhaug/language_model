Today's white chocolate chip cookies are like an inside-out version of classic chocolate chip cookies. These are so good especially if you love a good, soft,\nchocolate cookie. Now this recipe is really simple. There's no mixer required,\nand that's mostly because we're starting with melted butter. You're going to need\n1 cup, or 2 sticks, of melted butter, and this should be unsalted butter. You'll\nwant to melt it in your microwave and then let it cool for about 10 to 15\nminutes before adding any other ingredients. If you add any sugar while\nthis is still too hot you can actually end up melting your sugar and you'll\nhave a runny cookie dough on your hands. Now my butter has already been cooling\nfor about 15 minutes so I can go ahead and add my sugars. We're going to start with 1 and 1/4 cups of tightly packed light brown sugar. And just a 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. Stir together your butter and your sugars until everything\nis completely combined. Now we can add our eggs. You're going to need 1 large\negg, plus 1 egg yolk. Just the yolk for that second one. We're adding this extra yolk because it helps make the cookies tender, and soft, and chewy. We'll also stir in 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract. Now set your wet ingredients aside, and in a separate bowl you're going to need 2 and 1/4 cups of\nall-purpose flour. Add 1/2 cup of natural cocoa powder. 2 teaspoons of cornstarch. 1\nteaspoon of baking powder. 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.\nNow stir everything together until your dry ingredients are completely combined and your cocoa powder is really well integrated into the flour mixture. Now we'll gradually add our dry ingredients into our wet ingredients until the dough is completely combined. Now we can add our chocolate chips. You\nare going to need a total of 2 cups of white chocolate chips. Now only one and a\nhalf cups is going to go into the batter now. We're going to reserve that other\n1/2 cup for later on when they come out of the oven. We're going to press them on\ntop the cookies. I'll show you that in a bit. Now our cookie dough is going to need to chill in the refrigerator for at least 30\nminutes before we can bake it. So I'm just gonna cover this with cling wrap\nand transfer it to the fridge. When your cookie dough has just about finished\nchilling you can go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Once\nit's finished chilling we can go ahead and scoop it and bake it. I'm using a 1\nand 1/2 tablespoon size cookie scoop here, and for a round uniform looking\ncookies, I'm gonna go ahead and just roll the cookie dough between my palms so\nthat it forms a nice uniform ball. These cookies are going to spread as they bake\nso make sure you space them at least 2 inches apart. Alright we can transfer\nour cookies now to our 350 degree Fahrenheit preheated oven where they\nwill need to bake for about 10 to 11 minutes. Now once your cookies have\nfinished baking, remember how we reserved that 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips,\nnow we are going to take these and within one minute of your cookies coming out of the oven I'm just going to gently nestle a few chocolate chips on top. Now this step is optional. If you don't want to do this, you can just toss this 1/2\ncup of white chocolate chips in with the rest of your dough, and stir it in that\nway, but this really makes the white chocolate chips pop. It looks a lot better this way. And that is how you make white chocolate chip cookies from scratch. I really hope you guys enjoyed today's recipe, and if you try this one\nout, please let me know what you think. Thank you so much for watching and I'll\nsee you next time.

recipe so you know that's a good one but today i'm going to be sharing my white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie that i'm going to amp it up a little bit so it's even better than the usual hit that like button and we'll go ahead and get started so in my last video i gave you guys a lot of tips and tricks on ways to make it really perfect so today we're gonna do the same we're gonna start with half a cup of butter now the last video i melted it in a saucepan and i browned the butter and you can definitely do that too but just for the sake of versatility here i'm going to use regular plain old melted unsalted butter i'm gonna add half a cup into my bowl then i'm gonna add our two sugars i'm using equal amounts of brown sugar which is half a cup and white sugar so if you guys wanted a more crispy thin cookie you'll use more white sugar and if you want it like a chewy um chewy soft cookie you'll use more brown sugar since i like the balance of the two with a crispy outer edge and a soft chewy center i'm using the same ratio of both give it a good mix mix mix mix [Music] so during this process i'm making sure that the sugars are completely covered with the butter it's nice and moist mixed in there's no spots like there's no little spots of sugars that's left over you want to make sure that everything is thoroughly combined if you have a hand mixer you can totally use that too and just mix it for like a minute or two this looks good and now i'm gonna add in one egg at room temperature i'm using a large egg here so that's what i recommend and again just mix mix mix you want to mix it until it's like a nice lava-like consistency [Music] and with your spatula the more that you mix it up and the more air that you add to it the lighter that you'll notice the batter gets and i'm looking for kind of light almost like butterscotch color and for it to be lava-like like this okay this looks great all right so now i'm gonna add in our leavening i have half a teaspoon of baking soda i'm just gonna add it directly into the batter and then with my vanilla extract i have one teaspoon here i'm gonna pour it directly over the baking soda so that it activates and then we're going to mix it in real quick half a teaspoon of salt i'm using kosher salt here and then this is not typical of chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies but i promise you adding just a tiny bit of cinnamon ground cinnamon just heightens all of the flavor and just rounds it out beautifully you're not going to taste too much of the cinnamon because i'm only adding like an eighth an eighth of a teaspoon but that tiny little bit makes such a huge difference now i'm just gonna give it a good mix okay we have our lemonade our salt our flavorings all in the butter mixture and now we add our flour so the flour this is a really important step because so many of you guys have dm'd me or messaged me saying that your cookies are either too um flat or they have stayed really stiff and i think the problem is that we usually when we scoop our flour we don't level it off so i really wanted to make sure that you guys do that for the sugar as well but for the flour it's really important i know i'm using cups today but a lot of you guys have requested that i translate it into metrics so i'm gonna leave the recipe translated and everything in the description box below but for our flour since i am using cups here what i'm gonna do is scoop tap it so that any of the like holes get settled down so you're not having any air pockets in there and then with something flat i'm just gonna scrape up the top so it's nice and even like that so we're gonna add one and a half cups and now i'm gonna add our white chocolate i have about one and a quarter cups here and some chopped macadamia nuts so the macadamia nuts i'm using are roasted salted does it affect the flavor of the whole batter yeah it's going to i find white chocolate to be really sweet so i prefer the salted version to kind of just neutralize the sweetness however if you want to keep the sweetness level um go ahead and just take down the amount of salt that you add and it should be pretty balanced i'm going to add this in as well and just give it a final mix [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay this is looking good it's all mixed in you don't want to see any kind of powdering of flour or anything left at the end make sure it's thoroughly mixed and now we're ready to scoop it out onto our baking sheet so now with my cookie scoop i'm just going to scoop the batter right onto my cookie sheet lined with some parchment paper that way it doesn't stick so for the scoop i just get a nice mound no need to really roll it into a ball or anything it'll pretty much keep its shape so if you can tell from the scoop here we have a nice batter to mix in ratio you get a lot of white chocolate and nuts in there in every single bite so depending on the size of your scoops and how big your cookies are this will make anywhere from 18 to 24 cookies and sometimes it gets stuck like this but just pull it out and just press it into the batter the cookie dough and you're golden okay this looks perfection now you guys have two choices if you like your cookies a little more tall go ahead and put it into the fridge for about 10 minutes to let the dough chill and just kind of melt together as you're preheating the oven if you don't really care that it kind of falls flat a little bit you can go ahead and pop it into the oven right now at 350 degrees for anywhere from eight to ten minutes until it's nice and golden brown i lean on the i really care it just tastes good inside so i'm gonna pop it in here we go these look perfect they look so beautiful and they smell incredible now i just have to let them cool down for about five minutes and then we're gonna dig in all right it's ready but first let's talk about how it looked and how it settled after it's cooled down as you can see it's not totally flat we have enough mix-ins and leavening in there so that it really holds its shape but inside you'll see that it's nice and soft so let me go ahead and break it open oh wait but first i also want to mention that it has just like the most beautiful golden brown color so i kept this in the oven for about eight and a half minutes my oven tends to run maybe like five to ten degrees hotter so i always just have to keep an eye on it towards the end but if yours runs cooler leave it on until it pretty much looks like this so let's break it open still soft in the inside and if you guys think it looks too wet trust me on this when it cools down completely it will turn into the most soft chewy beautiful cookie dough trust me just go read the comments on the perfect chocolate chip cookie video and you guys will believe but basically the inside is soft and chewy and the outside is nice and crispy which is just how i like it let's give it a try i'm not usually a white chocolate chip fan but this cookie is so delicious that i am a fan now if you guys don't want nuts in your cookies you can always swap it out for some dried cranberries especially for the holiday season to make it nice and festive the white chocolate is very sweet not gonna lie but it's very balanced with the salted roasted macadamia nuts and then because we added that little hint of cinnamon in there it just like like i said rounds it out and gives it more interest if you guys decided to brown the butter that will add another layer of complexity to this that just takes it to a whole other level if you guys do try to make this

com the link is below in the description and it's gonna be the top comment now we can go ahead and put those dry ingredients aside and work on creaming our brown sugar our white sugar and our butter together I'm using a stand mixer you can also use a hand mixer in a large bowl and I'm just gonna cream that together for about a minute or so next I'm gonna add my two eggs one at a time making sure that each one is well mixed before adding the next and then I'm gonna follow that up with some pure vanilla extract about two teaspoons and then be sure and stop and scrape your bowl down whether you're using a stand mixer or a hand mixer after you scrape your bowl down go ahead and start adding your dry mixture I do have the mixer on low while I'm doing this I just don't want flour everywhere as soon as the cookie dough comes together stop the mixer now definitely you can fold the chocolate chips in by hand but what I like to do since I already stopped the mixer is just to quickly add them in and as soon as they get mixed in stop the mixer again you don't want to get too comfortable overworking this dough it comes together really easily and quickly just like that and then I'm just gonna use a regular little cookie scoop to scoop out each cookie and I also like to put a little extra chips right on the top so when they bake those are sitting right up top where you can see them we're gonna bake these at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 to 22 minutes and there they are they are nice and chewy 22 minutes actually keeps the cookie chewy even the next day and you store it in an

our unsalted butter light brown sugar granulated sugar and our vanilla extract and we're going to cream that on medium speed about 2 to 3 minutes until it's light and fluffy now in between the mixing you want to make sure you stop and scrape down the sides of your boat just to make sure everything is combined okay so we're gonna go with our eggs one at a time you want to make sure that first egg is well mixed in before you go into your second one [Music] okay so we're stepping down our ball again and next we're gonna go with our flower adding in one cup at a time [Music] all right so I'm gonna scrape down my bone once again and I'm going to gently fold in my white chocolate chips and the sprinkles I ended up using them back and a half of the white chocolate chips in the entire bottom of the sprinkles but you can certainly use listen if you like [Music] okay so this recipe makes about three dozen cookies so I use the large size cookie scoop and I only baked six because they were so big so I'll grease my hands really well roll them into a nice sized ball place them on a greased cookie sheet about two to three inches apart and bake them on 375 for eight to nine minutes now I froze the rest of the dough so if you want to know if you can freeze it you certainly can all right these are eight fresh out of the oven I just place them on a cookie rack a little cool about ten to

those so good I had to take the bite so we're gonna start with a large mixing bowl with one cup of white granulated sugar 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and two sticks of room-temperature softened butter we're going to cream the sugar which means blend in the softened butter and you want to make sure that it is soft because this is ridiculously hard to do with butter sticks straight out of the fridge and once you have it looking something like this we can add in our wet ingredients which are 1 and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons of and one egg mix this together until you get a consistency of a thin toothpaste something like this we can now add one cup of all-purpose flour 1 and 1/4 teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of baking soda baking soda not baking powder baking soda and once that's mixed together pretty well and add another cup of all-purpose flour mix that together and then we'll add a quarter cup of all-purpose flour I find it easier to mix if I add it in stages instead of two and a quarter cups all at once and once we have it mixed together and we get something like this we can add our chocolate chips for this video I'm getting a little fancy and add one cup of white chocolate chips and one cup of milk chocolate chips blend that together until you're confident that you will get some chocolate chips and a scoop and here I'm using a melon baller and bake in a 375-degree oven for about 12 minutes you'll want to check them at 10:00 to see how they're doing and there you have it our chocolate chip cookies with milk chocolate and white chocolate chips check

[Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you", "cq2bfZuPHhA": "today I'm going to be making something really really yummy and these are my double chocolate white chocolate chip cookies and here the ingredients that we need 3/4 of a cup of cocoa powder 2 cups of all-purpose flour 2 eggs 1 cup of brown sugar one cup of white chocolate chips this is 225 grams 1 cup of unsalted butter 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt a recipe note if you are using salted butter simply remove the salt from my recipe so those are the ingredients so let's get started for our first step I'm going to get all of our nice butter into a large bowl okay that's good to that my white granulated sugar and our brown sugar so I'm just going to break that up a little bit with a fork and whenever you're measuring out your brown sugar you want to pack it tightly into your measuring cup so as you're pushing it into your cup push it down so that it gets really really nice and compact like you see here okay that's good then I'm going to grab my mixer and we're going to start creaming this together once you see that the whole mixture is starting to come together we can add a little bit of moisture a lot in my first day and that will really help with the creaming process as soon as that extra moisture gets into the actual sugars everything starts to really come together as you see here then we'll add in our second egg and then I'll add in my vanilla and I'm using pure vanilla extract in this recipe if you can find pure always use pure it's really really much nicer than the artificial stuff all that in my salt and then we'll sift in our dry ingredients so we'll get our lovely cocoa powder in there and all of our flour and our baking soda grab the back of a spoon and I'll just push this through if you're only using flour you can take your hand and go like this but if you are using cocoa powder it's good to use the back of a spoon because otherwise you're going to get your hands dirty we'll grab our mixer speed number one I'm just going to slowly start incorporating all of the dry ingredients into our wet so we're about halfway there another minute or so and we should be done okay so this is about a minute later and it's all nicely mixed so for our last thing we're going to take our chocolate chips and I'm just going to get those in there and what I did was I opened up the package and I took a few out and we're going to keep these out to put on top of our actual cookies just before they go into the oven and now I'll just mix these in quickly okay that's perfect so we're all set to go I have my cookie sheet here and a piece of parchment paper this is optional you can go directly onto your cookie sheet if you wish but I'm going to use parchment today I've got myself a medium sized scoop and you can do this by eye just with a spoon but I'm just going to go and use my scoop today it's all do you got some rho3 oh and this dough smells really really good so I'll whip through these and I'll be back in one second okay once that is done now we have the little chips that I had leftover and you can just take these and just put them on the top do three or four doesn't really matter you could put a lot more you could also take a fork and push all of these down if you wanted to I'm not going to I'm just going to get them in like that so I'll just keep going at this be back in a second okay by putting these on the top it really illustrates what kind of cookie it is it's nice to have a cookie that looks good if you ever go into the little cookie shops you'll notice that if you look really carefully at a cookie you'll see that some of these have been placed on the top just before they go in that's just to promote the cookie you want to make the cookie look as appetizing as possible because they are in the business of selling cookies so there we go so I'm going to pop this into my 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes so what I think I'm going to do there's a lot of dough here I am going to bake off all of these and then I'm going to come back when they're completely done so my first batch is done and is cooling now I did those for 10 minutes the second batch I'm going to show you something slightly different I'm just going to take my fork and I'm just going to press a little bit onto each one just to give each cookie a little bit more surface area for the oven heat to warm up so that looks good one left and then I'm going to put on the chocolate chips and pop these into the oven for the same amount of time ten minutes so I'll do that and then I'm going to actually really come back when all of them are done all right so I'm back I have cleaned up and I have all my beautifully baked cookies and I have a total of 44 cookies out of this batch I just wanted to show you an overall view first so these are the first ones that we did these are the ones that I did not press with the fork I just scooped them out and we put the chocolate on top then this row here and this row are the ones that we push down with the fork and then what I did was for a third option I use the back of a spoon and push down the all these cookies here except these too so we have all of these were pushed down with the back of the spoon and these two are some of the originals as well and now that you've seen all of them I'm just going to zoom in a little bit on some of these just to show you a little closer up so I've just zoomed in just to show you the three different types so these are the original ones these are the ones that I scooped out and I did not push down at all then we have the ones that I scooped out and I used our fork okay those are there and then these ones here are the ones that I used with the back of the spoon and also push those down so there we have the three different types so you have three slightly different looks I actually like this look here and look here this here with the fork is typically what you're going to see on a peanut butter cookie so I don't really like it that much on the chocolate but you can do either way all three of them are nice and all of these were baked for the same time ten minutes in my 350 degree oven and the last thing let's break into one of these and I'll just show you how nice these are look at this these are completely cooled by the way and look really really nice and moist nice and chewy if you want them a little bit more firm you want to go about 12 minutes but look at that mmm really really good mmm I love these so that's it for today's video if you enjoyed it please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that so that's it for today and I'll see you next time you",

"PwvSxX9E2ms": "- [Lainey] Hello, guys,\nwelcome back to Cookie Mondays. Today we'll be making no\nbake cookie dough bites, which is a great recipe\nto use during the summer when you don't wanna turn on your oven. Let's begin! You're going to need 1/2 a cup of butter, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1/3 cup of granulated sugar,\nand then take your beater, and you're going to cream it\nuntil it's light and fluffy. (gentle, cheerful music) And after about 30 seconds, everything should be mixed in very well. Then you're going to add one\nteaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and one cup of all-purpose flour. And then you're going to continue mixing until everything is well combined. And then grab 3/4 cups\nof mini chocolate chips. Mini chocolate chips work best because it's easier to bite into, rather than the regular chocolate chips. And you're just going to mix it until everything is\ncombined, just like so. Then I grabbed about a\ntablespoon of the cookie dough, and then I just kinda smashed it together and rolled it into a ball. Then I placed it onto parchment paper. The cookie dough tastes so much better when it's refrigerated, so let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes\nin the refrigerator, Make sure you cover it\nso it doesn't dry out. A really easy recipe to make,\nand it's great for summer, because you don't have\nto turn on the oven. So what kind of cookie do you wanna see on the next Cookie Monday, Bear cookies, button cookies,\nor ice cream cookies? Let me know by commenting on the bottom. Bye, guys!

thank you our deepest smells like chocolate chip it looks like a chocolate chip cookie like very classic this feels good this feels like it should I wanted to be a little gooey er but I like the like I like the weight this is a weighty cookie breaks apart really beautifully it's very um feels under baked there's there's chocolate and everybody firm on the outside gooey on the inside that's really important in a cookie but my hands are like a little oily which I don't really like that much it's not my favorite I'm gonna be honest with you I like a more crispy crispy cookie up next is Snoop Dogg he starts by combining flour baking soda and salt in a bowl and mixing it up until combined set that aside bring in another bowl and add butter and peanut butter white sugar brown sugar and beat that up with a hand mixer until nice and fluffy scrape that down and add one egg and vanilla extract and mix it up one more time just until combined bring back your dry ingredients add those and slowly mix that in fold in your chocolate chips and scoop it into balls onto a baking sheet uses a tablespoon so these are a bit smaller than Martha's pop them in the oven and there you have it Snoop Dogg's Rolls Royce peanut butter chocolate chip cookies this cookies a lot later than the first one I can already feel there's enough chocolate in here for me this looks a very Keebler Keebler Elf like soft batch also very soft I it's a little under baked for my taste I'm just gonna say that much peanut butter this cookie has peanut butter in it I hate peanut butter and I know that's a strong take but it is what it is so I'm probably not look at this cookie cutter hop whoo this is not a good cookie experience this is like just falls apart it's not a cookie this is like a granola plop and butter it's good it's good good not great I think I'm like a chocolate chip cookie purist like not my my favorite I wouldn't eat it again but if you like peanut butter I'm sure you'd love this next cookie next up is a recipe by Kourtney Kardashian she starts by combining melted coconut oil palm sugar vanilla extract and pumpkin puree and mix that up until smooth takes a good bit of mixing just to get that melted coconut oil completely incorporated set that aside and in another bowl combine the flour baking soda baking powder cinnamon nutmeg and salt and mix that all together so it's nice and evenly distributed bring back the wet ingredients and add your dry to it mix in half just so it's not too clumpy at first and then mix in the remaining so it's nice and smooth that add dairy free chocolate chips stir that up and the dough is good to go roll them into one tablespoon size balls and place on a baking sheet the dough is a bit greasy so my hands got a little shiny pop them in the oven and there's our cookies this looks like a little nugget it's now the right time to tell you that I'm allergic to this whatever this is I'm allergic to it this is like the dome peanut butter cookie I was talking about cinnamon like I mean this feels to me like it's it's not a cookie like this feels like it's like a salad trying to be a cookie there's not a lot of chocolate but that's fine for me right off the bat I smell cinnamon this might be an oatmeal cookie which is even more disturbing than the actual shape of it these days how they it's just weird I'm gonna try a bite wow this is awful I don't know what's in this cookie all scared there's this everything that was left over that you just put into a bowl and made cookies out of like was that what this was you want a cookie and like this this is not the one who's gonna win your heart I I feel like there's like a vegetable in here if this is what your ideas for a chocolate chip cookie just don't bother like why just eat like a celery stick or something up next is a recipe from Michelle Obama which is actually Sasha and Malia's godmothers recipe but it's Michelle's favorite she starts by combining all-purpose flour baking soda and salt in a bowl and telling the other side in another bowl combine two sticks of butter with Crisco brown sugar and granulated sugar and vanilla extract and using a hand mixer mix that all up until fluffy add two eggs fully mixing them in with the hand mixer before you add the next one scrape that down and to that you're slowly gonna add back your dry ingredients to create a dough little at a time just so it doesn't get chunky to that add chopped walnuts milk chocolate chips mint chocolate candies and white chocolate chips and stir that all up until combined [Music] using around a tablespoon force them into balls and pop em in the oven I'm nice looking normal cookie thank you oh this looks nice see this is getting closer to a cookie I like oh one of these cookies this is like like everything but the kitchen sink cookie it has this kind of laziness it's thin it has a crisp enos to it oh it's like crunchy and flaky I love this is like my ideal cookie not heavy enough oh my god it's peppermint this has meant there's a mint enos coming off of this one I don't that's just me yeah too much stuff not enough cookie there's a lot going on in this cookie but I'm very much about it this is a cookie for people who like love drama I like the cookie part I don't know why it has a mint flavor to it which is not what I want when I'm diving into a chocolate chip cookie this is definitely a holiday cookie it's crazy I want to make this so that I can give to my family last but not least is a recipe from the rock he starts by combining butter granulated sugar and brown sugar in the bowl and using a hand mixer and beating it all together until fluffy to that add vanilla extract and two eggs and beat it one more time until it's combined scrape that down and add flour two and a half cups of oatmeal that's been pulverized into a flour salt baking soda and baking powder and mix that up until a dough forms add chocolate chips chopped walnuts and a grated chocolate bar and mix it up one more time until it's combined looks a little dry but we'll see roll them into balls and pop them in the oven and there you have it the rocks favorite chocolate chip cookies Oh God it's cookies like to perfect it looks delicious and it looks like it's going to be a little soft in the inside but still like crunchy which is what I like it seems like the kind of cookie that would be out for like a open house on an apartment you want to live here because this cookie lives here too this is not what a job chip cookie looks like this is a an abomination of chocolate chip cookies ooh like a little pool there the chocolate it looks pretty well baked nice job Conger on the outside soft on the inside but still like a little crunch it's okay I was suspicions that this is healthy in some way this is a good cookie I changed my mind this is a good cookie I think there's some salt it's not terrible it has a definitely a nutty flavor this is like a very elegant ladies cookie like I think if you brought this to the Upper East Side this would crush it still tastes like a chocolate-chip cookie it's okay another five cookie said I just tried I think that number five is my favorite the reason why is because there's a lot of textures it was a beautiful cookie to look at and it just tasted delicious like I said everything kind of just melted together and it was all like well distributed there at the cookie like I wasn't tasting like a big chunk of something a big chunk of chocolate number one was my favorite hands-down I'm a cookie purist that was the best one it wasn't a salad it wasn't a real estate agent cookie it wasn't a classy lady cookie it wasn't a drama-filled cookie it was pure it was doughy it was intense it was like it was like had density it had depth that had volume it was a it was a good cookie I love cookies can't remember I basically just destroyed all these cookies and there's nothing that remains I think number well the first one probably was my probably the best I guess it's presenting as a chocolate chip cookie and delivering that we're talking about chocolate chip cookies this one is by definition I think closest to that definition the rock Dwayne the rock Johnson have you given you eyebrows and cookies I mean god bless her that does not surprise me oh I'm not surprised I'm not surprised there you have it Martha Stewart has the best chocolate chip cookie recipe what dress we should retest next let us know in the comments call me Martha I love you you never you've never steered me wrong Martha never [Music] you", "46VJ5vz-2q4":

good very good but these were just a little bit more grown up having said that you love these cookies don't you they basically have the same sort of flavor as a chocolate chip cookie obviously but they have a nutty undertone they have a nutty undertone they are baked to perfection a little bit of sea salt on top just makes everything shine and you're going to love them so let me run you through the list of ingredients um you need some unsalted butter that have softened at room temperature so if you want to take this out of the container mia take this out of the wrapper and put it in the bowl we're gonna make this in a standing mixer it's melted it's melting over the bowl go ahead she'll get there don't worry i know these cookies became popular i think a couple years ago and i've seen them many places ever since and i was like you know what i bet that if i just played around with my ultimate chocolate chip cookie dough recipe then i could make them really delicious and it didn't take much they're very similar to that to that recipe and they are so good then we're going to add two kinds of sugar butter and we're going to put it in the machine um and they're going to just sort of combine i'm going to mix them okay we're going to head start mixing it um and we're just going to combine them and we're going to smash i get asked a lot what i do to keep her busy all day and this is one of those things we have been booked baking and cooking a lot over the last year um and she really enjoys it mommy mom at the pizza video i do remember the pizza video and the apple peanut and the apple but yes i know we've done a lot of cooking and i tape her a lot because she loves it and it's something for me mommy i love cooking with you oh my heart i love cooking with you let's try and put it in the machine it's a little hard i know but that's why this is why we have this machine know why because this machine has big strong muscles on the inside and it's going to mix it for us you are so strong and so smart strong smart and kind right push this one right strong smart and kind mommy you're gonna be very good today oh you are very good my love all right i turned it on good we're just gonna let those cream together about a minute or so and then we're gonna add the egg and the tahini crack the egg i know the tahini i'm using is this one which i really really like and i tend to keep a couple of these on hand but really any good tahini will do so i'm just going to let that go in the meantime we're going to let her crack the egg in the small bowl go ahead crack it in here [Music] harder good job good job babe i should have put it right here only chocolate chip well i'm not gonna give you a chocolate chips huh i'm not gonna give you any more chocolate chips mommy you're watching sure let's go wash up all right we're going to add the egg go ahead throw it all in there along with a splash of vanilla it's okay it's all right it wasn't too much i'm gonna wipe it on my apron that's good that's fine okay and then my dress is in the apron your dress is in the apron and then we need about a half a cup of tahini and tahini is nothing more hold on my love hold on then a sesame seed paste you need all of it that is so good mmm and nutty i don't want them bigger i will try it got such good depth of flavor and i love it on pretty much anything i always have let me try a lemon tahini sauce in the fridge a little bit you wanna try a little bit put your finger in it's so good good right delicious okay and now i'm just gonna let these do their thing it's got a little bit of a slight bitter undertone but that's good it's fine it'll be delicious i'm thirsty all right she's like where's my water well she's willing to try and for that i'm going to mix these until they're combined and then we move on to the dry ingredients okay at this point we're going to add dry ingredients flour baking soda and salt it feels good put it in all of it all of it and then the chocolate chips i really like using chocolate chunks for this but it's not the thing that i always have on hand but semi sweet chocolate i'm going to take my trick you're doing great that's a great trick but semi-sweet chocolate chips is something i always have on hand and it just works really really well i actually wouldn't use milk choc chip here because they're a little bit too sweet and you need to offset all of that gooey sweety sweet like nuttiness with some summer sweet now we're just gonna get out of there [Music] you're supposed to have a cup of chocolate chips give or take a quarter cup ouch all right now this does have to go in the fridge for a few hours before you bake them we love these so much right we put the vanilla in fine you put everything in um oh i know i always have a bath while i was gonna get my water yes i always have a batch of this cookie dough ready in the fridge at all times because that's how much we love it no we don't need oil why uh because we already added butter remember it's oily so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna go ahead and take my dough that i already have in the fridge i'm gonna take it out of the fridge let it come to room temperature for like 10-15 minutes preheat my oven at that time at the same time it needs to be preheated to 350 and then we will scoop and we will bake and these are going to be baked today tomorrow morning thank you and anna yeah baby it's from the show is it from hey gabby yeah um and she sings that song what's the other song that you like to sing from that show uh [Music] [Music] one oh okay i'm gonna go pop this in the fridge covered and then we'll get the other stuff out cookie dough came out of the fridge about 10 minutes ago um just so that it can soften a little bit makes it easy to scoop oven is preheated to 350. as per usual sous chef left me she's like you know what i did my job i'm not washing dishes but call me when the cookies are ready so that's fine um i've got a baking sheet with some parchment paper i like to use a large ice cream scoop for this it's the equivalent to three tablespoons you can also use a regular size cookie scoop or whatever but i mean honestly with these ones i feel like go big or go home but also not just because i'm greedy and i like a lot of cookie but they just get a much better texture when they're a little bit bigger you just get a gorgeous like chewy crumbly incredible flavor and texture it's kind of really hard to put in into words but having said that i do make some smaller ones because otherwise sous chef would eat multiple large cookies and i cannot handle the sugar rush okay just can't so i'm just gonna make a few really big ones um and then just because i want you to see them in all of their glory and then i will bake some smaller ones to keep on hand because you know they're cute they're delicious they're kind of like her and everybody loves them so i'm gonna pop them into the oven i like to bake my cookies on my lower third um rack and i'll leave them in there this size will take about 12 minutes smaller size you take about nine to ten minutes so i'll show you what they look like when they're done these babies were in the oven for exactly 12 minutes and they are perfect i like the bottom to be oh look at that they're like they're still warm so they're still very gooey but i want the bottom to be lightly golden i have a small other batch in the oven that are smaller for sous chef and when they come out you want to hit them with just a little bit of sea salt it makes the biggest difference salt in baked goods is the same thing that it does in savory things it just kind of makes the flavor really come out but these are still warm so you have to give them a minute but look at this look at that i mean they are not cakey they are gooey oh chewie they are the best cookies you'll ever eat go to lorry on the kitchen.com get the recipe make them you'll agree with me let me know on ig how much you will love these because you will hopefully enjoy spending time with me and sous chef and we'll see you next time bye you", "xyH5X4KElb8": "[Music] well howdy folks both in the weeds the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are going to be taking a look at another product from hi-5 chocalate we've reviewed two of their products in the past and today we are taking a look at their white chocolate 200 milligram bar I picked this up for 15 bucks at my dispensary so about inline with maybe a little even a little bit cheaper than a 200 milligram a chocolate bar chocolate bars are usually a little bit more expensive but I usually find them to be the best my favorite way to get THC and usually the most effective way you know Kiva's bang's default say all those great ones I found HiFi to be not quite as good as those but to be pretty good the other two that I had reviewed this one is white chocolate white chocolate is not my favorite kind of chocolate in the world I'm not a big big fan of white chocolate but you know I thought I'd give it a review anyways I as I said I like the other to review their dark and milk chocolate so I decided to give the white chalk on a chance you know finish this sweet out here and as I said this is 200 milligrams of THC and on the back we've gotten nutrition information which I always love to see it does not look like unfortunately the lab tests anywhere or if they do they don't let us know where the lab test results are which is unfortunate so you know that's a strike against it but let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste give it a smell all that fun stuff and then of course I will be back in two hours to let you guys know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not so much how it tastes more how it makes you feel okay so uh solvent free distill it distillate distal eight something like that who knows who cares good stuff whoops all right finally got it open here here is our white chocolate with the HiFi logo on it you can see they're divided up into four 50 milligram rectangles let's give let's give it a taste yeah just white chocolate little bit of cannabis taste there at the very end far far from overpowering if you like white chocolate we're gonna like this I think you're like you just fine again an ever so slight cannabis taste to it the chocolate is not as good as kiva or de fauna say but it's it's it's not bad it's not bad white chocolates just not my favorite if you like white chocolate give this a go but guys I'm gonna finish this off eat the last three rectangles here and then I will be back in two hours or for you guys just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I will see you in just a bit besa Arnall here and I are back for the dramatic and exciting conclusion to this sweets review it has been two hours and you're all holding your breath wanting to know if I am high or not just for a second longer I can feel you you want to know so badly any interest I'm pretty high I'm pretty high uh you know I'm not outrageously high this is not a Kiva this is not this is this is about a bang this is about a bang level like one of the bang 180 s or so which is not that's not that's not bad maybe it's not quite as good as a bang Nady but it's good it's good the in the chocolate as I said is is fine and it's a fine price mumbly at like 15 bucks or cheaper I've seen it certainly seen it cheaper than that so I I have good things to say about the hi-fi line III like you duh again it's not my favorite chocolate bar out there I don't think they're trying to be the best chocolate bar on the market but you know in a pinch and they will certainly do and I don't think you're gonna hate yourself if you pick up some hi-fi I don't have anything else interesting to say about it it's good you're gonna like it if you like white chocolate get the white chocolate if you like milk chocolate get the milk chocolate if you like dark chocolate get the dark chocolate that's hi-fi in a nutshell and that is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace that's terrible I didn't even it wasn't even close I mean it wasn't even kind of close no what can you do", "FjgPgPx-J9U": "- White chocolate chips, crunchy macadamia nuts, and a chewy cookie, all in one delicious package. Say hello to my white chocolate\nchip macadamia nut cookie. So delicious and easy too. Hey, you're watching \"Preppy Kitchen,\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cookies will be ready in a snap. So, let's get started. First off, let's add our dry ingredients to a bowl, starting off with one and\na half cups or 180 grams of all purpose flour. In you go. Tap, tap, tap. That was too little, that was too much. That's just right. Okay, set this aside. (bag landing on counter) Now, 1/4 teaspoon of salt. In you go. If you're using salted\nbutter, skip the salt. I'm using unsalted butter, so I have to add salt in. 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda. In you go. We're gonna give us a quick whisk. Whisk, whisk, whisk, and then set it aside. Now, let's get to our\nbutter sugar situation. Set aside. Before I take that mixer out, let's give our macadamia nut a rough chop. I'm using these beautiful whole ones. Gosh, I love macadamia nuts so much. Whenever I have one, I feel like I'm back in Hawaii, which I'm so far away from now. It's the one thing about\nliving on the East Coast. Pop this on to your comically\nsmall chopping board and give them the roughest of chops. I really just want to halve them. I could totally have a couple\nwhole ones in there too. Be very gentle with them. Most of my delicious macadamia\nnuts have been chopped. Not all of them, that's fine. And, I'm just gonna pop them back into my measuring cup for later. Seeing these makes me think\nof like a macadamia nut to like whipped coconut dessert. Mm. I don't know. I want to, like, we might have to like recipe\ntest something for that. So good. In the meantime, let's whip that butter and sugar. We're making cookies today. Now we're gonna add 113\ngrams or half a cup, one stick of unsalted butter into our stand mixer fitted\nwith a paddle attachment. You can definitely do this in a bowl with a hand mixer if you want to. Lock it up, and then just mix it up a bit to get the butter a headstart. (mixer whirring) Now we're gonna add in\n3/4 of a cup or 150 grams of regular old granulated sugar. In you go. Now, mix it up. Mix-a, mix-a, mix-a. We want this to be light\nand fluffy and just nice. Never be afraid to follow your heart or scrape that bowl down. All right, now. (mixer whirring) Let's add one egg in, room temperature, and then a teaspoon of vanilla. (mixer whirring) Now, dump in that flour mixture. In you go. We're gonna mix it up on low until almost combined, almost. (mixer whirring) I don't know why I always\nlook into the bowl like this. Like, tell me a story. It's just mixing. But I'm watching you. Okay. Right now I'm gonna scrape it down, and it might look a little\nbit crumbly right now, because, (beep) I forgot to add my one\nteaspoon of cornstarch. It's gonna make these just hold together a little bit better. That's okay, though. You can forget things. You're a human being. So, if you do that, should've gone with the dry mixture. I'm just gonna tap, tap, tap it in as it mixes up. Tap, tap, tap. There. Nah, it's all fine. It's totally fine now. You can see that my cookie\ndough has come together. That's perfect. But what has to happen now? White chocolate chips, macadamia nut. This is gonna be delicious. You need one cup of white\nchocolate chips for this. I'm gonna weigh that out\nfor everyone at home. 168 grams of white chocolate chips. In you go. Thank you, scale. We're gonna fold most of these in. I'm gonna reserve a small handful. Those'll be stuck on top at the very end. Add in those white chocolate chips and those precious macadamia nuts. You can take a couple\nand reserve them as well. Those'll look nice on top too. Add those in. Use the power of your stand mixer to gently fold these in, just a couple seconds. Fold-a, fold-a, fold-a. Thank you, stand mixer. If you are ever mixing\ncookie dough by hand, do not use a spatula with a wooden handle. It will snap. I've learned this the hard way. You can use a wooden spoon, but not those spatulas. They have really thin\npieces where they join up. Now it's time to chill the dough, give it at least 30 minutes. An hour might be even nicer. In you go. Let's cover it up, let's go. Okay, good morning. I actually let this chill overnight 'cause I had a ton of stuff to do. Those boys need to eat\ndinner on time or else. I'm gonna scoop this dough out now. It's a little bit harder\nthan it might've been if it only chilled for\nan hour or half an hour. That's fine. You can always chill dough overnight. Scoop out roughly two tablespoon size heaping balls of dough, press them together a bit. Give 'em a quick roll. I like to just tamp my cookies down, just a little bit. All right, my first batch is on the baking sheet, but here's the deal. These macadamia nuts were like, really, really, really nice ones. Not salted though, so if you're using a salty macadamia nut, it actually gives you a good balance to the white chocolate chips. These didn't have that. They have a wonderful\nbuttery texture though. So, I'm gonna add just a\nlittle bit of salt on top. I'm not gonna go crazy, but just a little bit of a sprinkle. It'll make a difference. I'm also gonna decorate these with some of my reserved chocolate chips. So, just pop a few on. The idea is they just look nice and clean. There's no dough on them and there'll be pretty and glossy. A cookie should be delicious\nand beautiful if possible. But if it can only be one of the two, it will just be delicious. And then, also add a couple macadamia chunks on top. Okay, so I'm gonna add\njust a tiny sprinkle of some flaked salt on top. It'll give them a nice contrast. And, this flaked salt looks gorgeous. This is gonna go into the oven, 350 for 10 to 12 minutes. They'll be lightly browned\nand the edges will be set. You'll see what they look\nlike in just a moment. Cannot wait to take a bite, but before I do, if you like recipe, check out my cookie playlist. Tons of cookies for you to enjoy and like, just bake, bake, bake,\nbake, bake, bake, bake. Okay, now it's time for a bite. That's like a hello lover moment. Oh my gosh. These are so good. The crunch, the perfect sweetness, a little bit of salt, and that chewy cookie in one package.

Nice and golden brown, awesome, \nand then break it nice and chewy on the inside. Hello and welcome to you\nin the kitchen with Matt. I am your host, Matt Taylor. Today, I'm going to\nshow you how to make macadamia nut cookies. Oh, yeah, I had a request to do \nthis quite a while ago and I'm just now getting to them. If you follow my show,\nyou know that I love cookies. I have quite a few cookie \nvideos already, but no time like the present to \ndo another one. They're really easy to \ndo simple ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. Before I move on, make sure to \nsubscribe to my channel and hit that notification bill so you \ndon't miss out on any of my new videos. Let's get bacon down below. In the description box, \nyou'll find a list of the ingredients and their amounts \nbegin by preheat the oven to three hundred and fifty degrees \nFahrenheit or 176 Celsius. And I have two and a half cups \nof all purpose flour here and a medium bowl, one half teaspoon \nof salt, one teaspoon of baking soda. And also down below, \nyou'll find a metric measurements for all \nthese as well. Let's take a risk and let's \njust risk these together. And you could use a sifter, \ntoo, if you wanted to mix these together with the sifter, \nyou could do that. All right. On the set this aside for now. Now in a large bowl, I'm going \nto add my one cup of salt and butter. I forgot to take it out of the \nfridge earlier, so I just put it in the defroster. It's OK if a little bit of \nit's melted, but you don't want to melt the entire thing. And now I'm going to add one \nhalf cup of white granulated sugar and one cup of \npacked brown sugar. What pact means? It's just how you measure it. You take the brown sugar and \nyou put it in your measuring cup and then you push it down \nwith the spoon and it packs it. And that's the proper way to \nmeasure it with a American Standard Cup. And then if you're going to do \nit by weight for like the grams, then you just \nweigh it normally. And I'll just break that up. And then we are going to mix \nthese together, creaming the sugar with the butter. And then halfway through, \nI'm going to come in here and scrape the sides and you will be scraping the \nsides of the ball periodically throughout this whole \nprocess. OK. All right, we have the sugars \nand the butter cream together, and I have two teaspoons of \nvanilla extract, if you don't have vanilla extract, you can \nuse the same amount of maple syrup. You could also just \nleave it out. But I recommend using the \nvanilla extract if you have it, because it\nadds a lot of flavor. And then I have two large eggs \nand I'm just going to add in one at a time. First egg white. And then in the second egg. All right, give the \nside the straight. And now we want to\nadd in our dry ingredients and I'm just going to add it \nabout a cup at a time. Right. Scrape the sides. And then at this point, \nafter that first cup is in there, I'm going to add my \nmacadamia nuts and these came pre-cut for me already and \nlittle packages, or you can buy the whole macadamia nuts and \nchop them up. And that was a cup \nof macadamia nuts. And I have a\ncup of white chocolate chips. Or you could take like a white \nchocolate bar and just cut that up in chunks by. All right, fantastic. Now we want to keep \nadding that flower. And we'll start to \nget pretty thick. That's OK if you don't have \na mixer, you'll be doing this part with like a wooden spoon \nor a very sturdy spatula. If you were if you\nuse a wet, weak spatula, you might break it. OK, so if you don't have a \nmixer you can use I would use a wooden spoon, start with a whisk and then \nswitch to a wooden spoon. Oh, right, awesome, Shadyside. One more time, one more time \nand kind of just mix it in at this point, you just dig in and \neat all of the raw cookie dough. Now, I'm just kidding. Probably don't want to eat the \nrock or two directors of those raw eggs in there, but little \nsecret I always did growing up. And I may or may not still eat \nraw cookie dough regardless if there are eggs in it. But I do not I'm\nnot advocating that you do it. So then we'll just clean the \nBeta's and there we go. The dough is all ready quite \nquick to make the cookie dough and I usually just bring \neverything together in a ball. And at this point you you can \ncover and chill it in the refrigerator when you want \nto use it. Like if you want to prepare \nthis in stages and do the dough ahead of time, you certainly \ncan do that. But we can also just\nmake the cookies right away. You notice I have a sheet pan \nor you just use a normal cookie sheet. I have it lined with\na silicone mat baking mat. Or you could \nuse parchment paper. I really love the \nsilicone baking mats. If you watch my show, \nfollow my show, you know that I use these quite a bit. I'm just kidding. I have two tablespoons here. I'm just going to \ntake some dough. Not like that. Depends on how big you want to \nmake them and put it down there. Like that and space, they will \nspread out a bit, so I'm in a space of about two \ninches apart. And then I want to take my \nremaining chocolate chips. And just put some\non the top here just so they kind\nof show on the cookie, three or four on the top and \ntake some of the leftover macadamia nut chunks. But those on there as well. Again, purely optional, \nyou could just leave it all inside if you want or put some \non the top, some would do that with the rest of them. And then when you are done, \nwe are going to take this in the oven middle rack position, \nagain, 350 Fahrenheit, 176 Celsius. And we're going to bake it for \neight to 10 minutes, maybe a little bit more. Might be up to 12 minutes. If you want to be soft, \nbake them on the lower end. So I'm going to check\nthem at eight minutes and go from there. And when they come out of \nthe oven, they will look something like this. These took 11 minutes \nin my oven. I'm going to let them sit here \non the hot pan for a few minutes and then I will \ntransfer to a wire rack to cool completely. You can notice that they are \ngolden brown on the edges and lighter in the middle, \nyou know, just depending on the size of your cookies,\nhow long they will bake. And also, depending on how \ncrunchy or soft you want them, you might make them a little \nbit more or a little bit less. All right. They have cooled. I'm going to show you\none look at the bottom. Nice and golden brown. Awesome. And then break it nice and chewy on the inside. Of course, you can bake them \nlonger and get them crunchy or if you want. Mm hmm. All right. The white chocolate macadamia \nnut cookies are done and turned out fantastic. This recipe make somewhere \nbetween 32 and 40 cookies, depending on the size that \nyou make them. Really easy to do. Simple ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. I'm Matt Taylor. This has been another episode \nof In the Kitchen with Matt. Thank you for joining \nme as always.

Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.", "mrLxtfbJ1RY": "Today on Sugar Spun Run I'll be showing you how to make white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies. Hey everyone. Sam here and I'm sure you've probably had a white chocolate chip macadamia nut\ncookie in the past. Now what makes mine so special is a couple of things, but the\nmain thing is that I'm going to be browning the butter for today's recipe.\nNow this is super simple to do and I'll walk you through the steps in just a\nsecond, but you're going to need to start with two sticks or one cup of unsalted\nbutter. Let's go ahead and head over to our saucepan and I'll show you how to\nbrown butter. We'll add our butter to a medium sized saucepan and we'll set our stovetop heat to low or medium low. Just going to let that butter melt slowly.\nDon't crank up the heat yet because then you're going to start browning it\nprematurely. Now when you're browning butter I don't recommend using a metal\nutensil, like a metal spoon, and that's just because the handle tends to get\nreally hot while you're working with that hot butter, in the skillet. I like to\nuse a heat proof utensil like a rubber spatula, a rubber heatproof spatula, or a wooden spoon, or even a whisk that has an insulated handle. Once your butter has\ncompletely melted you'll want to turn your stove top heat to just above medium\nheat. Keep stirring occasionally while your\nbutter heats up. Pretty soon your butter should start bubbling and popping. Now at this point you're going to want to start stirring pretty much constantly. Just\nkeep swirling your spatula, or your spoon through the butter and make sure you're\nscraping the sides and bottom of your saucepan so that the butter doesn't\nstart to burn. Just keep stirring while your butter sizzles and pops. Whatever you do, do not walk away from your butter while it's browning. That is the easiest\nway to burn it. Now this is sizzling and popping because we are cooking the water\nout of our butter. Most butter has about 15 to 20 percent water, and we're cooking\nthis out of our butter enriching it, and then ultimately will be browning those\nmilk solids that are found in the butter. That is what gives this butter such a\ngood flavor when it's finished cooking. Once the sizzling and popping starts to\nslow down this is when you really need to be careful, and keep an eye on your\nbutter. Now at this point, you're looking for that butter to start to\nbe turning brown. So you see we have some foam here. I'm just trying to, as I'm\nswirling my spatula through the butter, I'm just looking for any sign that it's\nstarting to turn brown. We have a little bit of brown here. I'm just gonna take\nthis just a little bit further. Alright, if you can see that it's nice and brown\nso we want to immediately remove it from the heat. Now this saucepan is really hot,\nso if you leave your brown butter in the saucepan it's going to keep cooking and\ncould even end up burning your butter. So what I recommend is, as soon as you\nremove that saucepan from the heat, immediately pour your butter into a heat\nproof bowl. That'll stop it from cooking, and it's going to keep you from burning\nyour butter. And make sure you scrape all of those brown bits out of your saucepan because that is what gives this butter such a good flavor. Now when making these cookies, or when making just about anything with brown\nbutter, it's really important that the butter cools down before you add any\nother ingredients to it. Now the best way to check is just to touch the bottom of\nthe bowl. If it feels even a little bit warm you're going to want to let your\nbutter cool just a bit longer. Now it can take thirty minutes, or an hour, or even\nlonger for your butter to come back down to room temperature.\nI've let this cool for a bit. It's just about there but since it's still a\nlittle warm we're going to go ahead and start prepping our dry ingredients. Now\nyou're going to need a medium sized bowl with 2 and 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour.\nWe're going to add a tablespoon of cornstarch which helps to make these\ncookies nice and soft. A teaspoon of baking powder, a teaspoon of baking soda,\nand 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Now stir everything together until your\ningredients are completely combined. Now that we've prepped our dry ingredients\nlet's check on that brown butter. So this does not feel even a little bit warm to\nthe touch, so we can go ahead and combine our wet ingredients. So I'm just gonna\nscrape this into a larger bowl just to make it easier for me to stir everything\ntogether, and I do mean scrape. You want to scrape all of those brown bits from\nthe bottom of your first bowl into your new bowl. That is what gives these\ncookies such a good flavor. Now along with that butter we're going\nto add one cup of firmly packed brown sugar. And 2/3 cup of granulated sugar. Stir everything together until your sugar and your butter are nicely combined. We'll add two large eggs, and you want these to be room temperature. And one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract and just stir everything together again. Once you have all your wet ingredients nicely combined, grab your flour mixture and we're just gonna gradually stir this into our butter\nmixture. Now the only thing left to add to our\ncookie dough is our macadamia nuts, and our chocolate chips. We're going to be\nadding one cup of dry roasted chopped macadamia nuts, and one cup of white\nchocolate chips. Fold these into your batter. I do recommend chilling this cookie dough before baking with it so we're\njust gonna cover the bowl with plastic wrap. And transfer this to our fridge\nwhere it will chill for at least 30 minutes. While your dough is chilling\nyou'll want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Once your dough is\nfinished chilling and your oven is preheated, you want to grab your dough\nfrom the fridge and we can start scooping it. I just like to use my 1 and\n1/2 tablespoon size cookie scoop. Just scoop this dough And just for a nice\nneat uniform appearance, I like to roll this cookie dough in the palm of my hand. Just roll it between my palms until I have a nice smooth cookie dough ball. Alright let's take these cookies over to our 375 degree fahrenheit preheated oven\nwhere they'll need to bake for about 9 to 11 minutes. Now you'll want to let\nthese cookies cool completely on the baking sheet because when they come out\nof the oven the center should still be a little bit underdone. Letting them cool\ncompletely on the baking sheet lets them finish cooking, and gives you a nice soft\ncookie center. Now these have finished cooling, and I wish you could smell how\ngood my house smells right now. This is a really simple cookie recipe, made\nextra-special by the addition of brown butter, and I really think you're going\nto love it. If you try this one out please let me know what you think. I\nalways love hearing from you. Thank you guys so much for watching and I will see\nyou next time. They're good.", "CFVVA9YU3fo": "(light music) - If you love a good soft and chewy cookie full of white chocolate\nand macadamia nuts, these cookies are for you. Stop what you're doing and make them. They're so good and totally addicting and I think cookies can be a little tricky so I'm going to show you all my tips today. (bright music) Hi, I'm Lindsay from Life,\nLove and Sugar and today, we're making white chocolate\nmacadamia nut cookies. So the first thing we're going to want to do is combine our dry ingredients. We've got some all-purpose flour here and you really wanna make sure that you measure this accurately, small differences in your flour can make a big difference in\nthe way your cookie turns out. The best thing you can\ndo is use a food scale, if you don't have one, I\nsuggest stirring up your flour with a spoon and then measuring it with your measuring spoon. And we've got some baking soda. I actually really like\nbaking soda in cookies 'cause I think generally\nit gives you a softer, chewier cookie and it's gonna\nstay that way for longer. And then a little salt. Never forget your salt,\nit adds nice flavor. And then we'll whisk those together. We'll set this aside while we work on the rest of our ingredients. The next thing we're gonna\nwork with is our sugars. We're using white sugar and brown sugar. Brown sugar adds a really\nnice moisture and flavor so we've got a mix of the two. And then we're gonna add our butter which is at room temperature. So we're gonna pop this on our\nmixer and cream it together. You wanna let it cream\nfor about four minutes, scrape down the sides of\nthe bowl as much as you need and just make sure you get\na nice fluffy consistency and you should really\nsee it lighten in color. (pops) (whirring) All right, so when everything\nis fully creamed together, you're ready to move on. I'll go ahead and give you a visual of what you're looking for\nin case you aren't familiar. So you can see how it's\ngotten this really, like nice creamy fluffy texture to it and you can also see how it\nstarted out a little bit darker in color and now it's\nactually a lot lighter. So next we're gonna add in our egg yolk. Stir that in there until\nit's pretty well combined. And we can add in our full egg. We'll go ahead and add\nour vanilla extract. Right, once all that's combined, we're gonna add our dry ingredients. We don't wanna over mix it, so once it's all kinda nicely mixed, and maybe there's just\na touch of flour left, we're gonna take this bowl off the mixer and kind of finish with our spatula. So things have just\nstarted to come together. It is a pretty thick cookie dough. You can see there's a little\nbit of flour around in there and we're gonna just go ahead\nand mix that in ourselves. Just make sure you're getting everything incorporated in there. At this point I'm also gonna\nadd just a touch of milk to help everything come\ntogether at the end. It's only gonna be about a teaspoon, maybe a teaspoon and a half, you really don't wanna add\ntoo much additional liquid to these cookies or they could\nspread too much in the oven. So you just wanna add enough that it kind of brings\neverything together. So I'm gonna do about one,\nmaybe one and a half teaspoons. Now the fun part, we've\ngot our macadamia nuts and our white chocolate chips. We'll just stir those in and then we'll be ready to make our balls. Okay, so this is a cookie dough that I think is best to\nrefrigerate prior to baking. It just, the moisture\nreally kind of soaks up into the cookies and you just get a softer and chewier cookie, it\nstays that way for longer. It's definitely better. You wanna refrigerate it for at least two to three\nhours if not overnight. And so I actually like to\nmake my cookie dough balls before I refrigerate it, that way when they come out of the fridge, it's easy to pop them right in the oven. I do two tablespoons sized\nballs of cookie dough. One thing to note when\nyou're making cookies is, if you have larger balls\nof cookie dough or smaller, that also affects the way they spread. A larger ball of cookie dough\nis going to spread more. So just keep that in mind as you're making your cookie dough balls if you reduce it or increase it, your cookies may turn\nout a little differently. I've never really liked\nany of the cookie scoops that I've used so I just use my tablespoon and then measure out two of those. I'm gonna throw these into a nice ball. And you just wanna keep going until you've used all\nof your cookie dough. When you're done making\nyour cookie dough balls, you wanna pop these in the fridge for about three hours or overnight. So after your cookie dough\nhas chilled in the fridge, you wanna let them sit out\nfor about an hour to soften and then you'll pop them\nunder your cookie sheet. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with a silicone baking mat but you can use parchment\npaper too if you prefer. You could pop them in\nthe oven just like that or you can kinda add a\ncouple extra chocolate chips and nuts if you like, just so they have kind\nof a pretty look in them when they come out of the oven. And now we're ready to\npop these in the oven and they bake for about\neight minutes in my oven. All ovens are a little different so adjust if you need to for your oven. Okay, so once your cookies\ncome out of the oven, if you find that they spread\na little more than you want to or you just wanna shape\nthem a little differently, you can actually use a spoon and just kinda tuck the edges in. They should spread nicely. If they haven't spread\nas much as you want, there are a couple possibilities. One could be that you overmeasured\nyour flour a little bit, the other could be that\nmaybe the cookie dough was a little cold when\nit went in the oven. The other possibility is\nwith a cookie like these, with all these mix-ins, if you have a cookie that has a lot more of the macadamia nuts and white chocolate\nchips than another one, it could just be that they kinda stayed in a mound in the middle of the cookies and so it just didn't spread very well. So those are some things\nyou can pay attention to with your cookies, in some ways you can\nkind of make adjustments. so when your cookies have cooled, you can put them in an airtight container and store them for a couple of days or just go ahead and put them\non a nice serving platter and serve them right to your guests, they're ready to go. These cookies are soft,\nchewy, nice and thick, and they are full of white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. They are so delicious. I really hope you enjoy them.

product this delicious cookie we've actually done a few flavors now this one included the double chocolate which you can see from a few weeks back with Dane and Sally and they have been very very busy developing more flavors and my new favorite one is the birthday cake cookie which has been flying off the counter we bake them all throughout the day oh yeah goodbye Madame reprobates as well they smell warm still so these get baked throughout the day and people are loving them so we thought it was too good a recipe not to share with you so sad he's going to show you how to do it the owner I'm going to eat these okay so we are here upstairs in Soho with the wonderful Dane Dane works here he went all day every day looking after the bakery making sure the shop is fully stocked with cakes and cookies and our brand new cookie which we just took downstairs it's the birthday cake cookies and which is basically the same as other ones yeah we and we've tweaked it a little bit so and when we go along with the recipe we'll tell you what we've treats and why and yeah yeah we'll just get started I think so so we've got our first layer like last time it's nice and cold from the fridge I've cut it up into kind of large cubes and that will go straight into the mixer you're gonna crank this up and get it moving just until the butter starts to break up a little bit [Music] omit oh yeah so it's not like in the other videos but we'll just explain that again come on I've seen those we're not looking to sort of cream this or whip it because the butters cold you just want to break it down a little bit and you're noticed as we go through the recipe that we're really not mixing this at all we're just kind of combining it yes so next we go in with the sugars yes she types of sugars the castor sugar and stuff like brown sugar and in this recipe the last recipe we had equal amounts of sugar but this time we've got a little bit less castor sugar yes and that is because we were talking earlier about how we've kind of adapted a little bit basically we've got different inclusions so different things going in it which isn't it's not as simple as just kind of replacing those which we kind of thought it was yeah and so we did that and actually they bake totally differently so we've tweaked things along the way and we'll talk about our chocolate in a minute but it's a different quantity we've got sprinkles as well and that has an overall effect on the kind of sweetness so that's why we have reduced the sugar yes that's going into the bowl and we're just got that mixing on low speed we combine them cool and in the meantime we're gonna chop this up and you may be wondering what this this is the best thing ever it is caramelized white chocolate and it started off looking like this and now it looks like this this was done in the microwave here but he did it in the oven and we showed you how to do that a few weeks ago in the caramelized chocolate Swiss meringue buttercream recipe so we will pop that in the description box and this is 200 grams of pure gold and we've got 300 grams of regular chocolate chips and so I'm gonna pass you those and I'm just gonna roughly chop this up even the drunk is quite big so that you get those nice kind of pockets of melty easy deliciousness [Music] what do you think think that's about right it's good nice big chunks mmm dee-licious it's very hard not to eat this as it is yeah so those are all going in at this stage so we've got butter sugar and no chocolate in there and we're gonna put that back on to just kind of like a low-speed just to combine them [Music] so chocolate is nicely combining the bowl with butter and sugar next ingredient I'm going to add is the flour so I've got 400 grams of plain flour and 100 grams of self-raising flour yep and into that we're gonna add baking powder and salt we've added it separately I'm just gonna give it a whisk through like we said earlier we don't want to let over whip this or anything so we're just gonna mix these salt and baking powder in now right that's nicely mixed through so ready for you so that was all in and we're just gonna mix up on a low speed just until it gets to a kind of dry sandy consistency I'm gonna add our sprinkles straight in but never mix them with the wet dough because then it will break the sprinkles like a little bit too much you don't want them to kind of bleed into the batter at all all right so that looks pretty good it's kind of a bread crumb me I guess notice I'm kind of dry yeah it just sounds wrong but it's right so in with the sprinkles [Music] okay wrinkles are n and then we've got our next ingredient is eggs we've got three eggs here I'm gonna use two whole eggs and one Thank You yolk I've got the addition of the egg yolk just because this mix is a little bit drier with the addition of sprinkles just let's bind it all together this week and then we're still a whisper I was getting in there and it's all wet and this will just help some not overmix the yeah a little bit like why we kind of mixed the flowers together and the raising agents so I'm just gonna put in a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and remember to use a good quality one because it makes all the differences [Music] so that excellent I'm just gonna mix it until it's come together every day and it's not kind funding anymore it doesn't take long it kind of looks like it's getting to that stage already is about 30 seconds to a minute the most I'd say that probably is their hair yeah so kind of come away from the sides and come into like one big lump basically and that's me you know it's pretty cool so I'm just gonna clear the decks of it because now we need to roll them into balls so we're gonna get our scales because we want them all to be perfect okay we're gonna weigh them out to be what silent 125 grams this one's cool perfect and we'll put them in a tray right here we go hello these new clothes I know but like that a scientist glove yeah very fine smart smart right okay let's do this let's say where's balls yeah oh my gosh doing this you see any time so we're not kind of rolling these into kind of perfect balls and very gently just squishing them together and popping them into the tray you don't want to overwork it because we want needs to be kind of chunky and a bit kind of terror party [Music] so we have got 14 cookies all nice and even and they are not quite ready to bake I'm afraid we need to freeze these for about what we'd say minimum 19 minutes yeah overnight it's perfect and that's what we have done so we will just get our ones that we made earlier actually Dane made them earlier like I said he's here all the time and they've been frozen and we are gonna put them in the oven now just so oven is set to 80 degrees centigrade and that's with a fan and also in the oven we've got a baking tray heating up so it's nice and hot so you get the bottom of these cookies nice and crispy so let's do this together [Music] [Applause] [Music] cool and we are baking them for 14 minutes and check them after about kind of 13 to 14 we're going to get them till they're nice and kind of golden on the outside if they don't look golden just pop them in for another minute [Music] [Music] it's like okay and they smell amazing to you yeah they've been calling over about ten minutes but they're still warm and we are gonna take them downstairs but each time when you do need to try them the effect that is not and you need to see what they look like when you say just in time around the back of the table oh here you go here is your birthday cake cookie oh my goodness these smell so good I mean there's some weights of these bad boys you put I don't have like a lot of them because they're a massive tree they look amazing yeah oh right back house I took it look easy now mmm yummy birthday cake vibes as well no it's a lot because I'm birthday cakes put a thing in America too isn't it yeah no I could popular flavor so we'll have these install all week come down and try them try out other ones to the double choc flip we've got the milk chocolate walnut one as well unlike Gemma's have le we bake them all day every day so they'll always be fresh I'm in a little bit on a little bit gooey yummers yeah and we'll put with the recipes to the other ones in the description box as well yeah right and if there's a combination of flavors that you think we should could be fine let us know in the comments box because feels like we should just take over the cookie well yeah 100% I mean we love cupcakes but kind of lovin cookin yay awesome cool thanks guys well make sure you tune in next week for another video and make sure you tune in these other gloves and the hash tag cupcake Gemma on in oh yeah you make these because these are obviously very very Instagram aboard make sure you know them yeah we'll put all about Instagram and handles is that Andale some what we're calling them in the description box so you can check out what we're all up to as well because we're always making yummy scrummy [Laughter] [Laughter] [Music]", "4TNpU4tWpx8": "[Music] i don't know about you but i absolutely love cookies i am a proper cookie monster so today i thought i'd show you how to make gluten-free white chocolate and raspberry cookies it's probably my favorite combination of all cookie combinations but every cookie is amazing um but i just love these they're really seasonal at the moment with raspberries being something that we have in our garden so we just can pick them and put them in cookies i mean you don't have to just eat them as they are there's so many things you can do with raspberries but the best thing is white chocolate chip and raspberry cookies so this recipe can also very easily be made dairy free it can also quite easily be made vegan and low fodmap as well so it's super versatile and it's also versatile because if you didn't have raspberries for instance you could probably use strawberries you don't have to put the raspberries in you could just make white chocolate chip cookies or you could swap pizza milk chocolate and raspberry cookies or just milk chocolate chip cookies there's so many things you can do with this recipe and it's really really simple to make there's very very few ingredients and you'll just have really delicious cookies super quickly and another good thing about it is that you can freeze the dough and so you can prepare it in advance and then cook them when you want to eat them which i mean cookies on cookies on tap does that make sense yeah you can basically have cookies on top if you have cookies whenever you want if you want to follow along or just want to check out the recipe written down then i will link it in the description below but before i show you how i make them i will show you what's in them so let's get on with the ingredients right so as i said ingredients are really really simple with this firstly we've got some gluten-free plain flour slash all-purpose flour i've got some melted butter if you are dairy free or vegan you can use vegan butter slash dairy free spread or whatever you're melting it so it doesn't really matter what it is um i've got one egg in this recipe so if you are vegan you can very easily use an egg replace so you can use a flax egg you can use whatever sort of egg replacement you would like to use i've got vanilla extract i've then got some bicarbonate of soda um i have got sugar i've got two different types of sugar here i've got caster sugar granulated sugar is fine too and light brown sugar i've got some freeze-dried raspberries here these are just sort of a decoration kind of thing and i don't tend to use them that much but i found some in the cupboard so i've got them here for that i don't tend to use them as much because they're really expensive how many you get but if you've got them they do make things look kind of pretty so that's why i'd use them i've got white chocolate chips here which is just glorious and the best and then i've got obviously the most important ingredient really except the white chocolate chips is the raspberries now these raspberries are fresh raspberries but i've had them in the freezer for a little bit because i find that making them with slightly frozen raspberries is better because otherwise they squish and they'll just change the color of the dough more to being really pink if you're not careful you can obviously use fresh raspberries that aren't frozen i've done that many times and they taste great you can use frozen raspberries as well so whatever raspberries you've got you pretty much can use them but these ones are just slightly slightly frozen only like for about an hour so they're just a bit more fun and i'm going to put them back in the freezer until i'm ready to use them in the recipe yeah that's that's pretty much all you need um so yeah let's go with it okay so we're going to start off by adding our sugar and our melted butter to the bowl you want your motherboard to be slightly cool at this point not boiling boiling hot and then we'll just mix them together until they're really combined well um kind of stiff if you get me like i'll show you okay so the butter and the sugar are nicely combined now you can see that they're sort of more of a i don't know almost like a soft paste you don't want to just do this really quickly and be like oh they're combined because it'll be too soft and the mixture just doesn't work then so you need to definitely allow the butter to cool before you add it um quite a bit anyway and then it should look a bit like this and this should be how it is before you add the eggs so i'm now going to add my egg and some vanilla extract and then mix it all together you might see that i'm doing this all by hand you can use an electric hand mixer you could use a stand mixture if you wanted i just enjoy when i can do anything by hand because there's less washing up so when you're doing it by hand you just need to give it a little bit more welly but obviously if you really fancy it you can use something electric instead [Music] okay so once that's nice and smooth like this then it's time to add your flour and your bicarbonate soda it is quite a lot of flour like a lot so you really need to mix it thoroughly to make sure that there's no like little pockets of flour um or any sort of dry bits but once you've mixed it you'll see that it becomes a really really nice cookie dough okay so there's your cookie dough as you can see it's fairly soft but we're going to be putting in the fridge to chill it and firm it up a bit but it's not runny in any way so it's squidgy but it's fine so it shouldn't be sort of like cake mixture at this point it should be firm enough that you can sort of do this in your hands not that we're going to at the moment but i'm just trying to show you because you need to have the right texture at this point if you want to continue next up we'll add the white chocolate chips and mix them in so that they're evenly dispersed now next up we want to mix in our raspberries we want to do this really carefully as you can see i've cut them into pieces because i don't put that much raspberry in it if you cut them they go a bit further so we want to mix them in but do it so much more gently than you've ever done anything before because you don't want them to split too much i mean they'll break up a little bit just because the dough is quite firm but you don't want to do it too much or it'll just sort of leak everywhere also another thing that you could add at this point is you could add some of these but i generally prefer to just sprinkle them on top um but you can definitely add them at this point if you are going to use them as i said you don't have to um and you can add more raspberries than i've said you can add less raspberries than i said don't go too far with the raspberries obviously because it will just get a bit wet um so keep it minimal in a way um but this amount of raspberries goes quite a long way [Music] and there you go i was very very careful when i added my raspberries not to mix it too much not to go crazy but you can see still some of the raspberry has sort of mixed into the dough and made it a little bit pinky that's completely fine i mean it's just a visual thing and it actually looks quite nice but you definitely don't want to mix it too much and that's where sort of frozen or semi-frozen raspberries comes in really handy because they just don't break up quite as quickly especially on a hot day i'd really really recommend that when you have really sort of really almost over ripe raspberries so now that that's done you can see the dough is quite quite firm in a way but not firm enough so we're going to cover this with cling film and place it into the fridge for around an hour you could put it in the freezer for around half an hour but i'm just going to pop this in the fridge for an hour and then it'll be firm enough for us to roll it into balls and cook it in the oven oh also yes you could roll this into balls now and then freeze them in balls but i find with the raspberries especially that it's much easier to chill the whole mixture and then roll it when it's all cold because otherwise you get raspberry hands and it goes everywhere so yeah chill it as a lump for about an hour you don't want to chill it as a lump for ages and ages and ages because then you won't be able to roll them very easily and you might just have to let it warm up a bit but if you do it for around an hour should be perfect okay so my cookie dough is now completely chilled and nice and firm so it's time to roll it into balls so i'm gonna get my weighing scales and i'm going to weigh each one so it's an even weight i usually do it about 55 grams but i'm gonna just judge it and i'll i'll let you know how how heavy each ball is but ideally you want to make them nice and even um and you do want to be a bit careful with these because you don't want to roll them too much because the raspberry obviously will just go into your hands a bit um another thing that i always like is to have a few bits of chocolate chip and raspberry on top of each ball because otherwise when you cook the cookie you won't be able to see any white chocolate raspberry and you won't have a clue what the cookie is what flavour is even though i guess you kind of will because you made them yourself but other people won't and it's nice for them to have a good visual look as well um so yeah i'm going to roll these now and i'm going to put them onto a baking tray i'm not gonna put too many on because they will flatten out um it's better to do them in batches or do them on a couple of trays so that you don't get all like merged cookies because that is just like the worst okay let's roll some balls [Music] so here is all my cookie dough rolled into balls look very nice and pink and pretty a bit messy to make just because the fresh raspberries but it's not really to be honest it's just more so than if you didn't have the fresh raspberries but then it wouldn't be so tasty so as i said i would let you know the weight of each of these these were about it's really random right 58 grams each i did them um so i did that so that they'd be nice and even i haven't rolled these as much into balls as you'll see some of them are a bit slightly odd shaped you can sort of try and form them more into balls but you don't want to roll them as i said because then the raspberry will go all over your hands which isn't what you ideally want um so i am now obviously not going to cook them all on this baking tray i just put them there until i was ready i'm going to split them and put them onto two different baking trays because they'll need some room to spread so on this one i'll probably put six maybe um and then six on another one and then i think there's 14 here so a couple for later maybe um yeah definitely definitely spread them out never think that your tray is you know never think that you can fit loads on a tray because you can't they'll spread so i'm now going to place these into my preheated oven at 160 degrees c fan which is 180 degrees c which i believe now is 350 degrees fahrenheit i never seem to get that right or have any idea but i remember this time so yeah it's it's as simple as that so let's put these babies in the oven so that they can come out we can let them cool and we can actually get to eating them because that's all i want to do with cookies i want to eat them [Music] so that is all my cookies out of the oven now these ones have been out a little bit longer because i cook them in batches so that i cook more on the middle shelf for the same amount of time and i didn't have too many on a sheet um so these ones are still cooling a little bit so these ones are gonna they've literally just come out they're gonna cool on this baking tray for about 10 minutes or so until they're firmer and then i will use this to transfer them onto here and then they will finish cooling completely on here you don't want to take them off before that because they'll literally fall to pieces but after a few minutes nice and firm and delicious so very shortly i'll be able to eat these but for now i need to be patient and let these completely cool i have some very very good news the cookies are cooled they are ready to show you slash eat slash yeah look at that so we've got loads of white chocolate chips the raspberry just soft squidgy cookie it's like crisp but squidgy it's like everything that you want everything that you want in a cookie is in my hand i just keep wanting to show you because this cookie is a lot better to look at than my face um but yeah i guess you don't want to just look at them he's kind of quite like to make them well i quite like you to

Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how to make my oatmeal almond white chocolate chip cookie sound like a mouthful but they're so easy I cannot tell you how good the combination is of the O with hot with the vanilla from the chocolate chips because there's a white chocolate chips for the almond so incredibly good your kitchens gonna smell amazing they're perfect perfect perfect and they're so quick to make and then we take your wet ingredients so we can get started you're going to all-purpose flour some just quick cooking oats not instant pinch of salt baking soda brown sugar regular sugar white chocolate chip an egg some unsalted butter that's been softened to room temperature almond extract that's a my friend they're very basic and easy I haven't made cookies in a while because to be honest I'm a girl that likes to make cookies a lot during fall and winter and sometimes during the spring and summer it's just not something I get around to doing but I had a craving for cookies I wanted to make something different these really hit the spot and no I'm not pregnant I just crave cookies because I love to eat so the first thing you wanna do is get your oven preheated to 375 second thing you wanna do is stick baking sheets lined with parchment paper get those ready now I've have the recipe only because it's just my husband at 9:00 tonight and we just want a couple cookies in fact I'm probably just going to bake half of this and put the rest of the dough in the freezer because they freeze this beautifully and it falls out incredibly well so I'm going to put the full recipe online online kitchen I'm going to put in my unsalted butter that's been softened to room temperature in my standing mixer that's been fitted with a paddle attachment and this just makes life a lot easier so then I'm going to add in my sugars pop this up and cream this together really really well and while that's happening I'm just going to take my dry ingredients I'm going to give these a good stir I'm just going to wait for those to be nice and creamy I want to add in our egg that's beautiful I'm gonna add in my egg I don't feel like Judy from the street I'm it's beautiful so add in my egg almond extract now I've mentioned it a million times whenever you're working with almond extract or any other extract besides vanilla you need to measure it because this stuff is so strong it'll ruin your Joe completely so I'm not going to add too too much that's plenty I've had this for literally probably a year and I mean I still have something left of it I still have another teaspoon or so left in here that's because it just last so long you need so little of it it's gonna let those go get those mixed well and we'll add in our dry ingredients now look amazing now make sure that you're always mixing you know you're always stopping your mixture to give everything a really good scrape and of course you can do this in just a bowl with a wooden spoon the spatula it worked just fine so I'm gonna add in my dry mixture if I say so one more time I kid you not I'm gonna I'm gonna zip my lips shut I feel like that's like my new word nowadays so so I'm over saying it okay so no just I'm going to just light my giant greens make some solder in coorporate it and it's going to literally take about a minute if that really it's working really well already in fact that looks so good I'm gonna add in my white chocolate chips at this point only because I don't want to over mix the dry ingredients otherwise I develop the gluten and they come out like little hockey pucks instead of being beautiful little soft and chewy delicious cookies these are pretty much done okay love it when that happens take this off scrape off all of your dough from your little attachment into your bowl that's looking beautiful okay I'm gonna take my handy dandy small ice cream scoop this is about a tablespoon measure I'm going to take each little one and pop them just a few inches apart from each other and that is it my friend now of course you want to do this and you know multiple baking sheets but like I said I'm only gonna bake one baking sheet because it's just my husband and I we just wanted some cookies but the rest of it freeze it so beautifully and then you can just thaw it in the refrigerator or even on your counter and sometimes I even pop it in the microwave for about 30 seconds at a time until the dough is completely thawed and you can have fresh baked cookies at a moment's notice just in case anybody shows up uninvited which happens pretty frequently around here it's gonna fill these all up until I'm making sure is nice and full last one okay these are gonna go into the oven that's been preheated to 375 and they're gonna bake for about nine to eleven minutes a little lightly golden now let them cool completely before you can dig in if you can resist them I probably what you want was really nice and hot my cookies baked for exactly 11 minutes now pretty much let them cool completely and I didn't dig into them yet which shocking I know I've seen crazier things happen but I wanted to let these cool for a bit so I could kind of really show you if I open one up kind of how chewy look at that I'm gonna just kind of show you they're not sort of super crispy they're got a lovely chew to them mmm-hmm why are cookies so good why are sweet things so good hmm new almond with the vanilla from the boy chocolate chip vanilla II apparently is a new word hope you enjoy spending time with me guys head over to Laura any kitchen and

nut keto cookie this thing is soft it's chewy it's perfectly sweetened and it is absolutely delicious now as a lot of you guys know i love making quick and easy keto recipes there's some of my favorite recipes to make and i also love making recipes with portion control built into them and today's cookie recipe is all those things so instead of making an entire batch like 12 or 15 cookies and overeating on those cookies i'm gonna show you how to make one cookie to satisfy your sweet tooth and that way you don't over eat now with that said let's jump right into the good stuff make this low carb keto cookie okay first things first let's get out a large egg and warm it up to room temperature basically all that means is we're going to add some warm water to a bowl add our egg to it and then set it aside so now that we've taken care of that in a medium-sized bowl we're going to add a heaping third of a cup or 45 grams of blanched almond flour then we're gonna sweeten up our keto cookie without adding any net carbs by using two heaping tablespoons or 20 grams of confectioners swerve so once you've got that in there we can add a nice pinch of salt and then that's gonna do it for the dry ingredients at the moment so as you're seeing here we're gonna mix all those ingredients up until they're well combined and then when they are we can add a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract to them now we're gonna get our room temperature egg out from earlier separate the yolk from the white and then add the yolk to our bowl then once that's taken care of we're gonna get out about four or five macadamia nuts or about 10 grams of them and then we're going to use a nut crusher to crush those into tiny pieces so when those are looking good and crushed up we're gonna add around half of them to our bowl and then we're gonna give everything a good mix in there with our spatula that said when we've got some thick cookie dough crumbles going on in there we'll eventually want to use our hands to form a ball of cookie dough and then from that ball of dough we'll actually want to shape and form our cookie out of it now when we've got our cookie shaped nicely from that ball of dough we're going to top it with our leftover macadamia nuts and then pop it in our microwave for around 30 seconds so when our cookie is done in the microwave we're gonna get out some keto friendly white chocolate chips like these and then we're gonna add them to the top of our cookie as well and as far as how many we'll be adding we're actually going to want to add around a half a tablespoon or five grams of them to our cookie so when we've got those added we're gonna pop our cookie back in the microwave for another 30 seconds and then when it's done in there we're gonna let the cookie cool down to room temperature and firm up a bit then when it's had a chance to cool and set you should end up with a white chocolate chip macadamia nut keto cookie like this it's soft it's chewy it's filled with white chocolate chip macadamia nut deliciousness and i cannot wait for you guys to try it anyway as always for more info on today's recipe check out the video description below

a comment subscribe and I'll see you next time for another delicious recipe you", "zOUpBtaYoow": "hello and welcome to crouton crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make these delicious half-and-half cookies can't decide whether you want chocolate chip cookies or chocolate cookies with white chocolate chips make both of them into one cookie these are the grains that you need so let's get started I'm going to start off using my stand mixer here you can also use a large bowl with an electric mixer I'm going to add in one stick of softened butter as well as half a cup of white granulated sugar and a quarter cup of packed light brown sugar and using the paddle attachment I'm just going to mix that together until the butter and sugars are creamed together while and once those are nicely mixed I'm going to add in one large egg as well as one teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm going to put my mixer back down and turn it on to low and I'm going to mix this mixture just until that egg and the vanilla is incorporated in the butter and sugar mixture you don't want to over mix this and once that comes together you want to remove that from your mixer bowl into a large bowl and then you want to make up that same portion of the recipe again because we're doing two different cookies at one time here now that I have both of those made up and in their individual bowls one is going to be made into chocolate chip cookies and the other one is going to be chocolate cookies with white chocolate chips so to each bowl I'm going to add one cup of flour to the chocolate chip cookies I'm going to add 1/3 of a cup of additional flour and to the chocolate cookies I'm going to add 1/3 of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder I'm also going to add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt to each bowl as well as half a teaspoon of baking soda to each bowl and then using a wooden spoon I'm going to mix up each mixture individually now that each of my cooking bases are done and mixed together I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to my white dough and 3/4 of a cup of white chocolate chips to my chocolate dough and again using a spoon I'm just going to mix those chips up into the cookie dough and once they are mixed together you want to cover these and put these into the refrigerator and let the dough's chill and set up for about an hour or so and once your cookie dough's are nice and chilled you want to take about a tablespoon of each cookie mixture and just kind of roughly shape it into a ball shape and then take each of those little balls and smush them together you don't want to roll this into a ball because then your line is going to get deformed and you want kind of a straight line down the center then you want to gently Pat it out just a little bit so it's a little bit flat and then set it off onto a cookie sheet and once you get a sheet of these made up pop them into a preheated 325 degree fahrenheit oven and bake them for 12 to 15 minutes or until they are just barely light brown around the edges and when they are done let them rest on the cookie sheet for about a minute or so and then remove them off to a wire rack to cool completely lay your cookie sheet cool down a little bit and then make up some more cookies and there you go that is how I made half and a half cookies if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up

everything in here you're measuring brown sugar make sure you pack it into your measuring cup to get there accurate measurement and make sure your butter is at room temperature once you've cream your butter and your sugars together we're going to add two large eggs so I have 2 and 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour here we're going to add 1 teaspoon of baking powder I'm just going to stir this in here and we're going to start gradually adding it into our batter add a little bit at a time just beat it in after each addition I'm going to be using 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and I'm also using about half a cup of white chocolate baking bar and I've chopped it up into smaller pieces I use Ghirardelli brand chocolates for most of my baking recipes I'm also adding half a cup of cha macadamia nuts you can use any type of nuts that you like like pecans and walnuts almonds I think macadamia nuts add a lot of flavor and I love that they're these are full of fat and they kind of melt in your mouth once they're baked in the oven I'm also adding half a cup of toffee chips I'm going to add everything into my mixer bowl fold it all together this is also a good time to pre-heat your oven so we need to preheat our oven to 350 degrees I use my spatula and just fold everything together grab your cookie scoop and I have a large one so there's two tablespoons in here and we're going to place our cookie batter onto a baking sheet now make sure to leave enough space between them because these are gonna be fairly large cookies now you can always make these smaller use like 1 tablespoon of batter I'm just going to flatten my cookies out just a little bit and I'm going into my preheated oven and we're going to bake them just until the edges start turning golden brown once your cookies come out of the oven just set them on a cooling rack and let them cool completely I have my cookies all done now so I have some of the extra-large chocolate chip cookies they also made some smaller ones make whichever one you'd prefer but make sure to store these cookies in an airtight container just so they don't loose they're soft and chewy Center break one open and also have to grab a glass of milk Oh

believe I thought those were the macadamia part of the cookie anyway we're gonna make walnuts white chocolate chip instead of academia white chocolate chip and we'll see how it goes kind of excited hopefully it comes out amazing alrighty so step one it says add 2 and 1/3 cups of all-purpose flour 2 and 1/3 I try my best not to make a mess one but like that owl and when they come in the middle of the Oreo and then we're the third cup it's okay to be off a little bit your grandma does it it'd be alright alrighty and then we put a tablespoon of baking powder or baking soda like this um I got baking soda I got baking soda Oh that'll work spooning a little - alright salt blender and salt on a low speed how much salt a teaspoon of salt alrighty alrighty so we got all the dry ingredients mix you know what I need some more lighting going on alright much better thank you see now and now we're gonna add some walnuts just too much that looks exciting yeah that work I'll mix it around I wonder if this whisk will be good enough oh yeah perfect all the dry stuff and next is going to be the wet stuff it's gonna be butter and sugar pretty much and then we mix them all together oh and I think it's gonna be in the other one as well almost forgot to add the most important part what the heck why is there not updating there we go maybe that'll work better the white chocolate oh yeah it's gonna be amazing I don't know how many cookies gonna make us coming a lot I bet so it calls for two sticks of butter softened put it in the microwave in a bowl that's not microwavable thinks that they appreciate that insight after the fact but anyway we move on there's gonna be three quarter cups of brown sugar and white sugar I don't know if I build it believe in this this seems like quite a bit sugar goo alright off all the measurements follow the measurements that looks like three quarters away submission all down oh yeah perfect if I can push it down all right perfect now three quarters of a cup of the white stuff yeah I need to get me like a camera person there's something yeah okay once I get that stand I bought my wish for a dollar it's gonna make its own money okay I stopped there I don't want to yeah that's no it's not the quarters 3/4 3/4 yep 3/4 cup crazy okay oh and the huevos those are next that is exciting all right break time already we got the vanilla right here see how it goes this is 1 tsp I'm hoping that's a teaspoon tablespoon no one else great now I'm gonna try to be like Gordon Ramsay Oh crack an egg with one hand wish me luck I'm hoping no shells get in there oh but hey yeah Eddie I bet you can do that do you see any no shells nice that's one down one more to go it's like perfection no double yolk today we weren't that lucky but we keep going mix that up I'm not just gonna wash my hand once I get to the the big times I'll get one of those damn this thing is filled when I make it to the big times I'm gonna get one of those kitchen mixers that they make the bundle sitting and just have it mix it and I'll just sit here and talk with you guys maybe have a beer but right now we gotta put some sweat equity in so I'll show you the product when we're done with the mixing so after I finished mixing right here looks pretty like whipped it looks pretty creamy kind of cool like a spread for Philadelphia Cream Cheese but anyway I think I'm supposed to pour that into here but no no no that's right but I think I'm gonna do it that way cause that bowl is bigger we'll see how that works out came out of it pretty well use the handy dandy scooper right there now mixing this might be a little difficult it's kind of dry but see if we can get it to work with us we'll see all right that took a lot more effort than I thought it would but it's gonna be exciting got a compliments from my expert Baker over there that it looks good and now I can scoop it on to the what do you call this thing sheet pan pan sheet yeah all right they look pretty legit I'm not gonna lie looking pretty snazzy see they come out pretty good spinny Goldy Brown muffins ready I think it's like 45 minutes and they'll be done alrighty cuz we practice safety already pull that one going on for the next one and oh look at those oh yeah nice this is a big boys not a baker but my buns are hot also like Kathy said I test it out it's gonna be soft let's see oh yeah pretty soft crunchy on the inside there's that is for more one bite everybody knows rules amazing you guys you have to try this", "TJTfX-b14oA": "You know those chocolate cookies that are extra dark and rich and they look just like they came from that fabulous bakery or coffee shop that you love to go to. But they don't always have the flavor that you're hoping for? Well, this month's cookie is gonna knock those out of the park. They look just like a pastry shop's, but they have amazing flavor and really give you that chocolate punch you're looking for. It is a rich delicious fudgy chocolate cookie. To start off, you just wanna melt your chocolate with a little bit of butter. Just put it in the microwave for about thirty second increments, stirring it intermittently. Once it's melted, set it aside and let it cool slightly and then start with your batter. Next, add your softened butter with your brown sugar and white sugar into the mixer. Instantly, when you're putting brown sugar into a cookie recipe, you know they are gonna have great flavor. I love the slight hint of molasses it can add and it really adds a good fudgy texture because it has more moisture in it than white sugar. Cream that together longer than you think. A lot of times, people do not cream near long enough. I'm talking three or four minutes in your stand mixer. I know it sounds like a long time, and you probably think you do it, but set the timer for this one and you'll realize, wow, I don't cream long enough. And it really does make a difference. It will make them just an amazing texture and it's worth it - trust me. Once it's creamed, you can start adding your eggs one by one. Once again, I know this is one of those things we all read in a recipe and think \"ugh, who does that?\" Try it. They incorporate so much better. Break it into your bowl and then add it with the mixer running. And then on the last egg, I just add the yoke. The yoke is the fat that's in the egg and that adds a richness and it really gives the cookies that fudgy-ness you're looking for in the center. After your eggs are incorporated, you can add the vanilla. Vanilla is so important in chocolate. It really brings out those flavors of the chocolate even more than you think. When the vanilla is fully incorporated, you can add your slightly cooled melted chocolate to the mixer with the mixer running or off - it really doesn't matter. Just pour it into the mixer and then make sure it's fully incorporated. Next, you just wanna sift together your dry ingredients. I of course always use a larger strainer to do my sifting. Just place it into a bigger bowl and then put in your cocoa. Of course I'm using Dutch process here. That's what gives them their good, dark color and flavor. Then your flour, then your soda, and your salt. Just shake that out into the bowl. To finish this off, you can just add all your sifted dry ingredients. Turn the mixer on the lowest setting at first to make sure they incorporate or you are going to have a puff of cloud everywhere in front of you. Once it's fully incorporated, just clean off the beater and then by hand, fold in your white and dark chocolate chips. I love the mixture in these and it's really a classic combination to have the white chocolate chips in these dark chocolate cookies. Once they're folded in, you can just start scooping them out onto your prepared pans. The parchment paper makes for such easy cleanup and they really do bake great right on top. I like to make slightly larger cookies here because they give you that real, bakery look. Place the cookies into a preheated 350-degree oven and take them out when they're just slightly set around the edges when you touch them and puffed. As they cool, they're gonna fall on themselves and you're gonna get that fudgy, chewy center and the amazing chocolate punch you're looking for. These cookies really are one of my favorite and as you can see, I get so excited when I find a recipe that I love. Not only do they look great, but they taste amazing.

nerdy nummies cookbook the basic recipe and I wanted it to be perfect so every week I would do another batch of cookies and go hmm this one needs a little bit more salt this one needs more brown sugar

to give this video a thumbs up click subscribe and ring the bell to receive notifications every time I'll post a new video now let's make the best chocolate chip cookies ever let's get started for this chocolate chip cookie recipe I'm gonna be posting all of the ingredients and their measurements in the description down below so if you want to follow along at home ya KN all right first step to making these cookies very simple we're gonna mix together some dry ingredients in a medium bowl you're gonna combine your flour baking soda and salt so they're salty then whisk together until well combined alright it's well mixed now I'm gonna set this off to the side next in a big mixing bowl we're gonna cream together our butter sugar and a little bit of vanilla extract protip you want to make sure your butter is at room temperature it makes a big difference you want it really soft when you're creaming together your butter and sugars we're putting it two sticks of butter Steen tablespoons Oh worth it at granulated sugar brown sugar which is the most important ingredient when you're making chocolate chip cookies if you're not using brown sugar it in my opinion is not a chocolate chip cookie it just doesn't have that richness to it that like caramel II that like it's a sweet sugar with Sol this is what you want if you don't have this don't come to my house with chocolate chip cookies I mean I probably will have a few bites cuz I like cookies but I love brown sugar and a little bit of vanilla extract then you're gonna cream together until your mixture is light and fluffy I'm gonna be using an electric hand mixer just makes it a little bit easier than doing it by hand I'm gonna mix on a medium speed fun factoid side bar a road ramp the reason brown sugar is brown you know there's light brown sugar dark brown sugar is because it's made with molasses which is why it just tastes so good cuz molasses is what you use to make gingerbread cookies which are like one of the best cookies in the entire world and they just have that rich flavor it's almost just like caramel II like it's so good so light brown sugar has a little less molasses and then dark brown sugar has more I'm gonna get back to mixing here I just have some rogue brown sugar clumping together which it loves to do it's a little stickier so I'm just ready break it those up so I could get some light fluffy butter come on Molly this one's stubborn he's toss out the brown sugar never never I need every chunk of molasses I can get there was our molasses area it when you play candy cane that game molasses Mountain molasses Valley molasses let me know in the comments below if you know this your maybe will be Mike or Molly here they're looking it up on Google when you're playing the board game Candyland well is that little Mole this area called on like the original who's a molasses swamp swarm up with a guy named blobby oh he's terrifying bloppy looks kind of poopy I remember all of them being so cute he's a scary button what does he think moly show me a picture of this one licorice it's not interesting to you let me see gloppy looks adorable look at him he's cute okay we got to put a picture of gloppy up right here gloppy is so cute who's this licorice guy or talking about Oh Lord licorice he looks like a villain moly you'd probably date him in your bad-boy face I'm not saying Moe had bad taste in men I'm saying there weren't a lot of options available oh yeah I'm done I'm done oops I'm done spilling the tea and the cookie dough so let's get to mix it now Malik we get back to baking or whatever looking good look how light and fluffy this looks like a brown sugar butter cloud yeah I want to bathe it our sleeping a cuddle huh okay this is looking good also one more tangent I promise little baby gray is learning how to bake and it is so adorable so go check out my sister's Instagram it is so cute he's like one and a half and he's already making like little cupcakes and stuff he's baking with Grandma so cute it's adorable he's like a little baby Baker at the making and I love it okay so go check it out I'm keeping distracted by cute babies okay back to cookies back to kisses this is important now we're gonna add and mix in two full eggs the yolk and the egg white one at a time so you're gonna add one mix it up add the other one mix it up I did a double handed a crack because I don't want to mess these up at all hi Mike it's not worth the risk yeah you can't be too safe no one in time when time oh my gosh oh my god my nonno pilot oh my gosh I get to cracking eggs and you just can't stop me I'm just like Adam that was a close call I almost messed up my perfect cookie recipe thanks Mike oh my gosh here we go yeah honestly I gotta get that white in there a little bit of white fill in there buddy here we go again I'm gonna do a scrape down as well cuz I'm not messing around with these cookies for getting all those ingredients [Applause] this batter is looking great on a little speed while you're mixing slowly add in the dry ingredients I'm gonna do this with a little measure cup I'm not measuring anything I'm just using as a little scoop while I'm mixing just keep going until you've added all the flour and it's well combined well scoop mix it in this is to get the perfect consistency I also promise this is the only part in the recipe where you have to be a little patient but there's no decorating or anything so I think it all evens out well then our chocolate chips folding our chocolate chips folding our chocolate chips folding or chocolate chips so if you haven't guessed the next step is this is last step is to fold in our chocolate chips so just pour all of them into a big bowl then using a spatula or a large mixing spoon you're just gonna fold them in here's how you fold it's a little bit different than mixing we don't want to chop up our chocolate chips we want to keep them whole so we fold more gently so you're gonna take your spatula and go underneath the batter and then bring it over like so you and turn under over turn now you just keep doing this till all the chocolate chips are in the dough oh my gosh this smells and looks so good I just want to eat this Oh eating fresh cookie dough is one of my guilty pleasures I am restraining myself right now I'm not gonna do that today but I also have a delicious vegan cookie dough recipe and it's made so you can just eat them as little cookie don't Molly you remember that recipe oh they're so good yeah I don't want to blow my cup but Mike was like oh I don't want any vegan cookie dough that's not gonna taste good and he had one what blow him up oh my god okay I I was trying to say I didn't want to blow you up but oh my gosh so anyways I wasn't gonna blow my Cup but I'm doing it boom a little bit right now is I made vegan cookie dough and you're supposed to eat it in the little ball forms and Mike ate one he was like I guess these are okay I was like okay they're delicious and then I go to the fridge the next morning all twenty of them that I had in a little bag in the fridge gone Michael Beauty you ain't a half-eaten boss I don't even think that counts and I was like where did all these cookie balls go and Mike's like uh and I was like oh you loved him and he was like okay I liked him I liked oh my god might like to vegan recipe well don't worry Mike there's gonna be play more where that came from in the future but today classic the best chocolate chip cookies ever made so you'll just have to settle for this oh my gosh what happened here get in the bowl we can't have this yeah what did you guys think I said blow my gut we need a replay we need an instant replay like a referee like in sport games we need to really review the footage did I say I don't want to blow my cup but or did I say I don't want to blow my gut but I don't want to blow my cup but blow my cup but you guys are messed up okay I don't think I said that I don't think I said that we all miss her d twice well you know what then it's just like my fault like I can't talk like my communicating is so bad that you don't actually know what I'm saying we were like perfect give this girl baking show we can't understand her oh yeah our chocolate-chip cookie dough is totally ready to bake now we're gonna scoop 2 tablespoons of the dough onto a baking sheet and woah I usually don't do this but we're gonna be scooping them onto an ungreased baking sheet now I want to emphasize that these are nonstick sheets if you don't have non-stick sheets I would advise putting down a piece of parchment paper but because these are nonstick sheets no grease needed these cookies have enough butter they grease themselves and I love it I scooped 2 tablespoons about 2 inches apart leave some room because they will expand also this recipe makes about 3 dozen chocolate chip cookies and it makes so many because everybody wants one and you run out anyways you make this and then everyone's like well where'd all the cookies go and I think that's a great question y'all where did all the cookies go so that's why I've made so many of this one cuz it's good the scoop that I'm using is 2 tablespoons so I just scoop it up and get off the excess cuz I don't know about you but in our house if someone got a bigger cookie than someone else it's a big deal alright got our little quickie you're just gonna fill up your tray boom Minnelli's delicious cookies are ready to bake you're gonna heat your oven to 375 degrees and bake for about 7 to 9 minutes they bake fast so keep your eye on them and every ovens a little bit different you want to watch them and as soon as they turn a little bit golden brown they're ready once your cookies have baked you're gonna let your cookies sit on the tray for one minute to cool and while they're on here they're gonna continue to bake and you'll see a little bit of color difference over here this is the perfect color that you your cookie when you remove them from the oven you'll see it's a really light brown then as they cool like over here they get a little bit darker it's all about timing in my oven these cook for nine minutes but it really depends on your oven ovens are so different different brands how they're set up how they're ran so just keep your eye on it when they turn this color in the oven between seven and nine minutes perfect they have a little bit of crisp and softness you'll get the best of both worlds and they also deflate a little bit you'll see that they poof up when they bake and then as they're cooling they kind of just go down a little bit and tada there you have it the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe a big thank you to you guys for suggesting a simple delicious at-home

sorry cuz these are delicious", "1Zv4oRaPaWI": "- Today we're gonna be making\nthese dreamy, decadent, but super easy peanut butter\nchocolate chip cookies. They have the perfect\namount of everything. They're basically fool-proof. And I don't know if you can\nsee, but there's this sparkle of giant flakes of sea salt on top and it is making all of your\ncookie dreams come true. You gotta believe me on this. Okay, let's get started. First off, we're gonna\nsift the dry ingredients starting with 2-1/4\ncups or about 270 grams of all-purpose flour. There we go. It's close. 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda. I'm adding in 1/2 a teaspoon of salt now, but we're gonna garnish this cookie with beautiful flakes\nof sea salt at the end so you will get a nice, salty finish. Sift it up (upbeat music) and give it a quick whisk. Okay, now we can set that\naside and get onto the butter, and peanut butter, and\nall that gooey goodness. Into the bowl of my stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment I'm adding in one cup, which is two\nsticks, or about 230 grams of unsalted room-temperature butter. In you go. Cream it up for like a few seconds. Now we're gonna add in a cup and 1/2 of smooth peanut butter. And I will give you some advice. Use the regular, like supermarket brand. It has a lot of emulsifiers\nand other ingredients in there that'll make it a bit more stable. This is gonna be a little\nsoupy, but it'll all work out, so don't worry. And by my measurement, a\ncup and 1/2 of peanut butter is about 260 grams. Okay, mix. I would eat this just like that, like with a spoon. That is some delicious business. Okay, so thanks to my\nglass bowl, you can see there's a little bit of\nbutter at the very bottom. Just scrape it down. This recipe uses 3/4 of a\ncup of light brown sugar, so just tap it down. You're actually packing it a little bit. Lightly packed brown sugar. And then 2/3 of a cup of granulated sugar. So in you go. You might know this, but white sugar will make the cookies spread out more and the brown sugar will\nmake it a little bit (sighing) cakier. No! (off-air beep) Cakier. No one saw that. Mix it. It'll get a little bit\nlighter and fluffier. The peanut butter is\nweighing it down, though. If you make peanut butter\ncookies, you know this already, but adding more peanut\nbutter will increase the peanut butter flavor\nand also make them, like, just super crispy like they're\ngonna dissolve in your mouth. Less peanut butter,\nclearly less the flavor, but the cookies will\nbe a bit stronger, too. Less crumbly. (mixer motor) Okay, take a look. A little bit lighter in color. Little creamier. Mm. Now we're gonna add in two\nteaspoons of vanilla extract, one large egg to start. Mix 'er up and then we'll\nadd in the second large egg. Gonna scrape the bowl down really quickly and then we can add\nour dry ingredients in. And this cookie's almost ready to eat. Now, add your dry ingredients in. You can do it, you can do it all at once. Good. Mix on low until you're confident bad things won't happen. Okay, look at that. Now it's a dough. But what could make this even better? How 'bout some chocolate chips? I'm adding a cup and 1/2 of semi-sweet chocolate chips in. If you want to use milk\nchocolate, that's on you. I will have the dark. I'm gonna mix this for like a few seconds and then fold it in by hand. (mixer motor) (light-hearted music) Okay. Oh my, this smells so good. In fact, let's take a little test. Oh man. It's so good. So good! Oh, okay. This will be delicious. And I'll be right back with the swap out that I made yesterday. All right, back with my chilled dough and I'm using a regular-size\nice cream scoop. I'll measure it out in a second in grams in case you're a Virgo like me and you like things to be exact. Just scoop out the chilled dough, pop it out, and then\nwe have about 50 grams. Look at this. Where are my chocolate chips? They're all hiding inside. But don't worry. We're gonna fix it and\nmake it look really cute. Just continue. You want to space them out. They will be spreading. So I like to do kind of\nrows of two or three. So these cookies are a mixed bunch. Some of them are covered in chocolate. Some of them have almost none. I want them to be uniform\nand look really pretty, so pop in a couple of\nchocolate chips to the top, maybe like three to\nfour, and just put them in different orientations. You can press a few in. The main thing is that you're gonna have some of the chocolate that's fully exposed and not covered with any batter, so it'll look nice and\nglossy once they bake. And no one ever sad, \"Too\nmuch chocolate,\" right? These cookies are looking way better, but for my final blogger\ntrick, I'm gonna use some Maldon sea salt. I'm not getting paid for this at all, so don't worry, it's not sponsored. But this salt is bananas. It has huge crystals in\nit which look beautiful on all sorts of dishes. Look at that salt crystal. It's like a giant roof\nshingle that's in this bag. And the science teacher in me loves seeing the crystalline structure. It's a, it's a, it's a pyramid. (chuckling) That's what it is. It's a regular, old, square pyramid. Okay, anyways, now we're\ngoing to gracefully add on just a sprinkle on top. The salt will not melt, so you'll have some beautiful flakes. And the other thing I like about this is it's paper thin. So even though the salt crystals are huge, you're not biting into\na giant chunk of salt. It really is a perfect\ncompliment for this recipe. All right, this is gonna go into the oven at 350, about 177 Celsius, for, mmm, maybe 13 to 15 minutes\nbecause you want them to start setting but not be fully baked. They're gonna spread out\nand they'll dome a bit, but once you take them out\nof the oven, they'll flatten and be a beautiful cookie\nwith a velvety finish. It'll be magic. Let's make this happen. But wait, there's more. Mm mm. (chuckling) I told you that if you\nuse more peanut butter, you get more flavor, but it is more, it doesn't have the structure. So it's a trade off. These are delicious, but they\nwill start falling apart, especially if you just\nhit them with a heat gun right before this shot because\nyou wanted the chocolate to look extra glossy in the closeup. If you like this video, check\nout my number-two-by-a-hair, these would be number\none, favorite cookie, chocolate chocolate chip. So delicious and good. And if you want the classics, chewy chocolate chips over here. Those are really like a crowd pleaser. But these guys are number one.

subscribed to my youtube channel be sure to tap that subscribe button see you the first to see my only videos if you've never tried cake mix cookies before all you need is a box of cake mix and four ingredients it's so easy and they're not tasty at all they have this like soft chewy cookie texture so we're mixing bowl we're just going to mix together one box of strawberry cake mix 1/3 cups of vegetable oil 2 large eggs and if you spoon of vanilla extract and we're just going to beat this all together until it's well combined then we're going to mix in one cup with the 6 ounces a white chocolate chip now I love the combination of the white chocolate and the strawberry kind of play on a strawberries and cream but I've also made these using semi-sweet chocolate chips I'd even sprinkles so these are really versatile if you guys give them a try be sure to tag me in a picture on social media at Lindsey and base let me know what kind of flavor combinations you guys came up with alright now we're going to scoop our dough into little balls about two tablespoons each onto a baking sheet now we're gonna pop these in the fridge for about an hour so the dough has a chance to firm up a little bit so it doesn't spread too much as the cookies bake the monster dough is nice confirm we're just gonna pop these in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 9 to 11 minutes or until the edges just start to set look at how perfect these cookies came out they're so gorgeous and totally look like they came from a gourmet bakery let's go ahead and break one of these open oh look how soft and chewy these are okay I cannot wait to try one of these mmm these are so soft you guys and the only one tastes like cake I thought a chewy cookie with that subtle strawberry flavor and I am obsessed with white chocolate if you like white chocolate you are going to love this flavor combination mmm [Music] mmm cakes cookies are virtually foolproof and knowing on any of you totally cheated

tons more that I know you're going to love and I'll see you guys next time bye [Music] [Music] [Music]", "kxmrjO3WflM": "mmm they're so good [Music] hey what's up guys it's a gosh Alena and I'm back with a new video today I am in my kitchen and I'm actually not in my kitchen to show you guys some sneakers or some clothes today we are doing something in the kitchen and that is baking cookies and I know it's a very hard time right now we are like days six seven eight of isolation I lost count with staying in want to be healthy I hope you're doing the same guys and yeah I'm actually here to keep you guys away from all the news from all the madness that is going on so I was thinking let's bake some cookies and I actually put them up on my instant story the other day and loads of you guys wanted to have a recipe for it start sinking actually let me shoot a video for it I'm still in my pajamas like my daily where I'm gonna be comfortable today we are baking white chocolate macadamia nut cookies I am loving the ones on subway at this particular time we can get into subway I mean it's still open but I just preferred to not go into any restaurant at the moment and but I was thinking I need to eat them not want to have them now and it was a fight to even get flour but yeah let me not talk too much let's get straight to the video what we need to bake these white chocolate macadamia nut cookies is flour you also need some light brown sugar we also need some granulated sugar a little bit of baking soda some vanilla extract some white chocolate chips then we also had some macadamia nuts I actually chopped these macadamia nuts up I bought them in horse but it was still a bit too big for these cookies and we need an egg y'all know what it's like and we also need some butter and beside of that you only need a sprinkle of side so before we mix all of the ingredients together we have to preheat our oven and I'm doing this now so I'm putting it on the fan setting and on 180 degrees for everyone in the UK I'm gonna write down how it is for the people in the u.s. to mix everything together you need oh of course and you need a mixer sancho a KitchenAid I know but for now we move what we have so the oven is preheating and we're starting with the dough now and mix it in the butter and the sugar we also need a brown sugar and now it's actually time for the egg I also have like one to two teaspoons of the vanilla extract I love me some vanilla and now we're adding some baking soda flour and with everything sweet you also need a sprinkle of salt for the perfect taste and now it's time to finally put in the Mahama nuts and also the white chocolate and when the cookie dough has this consistency then you know it is time to form the ball and create some nice cookies now we need to roll the balls for the cookies and yes they flatten themselves so you don't need to worry about that hands are clean ready to touch the dough to make this a little bit easier I'm using two spoons one two just yeah get into the scoop and then place it onto here yet it just makes it easier and they roughly all have the same size [Music] now that everything is evenly placed obviously I cannot just put an oven like that we need to roll them nicely like a little yeah like a little ball and give them a little bit of space because you know you want them to spread if this though it obviously depends on how you roll them out I have 16 cookies I'm sure you can't even get 20 out of them if you make them a bit smaller I like mine medium size and now it's time to finally put them in the oven only 10 minutes and then they're done because what I can guarantee you guys with these cookies is that they are crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside and that's what we love 10 minutes are over so it's time to take them out Wow they are looking amazing when you actually take them out of the oven they're gonna be very soft so you would probably think they're not done yet because if I touch it now it is very soft in the middle because like I said the middle gonna be chewy and the outside is crispy so now it's time to let them cool off don't want to take them off the tray when they're hot because they will be sticking to it so just give these a rest and do not be greedy and touch them in a minute because I always have to tell Patrick don't touch the cookies don't touch them let me just see if they have been poisoned or something [Music] let's focus on these I must admit I broke one already because I just needed to see from the inside I haven't tasted them yet which I'm going to do now I approximately waited for 20 minutes for them to cool off because I still like them warm but it's not let me actually taste them out mmm their full mouth but they are so good they come pretty pretty close to the subway ones I'm actually happy that summer 2020 has been postponed because while I'm being in isolation yeah you can imagine how many cookies I'm worried and that was it guys that was today's video of these weather nicest white chocolate macadamia nut cookies ever but let me know in the comments if you would actually like to see more cooking or baking

these times and bake them as well and then I can only say make sure to LIKE and subscribe make sure to follow me on all my social media accounts and then I'll see you guys in my next video bye bye [Music]", "EiJ4hCGwa10": "[Music] hi everyone and welcome back to crumbs and doilies and the cupcake Gemma Channel and today I've got another really exciting recipe for you guys it is another cookie and by the time you watch this you'll have some kit already online on the cupcakes on the website I have a little cookie friend that I normally do this with and I really really miss him so this isn't gonna be exactly like baking me Dane but I would like to introduce to you all through the power of the internet it's really excited about this it's not quite the same as me doing an hour in the kitchen with you but we're gonna make some cookies it's gonna be amazing so I sent you the raspberry white chocolate kit did you get it yes happiness okay we're just gonna look you guys through this we're gonna have a little cat tape as we go and it's gonna be super fun we're gonna eat some cookies so let's have a look what's in our book who's got the recipes as usual we're gonna start off with our sugar and our butter Jane's got his sugar there yes pretty soon you're gonna open up I figure and we're gonna put that straight into your mixer or your bowl whatever you're choosing to use and don't worry we'll put and the full ingredient City cookies in the description box below so if you don't have the kit you can still bake along with us so your sugars in Jogja take it in what's next back there that's alright yep lovely and as usual it needs to be nice and cold straight from the fridge and we've chopped it up into little chunks so that's gonna go into our mixes a straizo okay right so first stage is to mix these two ingredients up so we're just gonna put them at the mixer work around the other way arms like a really low medium speed and what we're looking for we're looking for that kind of know that such sugary buttery goodness perfect so nope you know within just nugget so turn your mixers and go it's not gonna take very long is it like I think mine is lifting nearly there so I'm gonna turn mine off Jane's still going a bit I'm just going to show you what we mean by kind of sugary festering nuggets they all kind of different sizes yeah and this all kind of goes towards making these nice and chunky when the page and they kind of tear apart really easily as well so let's have a look you got your nuggets yeah he have got his blood all right next up is our Edition and so first of all is the chocolate chips like all the kits you I mean you can't have a cookie that chocolate I don't think no Teddy crap for this one obviously it's advised to be white chocolate say we've got white chocolate chip but yeah we like to just take things a little bit further and we have caramelized half of the chocolate because we just kind of obsessed with this stuff it's just the best it's like liquid gold it's like liquid gold if you've got yours there then yeah no loose rose so we've done a hundred and fifty grams which is half of the white chocolate and in the kit you've got this M little recipe card here and but we're lot of bits and links to some videos because I have mine in the microwave but you don't have a microwave so what did you do no I did not only took about 40 minutes 40 minutes of imperfect it's really easy to do it just takes a little bit of time but it's so worth it it's like yeah I mean I could eat that so let's start by paying half of the chocolate chips from the kit into the mixer I'm gonna do props that will do and obviously we need to chop the caramelized chocolate up so Dane is already off on his he's chopped up so we're gonna do some nice big chunks and say Dane tell us what you've been up to in lockdown the Dane basically been in lockdown for like a month now right yeah it's been 47 days this oh my gosh that's actually longer than a month yeah then try to keep myself busy work now sporadically baking cookies every birthday oh my gosh I saw ya on Instagram it looks incredible yes so edit for I have two of them so that makes thirteen ones yeah it looks so good did you put it have you saved it have you got on your Instagram yeah I sewed on my highlights so cool and so make sure you follow Dane I'll put his them Instagram thing on the screen right about now I would say at Dane perfect and go over and have a look at it because it was it looked exquisite right so um caramelized chocolate going into the mix yeah mm-hmm just limits and then oh not ready no obviously this is raspberry white chocolate so we have some raspberries so in the kit we've got des a little packet of oh my god okay so this is raspberries and which they're just so like kind of fragrant and really tang and yeah so it's like the perfect way of getting the rusty flavor into your cookies and you could do this with freshmen today right yeah if you have a freeze-dried we kind of hold them fresh or if you've got frozen recipes would be good just get this kind of gooey pockets of a brass penis which I love a little oh yeah exactly it'll just be a little bit wet a bit these are gooey cookies anyway so a little bit of a wet raspberries perfect right so we're gonna tip all of those in there as well and they're also gonna make this go a bit kind of pinky it's gonna look beautiful guys so mixers back down and we're gonna just mix that for like 30 seconds just to kind of spread it nice and evenly throughout the batter say ready yes we go just smells so good it just like a little puff of like rods for you mister they're not very long at all and then that's going up and you can already see it looks I just look stunning it looks so pretty very pretty right what's next flower super happy flower mix and so in here you've got your flour salt and raising agent so you don't need to worry about anything with these it's basically done it also you we're gonna tip all of your flour into the mixing bowl if you have a stand mixer this is gonna make it a whole lot easier for you but you don't have to have one you can do this by hand yeah we do know I do the baking along with my friends over FaceTime ah two of them didn't have mixers so they sniff I handle the wooden spoon and got their hands in there as well good point actually you could just use your hands like kind of rubbing it a bit like pastry right yeah yes Oh with the Whizzer like a thing so right anyway mixes that down and we're just gonna again keep on a low speed so all the way through recipe is no and it's nice and quick we're not whipping beating or anything and what we're looking for here is like a fine breadcrumbs and again it's not gonna take very large ready ready he's ready let's go Dane I have to say I'm loving the hair growth I love it he's a little bit different so it's kind of attracting it's like whoa what's they gonna look like today change many modes your leg bone semi Yeah right anyway let's show you guys what this mixes will be looking like now so you can see it's really trying to find breadcrumb e-type situation going on here and that's you know those kind of dry and you know things normally when you're baking shouldn't be dry but we want it to be dry right now and now it's time to bind it all together which we're gonna do through the power of eggs good legs it's good as egg so we're gonna go for two eggs don't worry about the size I know eggs are one of those things that's a little bit hard to get hold of at the moment yeah cool little store Oh No yeah so mine are quite little eggs but yeah - you know whatever side you get hold of are gonna eat the rate so I'm crashing them into a separate Bowl and we're just gonna whisk those together a little bit first again that this just means that we don't need to keep the mixer on for too long so it's just gonna be enough so kind of binds it all together your frames wispy accent like I mean I let me use the smaller bowl perfect as usual making it hard right extra-nice and beans together and they're gonna get into the mixer and then all we need to do is turn them on on the low-speed again and we're just going to bind it all together right yeah okay so on they go and you just want to keep this mixing it so as it forms a bit of a stir and it kind of and the sides of the spa's I'm a bit clean so yeah that's my flower movement and it's cool yeah exactly so don't worry it doesn't like it coming together you can just kind of squish it with your hands at the end but mine is looking pretty good it's probably because I saw Gemma's a wonderful mixer for doing this but if you're thinking of getting yourself a mix there and but you're not really sure what one to get or how much you want to spend then demo down and I just left her with you easily Janie is actually using the one that he reviewed and I leave some demos because it's just so pretty and I love it and I'm really jealous and she's not here to tell me not to yeah yeah very tired okay right so cookie dough it's done it looks amazing you can see here it's this really lovely kind of pink color and it's got the little nuggets of the raspberries in there as well it's smells incredible now it's time to make the balls let's have a look show us your hands it's clubs done and we love seeing that you guys are actually wearing your gloves tear laugh think you've all gone out right so we're gonna weigh these they're real nice we want to make them as you know professional as we can so we're gonna go for a hundred gram balls but yes and if you like them slightly bigger when we were in the shop we do engine 25 so I yeah so if you want to figure if you go for that yeah okay on the scales the crimson joy is just before we close to it all this went on you might have got some yourself that's so true they were like the last thing that we kind of came up with just before lockdown happened yes and they were amazing actually I'm so glad that we could eat them again I'm going to start weighing mine and then once they either wage and you probably already know but if you don't we need to freeze them because they're going to bake a lot better from frozen it's going to keep them nice and gooey on the inside and nice and kind of plump as well so we say you know minimum of like two hours but the best thing about these cookies is that you can just keep them in your freezer and then when you can't see a cookie you can just get 100 degrees and bake it like having cookies on tap all the time yeah in lockdown when you've been working background yeah it's very well it's kind of obviously very different to what it used to be like it comes and bears oh there's like six of us at the moment because we're obviously selling all the kits from the merch online which has been amazing and it's been so like it's just been so kind of lovely and heartwarming to see how many of you guys at home are kind of supporting us and buying the kit so there's me obviously and and we've got Sam who is co-owner of crumbs and doilies okay didn't know with Gemma he's like the whiz kid isn't he he's like yeah who's behind Taleb right I can see him it's funny because I can see baby this little screen here and then we've got Carly who usually in old days would be running our office on our website and you just know is doing all that stuff but she's also helping us out in the bakery and we've Rosie who is the kitchen manager here at once where is Rosie yeah it's lovely to have Rosie and then we've got Kirsty and Roz who are two of our lovely wonderful bakers and cake decorators they know it's a good team yeah very smoothly yeah it has I mean at first few were a little bit like whoa what are we doing [Laughter] it's been a switch like I miss everyone so much like I miss you and Nicky and Emma and like the whole kitchen gang and all the guys at the shop but you know at least we do get to henna hang out with the six of us eat today FaceTime right are you will bald a no-bull a bit sneaky and I left some cameras behind that is such a good Ted what are you doing that's what you're doing then I literally had the ball like this I'm just kind of making an imprint with my phone popping the chocolate in and just wrapping it back around oh my god guaranteed a doozie sense no chocolate he's full of it upstairs that's why we miss the room we need him right so they're all made so are we gonna put these in the freezer and then when you're ready to bake them what you need to do is heat your oven to 180 degrees C so it's nice and hot and you want to put a baking tray in there with some baking paper on it if you've got the kit we've provided you with two sheets of baking paper and and you want to put that in like five minutes you ready to bake that way when you put your balls of cookie dough in the bottom it's going to get really nice and crispy as well so the whole of the outsides gonna be crispy and the middle to be gooey and then you put them in the oven that's 14 minutes I'm until they're nice and golden on top and then let them cool down just a little bit I like getting them warm I know some people actually like them cold like Carly who's here yes who likes in the next day when they kind of like cooled down and gone a bit like gooey oh yeah so whatever you like and then so we're gonna go and bake them have a little clean down we'll have a cup of tea to catch up you back here in like half an hour with some delicious warm gooey gooey raspy white chocolate cookies all right get on in the oven see you in a bit [Laughter] okay so their cookies are out of the oven they look incredible they smell incredible this is all very exciting but believe it

[Music] you [Music]", "SLYCFVJ1k1g": "hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to share with you my strawberry white chocolate chip cookies they're so good they are so easy and since the brighter months are amongst us that figure I would share with you a cookie recipe that wasn't sort of cinnamony and more dense that I normally would show you in the winter months so this recipe it just requires handful of really basic ingredients like all-purpose flour some salt baking soda gray and a sugar brown sugar white chocolate chips some chopped up fresh strawberries I'm salted butter that's been softened to room temperature some orange zest vanilla paste and an egg that's it first thing you want to do is the oven preheated to 375 get a couple baking sheets line them with some parchment paper and get the ready and now I'm going to make mine in my standing mixer but you could do this by hand of course and let's get started I'm going to cream together my butter make sure your butter is at room temperature because otherwise it's not going to cream and both kinds of sugar I'm going to bring that up and I'm going to cream that well and while that happens I are just going to get rid of this I'm going to zest a half of an orange zest it's at the other half for another recipe so this is perfect now I'm going to add in my egg and my insists the zest of my orange half of my orange add that in there and I'm going to add some vanilla paste now you can use vanilla extract of course but I'm going to use vanilla paste because it's got like that the chalk the white chocolate just complements it really really well so that's why I'm adding this animal I'm running low so I need to order some more I usually order mine online because I don't I can't find it in my local supermarket so anyways get that in there a quick little scrape with my spatula just around the sides to make sure it's all incorporated well and I'm going to just mix this until it's combined looking good I'm adding in my dry ingredients and I'm just going to mix that in until it's combined and what I mean by that is all right got a lot of emails like what does it mean when you say I just added in to this much you don't want this again once you see that the flour is incorporated it doesn't mix thing I know that sometimes people even though the flour is incorporated they just let it mix I'm going to mix the lemon but you don't want to do that because you create a tough cookie that way so this is nearly there I'm just going to do that for one second and I'm going to add in my white chocolate chips and my chopped up strawberries all right mix those in just really briefly and now you're pretty much better just gonna use my ice cream scoop to scoop out my cookies oh my baking sheets and you want to scoop these out a couple inches apart from each other last one I'm gonna pop these into the oven that's been preheated to 375 for 9 to 11 minutes or until they're lightly golden and then we're gonna let them cool completely and dig in my cookies were in the oven for 11 minutes now these are not going to be like really hard and crisp because of the fresh strawberries there's a lot of moisture on them it's going to keep the cookies much to your much softer but they just have a very delicate flavor to them which I really really love delicate flavor and also I don't know which one I want to pick up here a delicate flavor and a delicate texture as well look at that I just love that I love that fresh berry right there they're absolute dynamite a strawberry is so it's so true like it's not I'm an artificial strawberry flavor it's just a fresh strawberry flavor for the sweetness from the white chocolate that's really balanced well with the slight tartness of the fresh berry because of white chocolate as we all know can be a bit too sweet but this is perfectly balanced they're not too sweet of a cookie they're very delicate I just think you're a winner all around a little are in the kitchen uncommon to get this recipe I hope that you remain calm and I hope that you enjoy them as much as we do I know that I have made these before with tons of different variations of berries one of my favorites is strawberries and then there's also I put blackberries in them as well I assure that with you in a different recipe but these are absolutely delicious la reina get to know combo has the recipe I hope you've enjoyed spending time with me and I will see this time you you", "vOpJRoucH9I": "- Today we're making a delicious, super easy cookie that\ncomes together in a snap. You are going to flip out for this. There's tons of white\nchocolate chips in here, and a lot of crushed candy cane, and it melts into this gooey\namazingness in the oven, and then hardens back up for\na wonderful crunch and snap. Okay, let's get started. We're adding our dry\ningredients into a bowl, I'm sifting it kind of optional, you could just whisk\nit up if you want, but, 150 grams or one and a quarter\ncups of all purpose flour, to begin with. I love using a scale because\nthere's a couple less dishes, for me to wash, 150 Exactly. Beside quarter teaspoon of baking soda, and a nice pinch of salt. Give that sugar some contrast, sift it up. If you want to add a little\nbit of cinnamon or all spice, or nutmeg, feel free. Whisk it up, and we're going to set aside, and cream that butter and sugar together. One half a cup of butter\nunsalted room temperature, into a standing mixer fitted\nwith a paddle attachment, but if you don't have one\nyou can use a hand mixer too, not a big deal. Just cream it up. If you want to make a double\nbatch of these cookies, it'll actually be easier\nbecause more butter, creams up more easily and\nyou'll have more cookies to eat. Alright, one half a cup of\nsugar into the stand mixer now. Beat It tells light and fluffy You'll prescribe ball down,\nscrape, scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape. Now we're going to continue mixing, and add one room temperature again. So graceful, so elegant. Okay. Mix it until it's Incorporated. scrape, scrape, scrape Now for the flavorings\nadd in half a teaspoon, maybe a whole if you\nreally want to go there. A vanilla extract, so as half\na teaspoon of vanilla extract, then a quarter teaspoon\nof peppermint extract. I like to have a nice\nminty kiss to the cookie< but not like a breath mints. It's like a little bit. it's very powerful stuff. That looks beautiful (mumbles). Now it's time to add in our flower slowly. Fish. Don't let that mixer\ngo too fast on lo que, do some housekeeping over here. I know that there's like a\nscraper paddle attachment, that people are recommending\nand I want to buy it. But I've just been very forgetful. It's the holidays and I'm in overdrive. Okay. That's coming together. Now we have to add in those\nwhite chocolate chips. Delicious. So now time for three quarters of a cup, about white chocolate chips. I'm using these giant big ones, they're really pretty and you go. You could also add in some\nchopped either toasted walnuts, or toasted pecans that would be delicious, and give you a really beautiful\nbit of crunch but not today. Okay, that's all mixed in\njust like for a second. Okay, transfer this into\nlike some plastic wrap, and just chill it. The last step before we chill our dough, is to fold in some of\nthis crushed candy cane. So here's what we're gonna do. Add them into a plastic bag\nor you take the wrappers off. You can seal it up or just fold it over. Now, get that aggression out or just start smashing. so satisfying. Okay, pretty good. So now we'll Measure out about half a cup. And we're gonna have a\nlittle bit extra to dip them, in at the end right before\nthey go into the oven. It's like that beauty little\ncheat shot that everyone uses, the chocolate chips\nreport with you on top. Same deal with this white peppermint. This is going to look so festive. Sprinkle that in there. That made me happy just seeing that folded in. I'm gonna transfer those to chill, for maybe like 10 or 20 minutes. You actually don't have to do that, you can go straight to scooping\nit onto the baking sheet, and then chill it's up to you. You could also just\nput this in the fridge, forget about it for a few days, and have delicious cookies at the ready, into the fridge. We'll be back in a moment. My dough chilled out. I did some dishes. Let's get to scooping, evil ice cream scoop. It is amazing. It will get a little messy. An warning you. Cookie ball dip. That's all you need. Plop it in there. Listen to repeat the process\nuntil all of your cookies, are rolled out. But you could totally save\nsome batter for later. You don't have to make them all now. Last one in. Okay, isn't a bake for maybe\nlike six or seven minutes, at 350 really fast, and you\nhave to wait until they are set, before you take them\noff of the baking sheet, otherwise they'll break. Okay, into the oven. Out of the oven and they're\nlooking totally delicious, but I want them to be really round. So here is the blogger's trick. Use our circle cutter. You're gonna place it over\nhere and just tighten them up, really quickly. Just shape them up. And everyone will be impressed. None the wiser about this whole\nmisshapen cookie situation. You have to work really quickly. Some of these are not\ngoing to be saveable. Sorry, cookies. Okay, I'm\npretty happy with that. Okay, cookies are shaped\nup, let them cool. In the meantime, you\ncan snack on this very, very hot cookie shard and just be patient, because if you try and lift\nthem up they'll just fall apart, they have to set they have to\nbe totally room temperature, not warm. Otherwise Let's be really\nmalleable and break apart. That's tasty. Okay, these are just ready. I'm cheating and I like lifted\nthat silicon baking mat up, so I can like pry the cookie\noff without breaking it, because I'm totally not patient enough, to wait the whole period of\ntime you're supposed to wait. By the way those silicone\nbaking sheets are so handy, I have so Pat's but you can get any brand, they really just help the\ncookie not brown too much, on the bottom. They lift off really\neasily every single time. Okay. Appears that was so just so good. (laughs) The white chocolate is\nlike gooey and molten, and the candy cans are really crunchy, with like a little minty kiss. This cookie is all of your\nholiday dreams come true, except the presence that you\nwanted that no one by you. Alright, thanks so much for watching. I hope you get a chance\nto make this recipe.

dark chocolate chunk cookies there are many chocolate chip cookie recipes out there but I have slowly tweaked this recipe so that it has the perfect texture in my mind at least for a chocolate chip cookie it's thin and flat but it's not so thin that its crispy all the way through it's just a little bit crisp on the edges it's chewy in the middle it's not cakey at all and it uses chocolate chunks both white and dark chocolate and each adds a different type of experience but together it creates this cookies and cream type of effect so I just sharpened my knife it's gonna make this a lot easier and I'm gonna cut about 1/2 cup of each of these types of chocolate the reason why I love doing chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips is because you get all these little craggy pieces and it really distributes throughout the cookie in a different way because chocolate chips really hold their shape as they bake you want to end up with about a half cup of each of these so I'm probably good here get going on my dark chocolate and this is where a sharp knife really comes in handy because the dark chocolate a little bit harder to cut I have a 1/2 cup or 1 stick of unsalted butter in my bowl here and I've softened it to room temperature so if you press it with your finger tip it should smush down a little bit I'm going to add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar to this as well as a 1/2 cup of packed light brown sugar and if you have the dark brown sugar you can definitely use that you can use a hand mixer to cream this together on medium high speed until it's combined after about a minute that should be combined I'm going to add one large egg and I'm also gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla extract we're gonna mix those in now Rach that looks whipped and beautiful so for our dry ingredients I've got one and a half cups of all-purpose flour and I'm going to add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt I'm gonna whisk that together to combine I'm gonna take my dry ingredients add them to the wet and we're going to mix that together until it's almost combined and when the flower has almost disappeared that's when you want to add in your chocolate got the dark and white and now we can finish fully mixing this together and the reason I do that is because I don't want the cookies to be over mixed at all we don't want tough cookies okay beautiful this is definitely a type of cookie dough that you just want to straight-up eat out of the bowl we are in the homestretch I've got a large cookie scoop here and I just love using these so make sure that all the cookies are the exact same size and I'm just going to drop scoops down onto a silicone mat lined baking sheet you can also do parchment paper so these are gonna go in a 350 fahrenheit oven for 13 to 15 minutes until they're slightly golden brown on the edges and they flattened out cookies once the cookies have finished baking you want to let them sit for just a couple of minutes so that when you go to pick one up it doesn't fall apart in your hands it has a chance to set and hold together give this a taste and of all the texture of this cookie is insane the exterior is nice and crisp but the middle is just a little bit under baked so it has this chewy resistance to it you seriously I just want to close your eyes as you sink your teeth into this cookie it's so good well I hope you guys enjoyed learning how to make this recipe and of course I hope you give it a try make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out on the new keeps your recipe videos thanks for watching and I'll see you

said these are requests but I'm not sure they'll make it to their destination but because they're going to my my nephew's wife she really wanted some so I'm gonna make her a batch of these and pack them up as a gift and for her and her beautiful little daughter and her her her husband which is my nephew they requested these so I'm gonna make them up some cookies and I wanted to share this with you guys so let's get started okay first I'm gonna start out with 2 sticks of softened butter please bring it to room temperature don't microwave it because if you get it too soft you're gonna have runny dough all over your your cookie sheet wondering why are my cookies looking like pancakes don't don't melt the butter just take it out of probably a few hours before you're gonna start these cookies up let it come to room temperature and getting fairly stuff but anyway we're gonna start with the two sticks of butter real butter I always can't stress it enough I guess I always say real butter I don't cook with margarine and but I just like butter real butter but if it's margarine or preference by all means use it and I'm going to add to that a cup of brown sugar I'm going to add 1/2 a cup of white granulated sugar and if you have your mixer go ahead and bring it out but as I've said before I like to do it by hand I don't like those big bulky machines so I'll mix this up hmm maybe a minute just to get it all combined it and then we'll get our flour our dry mixture started on this and let me get this beat up for a few minutes and we'll be right back okay we've got it all mixed up I mixed it up maybe maybe a minute just till it's creamed real good night or two and then from there I'm going to add two whole eggs and I'm gonna add a teaspoon well I usually just pour it in the cap here it's a teaspoon a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm going to add a teaspoon this one is butter vanilla butter vanilla but if you don't have any just use two teaspoons of regular vanilla I'll do a cap of that this is more of a oil and we will get this mixed up get these eggs mixed up in there as soon as I get this mixed up we'll get that flour and our other dry ingredients mixed up okay one more thing I forgot just do a good cap full of some canola oil this helps thin it then up thee because sometimes it's just too thick so a little bit of canola oil helps it along without having to add more butter so I usually add a good cap of that in there with that okay we got that all mixed up this is our wet ingredients I'm gonna set this aside here and we're gonna get it all dry ingredients going here now I'm gonna put in three cups just remember don't pack it lighten it up here three cups of all-purpose flour leveled make it a mess here I just filled my container up here okay I'm lightly packing this okay there's three cups and a quarter cup of flour all right next I'm going to add in you couple tablespoons of cornstarch cornstarch what this does is it kind of helps soften your proteins gives you a more tender cookie so we'll do a couple tablespoons of that and we'll get this mixed up just until it's combined in okay and then I'm gonna add it to my wet mixture okay they should be mixed in all right so actually what I did here guys I used the wrong bowls this was supposed to be here well we'll get this to fit in there I guess but I'm gonna mix these dry ingredients in my wet here yeah the wet should have been in here but let's get this mixed in there hopefully we can get it to fit yeah okay get this out of here all right slowly mix this and I don't want to make a mess gonna get this all worked in all right we got this mixed up it's a soft dough not too dry semi little bit sticky but not not too bad but you can see the consistency of that okay we're going to add some dried blueberries these are a 3.5 pack I use a couple of them work one and a half packs but they're dried blueberries I like to snack on those those are good in solids too but and it'll bleed in the cookies so that that makes it even better let's see I usually use a packet sometimes use all of them I'm just gonna go for it more the better right and I'm gonna use a pack of white chocolate chips and this is a love an ounce pack and I'll use the whole pack of this up those pour it in there Hansel okay and we're gonna get this mixed up try not to go stir crazy with this you don't want to break up them pretty little blueberries in there so we're just gonna get this all mixed up fold it in gently and I'm gonna chill this dough maybe an hour or so that way that butter has you know time to tighten back up and my cookies won't run as much because a lot of times you know when you make a cookie and oh that thing ran all over the cookie sheet it's been well a lot of times that's why you know let your dough chill for a little bit before you start baking them it does help it makes a big difference on a nice thick chewy cookie so that's all mixed up done and we are gonna chill this for at least an hour in we'll be back all right we are back have my dough nice and chilled it's been chilling for an hour now a lot of people like to use those little scoops I just use my tablespoon but a big tablespoon of it so it's kind of hard because I don't measure when I do this so I just get a big old dollop of it probably maybe even almost a quarter cup size they're back I like them big but maybe just figure maybe two level tablespoons and what I like to do instead of making it a ball these goes nice and firm so it's not gonna spread much I like to put them I like to put them what make them like this and stand them up tall that way they're thick they're nice and thick but we're going to get these all put on here I'm going to get these in a preheated oven at 350 and we're gonna bake these approximate maybe 12 to 17 minutes it depends on the ovens it varies so just keep an eye on them I like to start them on the middle rack and say they don't get real brown on the bottom and between that cooking time I'll transfer them to the top rack that way the bottom doesn't Brown a whole lot because I like even cook even cooking on the bottom and the top of the cookie so I like I kind of switch them out all the time that's just me you know maybe half time bake it on the middle rack and then move them to the top right and don't over bake these guys because these cookies are gonna look underdone and just when you think they're still not done they're actually done because they're gonna firm up once they sit so I'm gonna get these all going here I usually put about maybe six to eight of these cookies on these smaller cookie sheets as you can see I still haven't gotten any more yet but but we'll get these going in we'll be back with the finished product guys alright guys you can see how I have these but I wanted to show you here they are on parchment you don't have to oil it or anything that got plenty of butter in them but you can see here how tall I have them because you want the cookies these are gonna be chewy and these cookies are actually even better the next day because I put them in bags or a container with a lid on it and that moisture from the blueberries just softens these cookies so actually they're better the next day but I wanted you guys to see I I actually put six on each cookie sheet because these are pretty big cookie so give them a lot of room but hopefully you got a bigger cookie sheet than me but you got the idea I'm gonna put these in the middle rack like I said let them cook these are probably gonna take at least 15 to 17 minutes I got thinking cuz these are bigger cookies so smaller cookies probably ten to twelve minutes fourteen or so but I'm gonna start them in the middle rack let them cook maybe eight minutes maybe and then I'll transfer them to my top rack so they'll get even cooking from the bottom ten top so we'll get these going guys and we'll be back okay guys we got them out of the oven they baked actually fifteen minutes exactly like I said I put them in the middle then I moved him to the top you can see how they are when they kind of get poofy on top that's when they're actually done they got a light golden brown to them these things smell so good you guys you gotta make them I'm telling you and tomorrow they're gonna taste even better I'm gonna let them set and I'm gonna put them in some little bags cause like I said these are for my nephew's wife and the baby in him so little gifts they're wonderful people and she requested these so I wanted and and another thing to guys is they're good for Valentine's Day makes them look for that or but we're gonna let these cool and like I said these bake 15 minutes so in a 350 oven I did use probably 2 big tablespoons per cookie so if you know more or less so you'll know what range I'm in there but we're gonna let these cool and we'll be back in a bit all right guys what I like to do is just put these into little cupcake holders just prevent them from sticking together like I said I was getting this little goodie bag here ready for myth Kaitlyn but I don't know Kaitlyn if they're gonna make it that far over there because Curtis already ate one so and he had said these are like way too good mom are you gonna give all these away it's a tell Kaitlyn she ain't getting any but anyway guys there are delicious give them a try please I'm gonna finish bagging these up getting them tied up as a little gift and and remember to like I was saying Valentine's Day is coming up these will make wonderful little gifts to your boss maybe maybe your boxer but they're blueberry white chocolate chip and I'm gonna finish bagging these up and I actually got 24 cookies out of these guys so make them if you like them please like and subscribe please and I'll be back soon with another video and until then bless and enjoy the cookies", "ieqeYrqgQn0": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski from joy baking calm today we are going to make chocolate chip cookies we need to first preheat our oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit that's 190 degrees Celsius and then take two baking sheets and line them with parchment paper or you can just butter them or spray them with a nonstick vegetable spray to begin chocolate chip cookies we will need 1 cup that's 226 grams of unsalted butter now normally I would say to have your butter at room temperature and that is because we chill the batter until firm but if you're like me the only time I make chocolate chip cookies is when my kids come into the kitchen and say mom I want chocolate chip cookies when will they be done so I've had to come up with a way that I don't have to chill the batter and what I have done is I just take the butter cold from the fridge and then I just microwave it for about 10 seconds 10 to 15 seconds just to get the chill off of it so if you can see it's still very firm and that way I can just bake the cookies right away so the kids will only have like 20 minutes to wait from start to finish so what we're going to do is put the butter into the mixer and if you don't have a stand mixer like this just use a electric hand mixer with a large bowl so I'm just going to beat this until it's smooth and creamy a minute or two at medium medium-high speed and you have to scrape down the bowl because it kind of gets caught in the beater especially because it's quite cold just scrape it down as you need to okay that's good so scrape down you can see it's still the butter is still quite cold and that's how we want it here and then I'm going to add to that three quarters of a cup of granulated white sugar that's a hundred and fifty grams and three quarters of a cup of light brown sugar one hundred and sixty grams and then I'm just going to add the same time one and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract try to use a pure because that is much better flavor than any imitation ones so we're only going to beat this until it's incorporated and little fluffy you don't want to get too much air in a cookie batter it's not like a cake where you beat it for a long time to get lots of air in there we're just beating mainly to get all the ingredients mixed together scrape down the sides next we're going to add two large eggs one at a time just beat that in and then add the second egg and now in a separate bowl I placed two and a quarter cups of white all-purpose flour that's 295 grams and then I'm going to add to that one teaspoon of baking soda and a half a teaspoon of salt now we do this in a separate bowl because we want to make sure that that baking soda is really whisked into the flour because we don't want clumps of baking soda in our batter and then it'd be very bitter tasting if you bite into that if there's a clump so I'm just going to add that and then about halfway through mixing that I'm going to add now you can add between like a cup to two cups actually of chocolate chips you can semi-sweet bittersweet depending on how how much chocolate chips you want in your cookies my kids like about a cup in this batter and then if you want you can also add a cup of coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts if you like that but again my kids aren't crazy about nuts so I'm not going to add it here I'm just gonna gradually pour in the chocolate chips down okay so we're done now take my baking sheet now another way that I can have the cookies bake-off night and not spread like problem with chocolate-chip cookies a lot of times is they spread and then the edges burn and the inside is not quite done so what I do is use an ice cream scoop and that kind of compacts the batter so that when they bake they don't have they don't spread as much now this one is about two tablespoons if you don't just use two spoons you can use that as well but I like the ice cream scoop and this about two tablespoons of batter that will hold now if you want large ones you can I've used up to a quarter of a cup sometimes the kids want really big chocolate chip cookies and then you just have to bake them longer if you use a bigger scoop so I'm just going to I don't put too many give them lots of room in case they do spread you can see using one of these handy ice cream scoops makes it really easy and the other thing is all your cookies will be uniform and size so the baking time won't vary all the same shape so kids will just fight over which ones have more chocolate chips than other ones so I just lightly just press down the tops and put these in the oven take about ten maybe twelve minutes depending on your oven and of course depending on some people like their chocolate chip cookies a little underdone so then bake them a little less if you like them quite crisp all the way through bake them a little longer okay just cool the cookies in the pan for a couple of minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling these are really good warm from the oven but they can also be covered and stored at room temperature for several days so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski from jory baking calm", "B8n2vXxqO9s": "hi I'm Diane cometa and today audition with dye I'm making my key lime white chocolate chip cookies these are the perfect summertime cookie but you can make them any time of year so let me show you what you need and we'll get started today under she would die you need some room temperature unsalted butter some granulated sugar some key lime zest or regular lime zest some all-purpose flour some sweetened shredded coconut that has been finely chopped some baking powder and salt an egg and an egg yolk at room temperature some key lime or lime juice at room temperature some white chocolate chips and some pure vanilla extract you're also gonna need some additional ingredients for the glaze but I'll go over that after we're done put in this first part together now the one thing I want to point out is that when you do juice your lime and zest your lime the best thing to do is first wash them off of course but I like to take the limes and put them in the microwave for about 30 to 45 seconds and that heat in there helps to soften them up a little bit and it gets you all the juice out of the line especially if they were refrigerated then after that's warmed then you zest it and then you juice your lime you don't want to try to juice it and then try to take the zest off so it's much easier to zest them first now today I'm using regular limes instead of key limes now I know I said it's a key lime white chocolate chip cookie but I made them as key lime white chocolate chip cookies originally and then when I went to make them again no more key limes at the store and no more key lime juice to be found except on the internet and that was like too long for me to get it to do this recipe but I made them already with the regular lime juice and I have to tell ya there is really no noticeable difference so regular lime juice or key lime juice you can still call them key lime white chocolate chip cookies so let's get started the first thing that we're gonna do is take our dry ingredients which is our all-purpose flour our baking powder and salt and we're going to put this into a bowl along with the coconut and whisk it together now the coconut gives it a little bit of extra texture a little bit of extra sweetness because it's the sweetened coconut and it it just adds something in the background that nobody is really gonna know and I like to cut it up you don't have to cut it up extra fine if you don't want to but I like it really minced like that because then you're not biting into it and getting like a big piece of coconut in there and I just don't like that so you can do what you want with it but this is all you have to do and just throw it in there and then just set this aside now I do have my oven preheating to 325 degrees and I have a rack in the very center and I also have a couple of baking sheets that I've lined with parchment paper you can line them with parchment paper or wax paper or you don't have to line them at all so next thing we're going to do is take the sugar and the zest from the lime and put that in a bowl together and you are gonna rub this together and really rub it you can even go like this with your hands and rub it you're gonna start to really smell that lime it smells absolutely delicious and what this is doing is this is helping to release extra flavor from the zest whereas if you just put this into the dough in the batter just as is it would give you that lime flavor but not as much as this so this is a little trick I do with a lot of recipes that involve using lemon zest lime zest orange zest so it's something that you might want to you know start trying and see how you know you like it recipes but you want to get it and you'll really smell it and the sugar will start to feel damp so it kind of looks like this and it smells fabulous in here and now what we're gonna do is just put in this inside and take our unsalted butter that's been softened in a room temperature and I just want to show you how soft this is that's soft now we're gonna take this and we're going to put this in a nice dice bowl and with a hand mixer or a stand mixer be fixed because it's cool okay that looks good just to get it smooth and now I'm gonna take my sugar and I'm gonna put this in here gradually while the mixer is one so just get that ready and put a little bit in now all of the sugars in there and I'm going to raise this PE to about medium-high and I want to beat this for about two minutes okay so that's what it looks like after about two minutes and now we're going to add the egg and the egg yolk now I have whisk this together lightly so it's combined and I'm just going to gradually pour this in with the mixer on low alright now I'm going to add in my vanilla extract now if you watch the haul video you know that I like the pure vanilla extract this is the Madagascar bourbon and I'm just gonna add a little bit of this in here find that family now it's fine to mix thoroughly and blend everything thoroughly now because we haven't added in the flour yet so I'm just gonna give this a little scrape and then I'm gonna put my flour in I'm noticing this mixture is pretty powerful I usually usually stand mixer for this and my old mixer was like 25 years old that thing that was like on its last leg so I can really see the difference with this so now I'm just gonna gradually put some of this flour in I'm gonna use a spoon and just a little bit at a time I didn't want to mix that too much because now we're gonna add in the lime juice just until it's combined and it's going to be kind of stick all right that looks good I don't want to go any further and what I'm gonna do now is stir in the white chocolate chips put those in and just mix that through that looks perfect and now I'm just gonna take my baking sheet and I have here a small ice cream scoop because if you take a look at this batter you're not going to be able to like pick this up with your hand and roll it or anything like that you are gonna need a scoop or two spoons so I'll show you both ways to do this so what you're gonna do is just grab some of the dough and put that on your baking sheet just like that all right and just leave like you know a couple inches in between or you can use the two spoons and kind of do the same thing so one spoon and then just take it off and just try to make them about the same size and now I'm just going to continue here and then we'll go to the next step all of my cookie dough balls are done I have about thirty six so that's three dozen and I'm gonna take this and put this into my 325 degree oven for approximately 14 minutes now they're not gonna get brown on top they're gonna get a little dry looking but they will get golden underneath so you can check if you'd like to but I've done this several times and it's about 14 minutes after they're done you're gonna take them out of the oven and place them on the counter and leave them on the baking sheet for about two to three minutes then you can take a spatula and remove them from the sheet and put them on a cooling rack to cool completely and then we'll put the glaze on and here they are they cooked for 14 minutes and this is what you're looking for the bottoms are just very lightly golden and you can see the flicks of line and then the tops are just dry so here's what we're going to use for the glaze we have some confection there's sugar here some more lime zest and some lime juice now all I'm gonna do is just put everything into a bowl in the same Bowl and mix it all together now make sure that you don't nest your line too far ahead because what happens is it gets kind of dry so the sooner you use it after you zest it the more intense the flavor is going to be so just put everything in together and then just mix it up okay so there's what you're looking for just make sure that you really mix it together well and I kind of pushed down with my spatula if I see any little lumps of sugar I was lazy I didn't feel like sifting it so if you sift it there won't be any lumps at all but just make sure it's really well combined like that and it looks beautiful with all the little flicks of lime in there so now what we're gonna do is you can do this you know two ways so sometimes I take the cookie and I just take it and I dip it right into the glaze and then I'll put it back on my baking sheet and let it dry or you can just get a little pastry brush like this and brush it on there that seems to put like a little bit more of the lime zest on there this has to dry on there before you can serve them and then they can be put into an airtight container and you can either put them in a bag or like a Tupperware container and you can store them for about a week so I'm gonna take these over to my sister-in-law's house for Memorial Day and we're gonna have a little barbecue and these are just so refreshing and nice and I'm gonna have to taste that first one for you even though the glaze isn't completely solid it's absolutely delicious so here we go mmm lime love that and I got a chocolate chip or white chocolate chip too so I love the little contrast in texture and flavor and little tiny piece of the coconut in there too so it's like the little mystery flavor really great perfect for the summer for all of your holiday parties they travel well and if it's not summertime it'll bring the summertime to you the recipe is on my website dish and with DICOM subscribe to

especially with a glass of ice cold milk but now we have to start with the basics the classic chocolate chip cookie. I'll start by measuring out half a cup of butter that's 4 ounces by weight And I find it's easier to measure by weight then put my butter into a measuring cup I've got exactly four onces there. I judge a good chocolate chip on that balance of crispy outside, chewy inside sweetness to dark chocolate chips and it's all about those nuances. I find, to get just that right amount of sweetness I need half a cup granulated sugar and also half a cup of light brown sugar. It's easy enough to make drop cookies by hand. But an important step is this process called craming. Using your spatula and rubbing against the side of the bowl the butter and the sugar to cream the butter an sugar together. And that lends structure to the cookie so  they'll hold together, they wont crumble apart. And as soon as you see this creamy consistency, then you can add an egg. Because my butter was at room temperature it's a good idea to have your egg at room temperature. At the same time, I'll add a teaspoon of vanilla and just blend this together. Okay Now, for the dry ingredints I'll ad a cup and a quarter of all purpuse flour. And now, I'll share with you my signature ingredient to add to chocolate chip cookies a tablespoon of corn starch. I am a big fan of cookies that are crispy on the outside but chewy on the center. This addition wil ensure they will stay soft in the center. Now, I'll add half a teasppon of baking soda Half a teaspoon of salt And I'll just sift this through and then just combine until blended. You don't commonly associate the work of a pastry chef with something simple, like a drop cookie. But honestly, in my profession, I've made thousands of drop cookies. So you really get a lot of practice in there. There we go, I've got the flour blended into the dough And of course, where would a chocolate chip cookie be without the chocolate chips? I am using chocolate chips, that are made for chocolate chip cookies. And they hold their shape they also set up nicely after they've cooled. I find that a cup and a half is the perfect amount. You need to have a bit of chocolate in every bite That being said, if you're big fan, a little bit extra is just fine. I also like to add a cup of chopped, toasted pecans. So of course the idea here is to make sure that the chips and pecans are really worked into the cookie dough batter. You can really tell by this dough that every bite is going to get more than one chocolate chip. Okay, now it's time for scooping and dropping the cookies The simplest technique is to just use a measurement of about two tablespoons quickly roll it in your hands into a ball shape. A question I get asked often about chocolate chip cookies is why you can make the same particular recipe but they bake out differently. Sometimes they spread, and sometimes they hold their shape. It's the room temperature butter you start with that impacts the way that bakes. To fix that, simply preshape your cookies like I am now and then pop the dough in the fridge for an hour When it sets the dough no matter how you started with your cookie recipe they will always bake out beautifully. Now I fit 24 cookies on this one tray Not that I'm going to bake 24 on one tray but it takes up less space in the fridge when I chill them. I'll just pop these in the fridge to chill for an hour and I have a tray that's already spent an hour in the fridge. As you can see, these are quite firmly set now so I know, they'll bake off evenly. A great tip to get ahead on your cookie baking is to actually make your batches chill them like this then you can actually pack them up together in resealable bags and freeze them. You need emergency cookies after a really bad day at school? Pull out two or three let them thaw for twenty minutes on the counter before baking and you've got freshly baked cookies on the spot. So now, of course  I have to make room for the cookies to bake So I'll put twelve on each tray It's a good idea to leave about 2 inches space between each of the cookies in all directions. Here we go, evenly spaced. I've preheted my oven to 355 and the cookies take between 15 and 18 minutes to turn a nice golden brown just around the edges. I let my chocolate chip cookies cool on their tray before removing them so they set up a little bit I have a tray that's just cool That is the hardest part about making chocolate chip cookies waiting for them to cool just a little bit. But you can see! Chocolate, this is still soft and melting. And the cookies are chewy all the way through Every bite is gonna have some chocolate chip and a little bit of that buttery pecan.", "uRtmEylgBEQ": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "Syq6eyHQRbk": "(laid-back music) - Thank you so much for watching.

We pretty much bought all the chocolate chips in New York City. We baked, we tested, we ate, and now we have the ultimate chocolate chip recipe for you. We're gonna ball out with a few extra flavors, but really all you need for cookies are sugar, flour, fat, eggs, and chocolate, and on our quest to find the best, we had to test out what all of these ingredients do to a cookie, and how we can use their best properties to come up with the ultimate recipe. Let's talk sugar. So we've got white sugar, light brown sugar, and dark brown sugar. Really the only difference is the addition of molasses. Light brown sugar has a bit of molasses, and dark brown has a bit more molasses in it. For this test, we wanted to see what just using one sugar in each dough would do to a cookie. With all white sugar, spread the most, didn't have a ton of flavor. Light brown sugar was a little bit chewier, spread a little bit less. Then the dark brown sugar was really overpowering in its flavor, and spread the least, and visually you can see a big difference too. And what we found was, you really can't get that classic flavor just using one. Next thing we had to tackle is flour. So we've got all purpose, bread flour, and cake flour. Really the only difference here is the amount of protein and therefore gluten in these flours. Just think about it like this. Bread's like really nice and chewy, has a great texture, great structure having that gluten and protein, whereas cake you think of it as tender, it's light, it's airy, it's gonna have less of those things. What it really comes down to is taste and texture. All purpose gave you, you know, standard cookie. The bread flour led to a significantly chewier cookie. The cake flour was the one that really spread the most, it was pretty delicate. And then similar to sugar, we decided that in order to get the best result, you gotta use a combination of two. So on to fat. We wanted to see the difference between softened butter and melted butter, and then we wanted to see what would happen if we switched it out completely and used coconut oil. Between softened butter and melted butter, visually they look pretty similar. The melted butter spread a little bit more, and then taste we didn't notice a huge difference either. Tested with coconut oil and it worked, it was a cookie, but it lost that great oomph you know, that butter brings to all baked goods. So in the end, we definitely prefer using butter. Eggs, we went pretty simple with this one. Just an egg and and egg yolk contributes to more of like a fudgier, richer cookie. Obvously we're making chocolate chip cookies, we have to have chocolate chips, but we're also gonna add a little bit something extra with some chunks of dark chocolate. Cut it with a serrated knife into little chunks, and add that to your dough. It's really nice, 'cause you have a variance of flavors and textures throughout. It's really just a few fundamental ingredients and learning how to master their properties, in order to get the best result that you're after. And finally, after all that testing, we came up with our ultimate recipe. Here we go. So we're gonna start by sifting out the flour. We're gonna do all purpose and bread flour. Salt and baking soda as well. We really liked the chew factor of the bread flour with a combination of all purpose, to kind of give us best of both worlds. And then we're gonna move on to the butter. So we're gonna do melted butter, but we're gonna take it one step further and brown it. All you need to do to make brown butter is throw it all in a sauce pan, and get it to a boil. After a few minutes of boiling, the milk solids in the butter are gonna start to toast, and turn a really gorgeous brown, nutty color. Keep stirring it to make sure that the butter is browning evenly, and once you can see the really dark brown bits on the bottom, you're gonna pour it off, ideally into a liquid measuring cup. This is gonna do two things. One, it's going to quickly cool down the butter so it stops the cooking. You don't want to burn it. And then also we wanna make sure that we have a cup of liquid when it's all said and done. So while making the brown butter, you do end up boiling off a good amount of liquid, so we're just gonna top it up with a bit of water until we reach one cup. Just let it chill out a bit, let it come to room temperature before you proceed. So we found that we really need a combination of white and dark brown sugar to get that really great flavor that we were after. So add the vanilla at this point, and the espresso powder. Espresso powder is one of those little flavor boosters. Again all about those contrasting notes that really work well with anything really sweet. And then you're gonna add in that liquid gold, oh my gosh, so nice, and cream those together. That's another reason we want the butter to be a little bit on the cooler side. It incorporates really, really nicely with the sugar. When we were testing, if you add the brown butter when it's too hot, it can make the dough a little bit greasy. Then, in go the egg and the egg yolk. And the smell that comes off this thing, oh my God, it's pretty much like the best smell you can get from cooking. And then go the flour. We like to do it in about thirds or so, just so you don't have flour going all over your kitchen, and just beat it until you don't see a ton of extra flour. It doesn't need to be totally incorporated, a little bit of flour that's not incorporated is actually good. You'll finish incoporating the rest of the flour when you fold in the chocolate. The nice thing about using these chunks is that you get some small shards of chocolate that kind of get everywhere, mixed with the chopped up chocolate chunks, and it's kind of like, oh, so good. And that's it, that's your dough. Try to not to eat it all when its raw. Alright, so if you're an A+ student, you can go ahead and put these in the fridge to chill overnight, and you'll get the best flavor that way. But if you have no self restraint like me, you can bake them off right now. The nice thing about this dough is it has so much flavor that we've built into it, that they're still gonna be really, really good if you bake them right away. If you are gonna be amazing and put them in the fridge overnight, we do recommend scooping them first and putting them on a baking sheet, then putting them in the fridge. It's just so much easier than trying to scoop a really hard dough from the fridge. Cookies are kind of the equalizer of all baked goods. There's so much fancy stuff out there, but honestly is there anything better than a perfect chocolate chip cookie? Just look at that. You've got these pockets of chocolate from using those big chocolate chunks. It's got all the cracks and crinkles that you want in a chocolate chip cookie. The center's ooey gooey. The outside is crunchy. It's just got kind of like all the flavor and texture that you could possibly pack into one little cookie, and you'll never go back to another recipe again. Here's a list of top five smells in the culinary world, and I'm pretty sure butter comes up number one all the time. This is just a list I made up, but. (laughs) - [Male] I was gonna say, what. - [Narrator] It's a top culinary list. Ask anyone, oh my God, brown butter, oh, so good.", "V3k0WTfzisw": "hi I'm Diane cometa and today audition with dye I'm making cranberry orange white chocolate chip cookies these are one of my all-time favorite cookies and I can't wait to make them so let's get started today I'm dishing with dye you need an orange some granulated sugar light brown sugar white chocolate chips dried cranberries an egg that's been lightly whisked and some vanilla extract I also have some flour salt and baking soda in a bowl that I've combined thoroughly and I have some softened unsalted butter so I'm just gonna set that aside and the first thing that I'm gonna do is take my orange and I'm gonna zest this into a bowl so just use a microplane and just grate that off and I just want to get a tablespoon or so now don't worry if you have some left over don't throw it out put it in a little baggie and put it in your freezer and the same goes if you just want to eat an orange or a lemon if you have a lemon that you're gonna use for something else zest that off and then take the zest and put it into a baggie and then when you need orange zest or lemon zest for another recipe or lime zest then you have it available to you so we're gonna use all of this today okay now I'm going to set this aside next take your orange and you're just gonna cut this in half take the bowl of dried cranberries and you're gonna do sit into the cranberries this is a special trick put this into your microwave for about 30 seconds on high and what that's gonna do is obviously heat it up but it'll help to soften the cranberries and then they're going to become infused with a little bit of that orange flavor from the orange juice and now I'm going to set this as for about ten minutes and then I'll show you what we're gonna do with them next so I have my oven preheating to 350 degrees and I have two baking sheets that are lined with parchment paper the first thing you're gonna do is take a mixer hand or stand and take the unsalted soft butter and you're gonna put that in now I'm just gonna beat this for just a minute until it gets kind of creamy okay that's good now I have my shirts here I like to combine them I mean you could just put them in there if you want so I'm just gonna combine this real quick here just mix it together and then we're gonna put this in with the butter so these cookies I I get these well I started getting these at a bakery a long time ago and I was like I gotta figure out how to make these things because they're so delicious it's just such a fresh taste the orange and the cranberry together and then with the white chocolates in there the white chocolate chips sorry it's just so good okay so that looks good so now with the mixer on low I'm gonna gradually pour this in and then once you get it in there and all the sugar kind of gets coated with the butter then turn it up and you're just gonna cream this it's not gonna get like super creamy but it's gonna get lighter in color and a little bit fluffy okay now I'm just gonna give this a little scrape and give it a couple more twirls okay that's good now I have my egg my vanilla extract and my orange zest so again I like to put everything together so I just put my vanilla in there and I'm gonna throw my orange zest in there to give that a little swish around I always like to lightly beat the eggs too because I don't know I don't see any reason why you shouldn't so I let it go in there all like that so no one to overmix though give it a head start so just gradually gonna pour this in okay and then once it starts to get combined just move it up okay so now what I'm gonna do is take the cranberries and they're in the juice so I have to kind of strain this off now normally I just go over to the sink and do this but I'm just gonna show you just you have to get rid of this okay you don't want all this moisture in your dough so do that put that aside and then in the paper towel you just want to take your cranberries and then just kind of press them out and just set that aside okay so now I'm gonna take my flour with the mixer on low and I'm gonna add a little bit more than a third of this to my batter here put that in there just don't want to put it all in at once we're kind of one of let it get coated and then put a little bit more in just put the rest in just gradually a little bit once it gets coated put the rest I'm just gonna give this a little scrape kind of help it out okay that's good now I'm gonna take my cranberries I'm just gonna press them a little bit and I'm gonna put those in and my chips and then the chips go in now I'm just gonna stir this with my mixer do it by hand I'm gonna take my baking sheet that's lined with the parchment paper and take my cookie dough and I have a small ice cream scooper you could also use just a tablespoon or two spoons to do this and you want to get about a tablespoon and a half to two tablespoons on there and then you're just gonna go around and put it on your sheet about two inches apart now I'm gonna take these and I'm gonna put these into my preheated oven for approximately twelve minutes or until the top is like just lightly browned and I'll show you what that looks like when they're done after they're done just leave them on the baking sheet for about five minutes before you move them over to the cooling rack and here they are they're all done now these are still cooling but fortunately I made some yesterday because I'm doing all my holiday baking so have some right here that I can show you and I just want to break one open for you so you can see what it looks like inside they're very light and crisp and the bottoms the bottoms are just lightly browned burst of orange especially if you bite into a cranberry because we saturated those in the orange juice and I love that and then of course you know the white chocolate and the cookie is crisp it's nice and it's lightly browned on the bottom I mean these are so easy and they're really impressive on a holiday tray or if you just want to impress yourself the recipe is on my website edition with DICOM they're perfect for the holidays

delicious bye bye now", "WAHQL7LwT-M": "today I bring you a classic cookie recipe with a modern day twist perfect for the upcoming Christmas season although you can have it any time of year this color just looks absolutely extraordinary and I guarantee you as soon as you see it you're gonna want one have a look at these beautiful red velvet chocolate chip cookies on the one pot chef let's get started making our cookies now I'm using my big stand mixer today you don't need to use one of these if you don't have one don't worry about you can just use a regular hand mixer we'll be fine but I just find what I'm doing a big batch of cookies the big mixer is always good to use so first things first I'm putting in 125 grams of butter that's nice soft room-temperature butter 125 grams is about a stick in America measurements and to that I'm gonna add in half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar and all we need to do is start mixing our butter and sugar together until they're nicely creamed together next I'm gonna add in one egg half a teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/4 of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and two tablespoons of red food coloring now that sounds like a lot but the red food coloring you need a good dose of it in order to get that red velvet color now all we need to do is start beating this together don't be afraid to scrape down the sides occasionally just to make sure everything's getting mixed together properly and with the mixer going what we're gonna do is start adding in our flour I've got 1 and 3/4 cups of self-raising flour which I'm just gonna slowly and gradually add in while it's beating [Music] as you can see we've got that lovely deep red velvet colored mixture there and all that's left to do is to add our chocolate chips I'm putting in 250 grams or about a cup and a half of white chocolate chips you don't have to use white chocolate you could use milk or dark if you prefer but I think the white really sort of stands out and all you need to do is just carefully fold them into the dough and all this left to do is to take spoonfuls of the mixture and we're just going to carefully roll them into balls using your hands make sure they're nice and clean until you get a nice little ball and continue with the rest once rolled arrange some of the balls onto an oven tray lined with some non-stick baking paper and I've left a little gap between each of the balls that way when they spread out they won't end up connecting together but these are ready to go into the oven preheated oven 200 degrees Celsius 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 to 12 minutes or until the cookies have spread and are looking absolutely gorgeous while our cookies are in the oven I thought I'd take an opportunity to remind you to check out my social media Facebook Twitter and Instagram links in the video description underneath this video on YouTube and speaking of YouTube don't forget to subscribe to my channel click the subscribe button and that little notification bell next to it that way you won't miss out on any of my new videos this is our first batch of cookies fresh out of the oven they look absolutely gorgeous look at that beautiful crinkling effect on top they spread out yeah but they're still quite soft just touch it there I strongly recommend you leave them on the tray for at least 5 to 10 minutes allow them to firm up slightly before transferring them onto a wire rack to cool completely I also recommend only doing one tray at a time I find they cook much more consistently if you do one trailer time rather than trying to do two at a time and here we have our completed red velvet chocolate chip cookies are ready to eat and they look absolutely stunning that beautiful color the rich red and the white dots all through it absolutely stunning I managed to make about 30 cookies out of this mixture using about a tablespoon of mixture per cookie but it really comes down to the size you can make them smaller or larger depending on your own personal tastes I cannot wait to dive in and have a taste of these how stunning of they look at that color absolutely gorgeous time for me to dive in and have a taste just like a proper chocolate-chip cookie should be it's crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside that beautiful shocking dark red with a little white flecks all through it honestly perfect for Christmas although red velvet isn't just for Christmas it's for life well I hope you enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one-pot chef show calm and until next time see you later these are absolutely beautiful the whole kitchen smells absolutely amazing and seriously I need a glass of milk or maybe a glass of eggnog to wash some of these am honestly they're just so beautiful you're gonna want to make these trust me everyone's gonna love them", "8-1Ey-8YOUg": "Hi everyone! today I'm here with two very special guests, my niece and nephew, Natalie and Evan today

okay start your mixer and blend this butter really really well to add your sugar that's your relative but before you add your brown and white sugar you're going to make sure your butter is blend it

recording yes awesome alright guys haha I didn't even introduce myself hey guys welcome to my channel I am Lydia and today we are making let me make sure I got this vanilla white chocolate chip pudding cookies I'm looking at my notes oh listen guys I need my notes just to make sure I'm not stumbling all over my words because I do that quite often I talk kind of fast I kind of make a lot of hand movements and I'm kind of all over the place just because I'm so excited to be sharing putting cookies with you because pretty cookies are so good if you guys have not had pudding cookies it is a must they are so soft and they actually don't taste like pudding they have like no pudding consistency at all but they are soft they melts in your mouth they're decadent they're delicious if you like cookies like I do make sure you're subscribed to my channel leave me a comment give me a huge like I'd really appreciate it and let me show you how to make these delicious cookies that's are called vanilla white chocolate chip putting cookies alright let's get to it to start off this recipe pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit line two baking sheets with parchment paper and then in a large bowl add in your brown sugar and your granulated sugar with your butter that's been softened and go ahead and start creaming everything together until it is lovely and combined so it should look something like this I'm using a hand mixer for now but I'll get into that later once that is nice and creamed add in your vanilla package so this is instant vanilla pudding it's not a really big package I'm just adding that into my bowl and then go ahead and crack your eggs I'm actually cracking my eggs in the bowl I had my sugar just because I don't want any egg shell in my final product that would not be good that would be pretty nasty so I added my eggs once you add your eggs add in your vanilla bean paste I'm using vanilla bean paste for this recipe I think it's really delicious it plays off the vanilla putting flavor and if you're using vanilla bean paste make sure you scrape every last drop because if you have bought this stuff you know it is pretty pricey so get every last drop of vanilla bean paste that you can possibly get out then go ahead and cream this all up together so it is nice and combined you'll also probably want to scrape your sides like I have just because you want everything to be incorporated you don't want any dry bits of vanilla just hanging out so I'm gonna go ahead and scrape my sides and then once I scraped the sides I went ahead and beat this again now make sure you're using a really big ball bigger than this if you're going to use a hand mixer in a small bowl add in your flour your baking soda and your salt all you're going to do is just quickly whisk everything so it is combined when you're baking always add your dry ingredients in a separate bowl and combine them before you add them to your wet ingredients so once everything is combined you can go ahead and add your flour to your bowl like I said if you're using a hand mixer use a very large bowl and to avoid any unnecessary mess or kitchen mishaps add your flour to your wet ingredients and use a rubber spatula to combined most of the flour into the wet ingredients just because if you go right away with your hand mixer Oh make a mess and totally trying to avoid this so once most of your flour is incorporated into the butter mixture turn on your hand mixer on low speed once you have everything combined and go ahead and start mixing up everything now I wish I would have used the standing mixer honestly I would recommend a standing mixer for making this recipe just because it's easier so once you are combining it you'll see that it is like kind of crumbly and everything it's okay you're totally fine everything is going to work out this is just because the hand mixer isn't as powerful as a standing mixer and then once everything is nicely combined kind of like this try to avoid the next thing I'm about to do [Applause] not I did not yep and I did that I was trying to avoid that this entire time so that's why I really would recommend you using a standing mixer for the whole process so I went ahead and use the spatula to kind of incorporate everything I'm adding my chocolate chips reserved 1/4 cup of the white chocolate chips do not put that in with the other ones you want to reserve it because we're going to add this to the top just to make it extra pretty so I added my white chocolate chips and I started mixing up everything with a rubber spatula actually cleaned up my kitchen oh my goodness you guys that batter got everywhere I wasn't too happy about it but it was all worth it because these cookies were really good so mix up everything make sure every piece of batter has a piece of chocolate chip pallies you don't want any cookies without any chocolate chips using a cookie scoop that is about a tablespoon and a half you want to start scooping up your cookies and placing them on your cooking sheets that you've prepared with parchment paper make sure your oven is preheated now you are going to get a lot of cookies I got around 40 cookies I would say and that is a lot so if you are not planning to use all these cookies what you can do is you can actually scoop up all the cookies that you're planning not to use and put them on a baking sheet and then freeze them in the freezer until they are completely frozen and then on the outside of the ziplock bag write the temperature that the oven needs to be at to bake these cookies and the amount of time that is needed to bake the cookies and once you are ready to bake them just make sure your cookies are completely thought out and you can bake them and have fresh cookies on hand which is always awesome so that is a quick tip if you don't want to use all of this cookie dough batter which is pretty good and resist the urge to snack on any of this because there is a raw cookies and you don't want that so I went ahead and flattened my first batch you don't actually have to do this I'll show you what the next batch looks like because the next batch I actually didn't flatten the tops so if you're in a hurry and you don't feel like lining the top not to worry you do not have to do this step once I was done I went ahead and baked these bake your cookies for around 12 to 14 minutes or until they're slightly golden brown on the top you don't want to go over that you still want chewiness so once they come out of the oven as you can see they're still pretty like black boring so what I did with the remainder of the white chocolate chips I went ahead and pressed them onto my cookies now do this right away when your cookies are still hot like straight away when they come out of the oven do it be careful not to burn yourself you should be fine you shouldn't really bring yourself and I just pressed around two to three of these chocolate chips onto my cookies they should stick no problem I also thought I should mention that I'm not viciously pressing the white chocolate chips into the cookies I'm just gently pressing them into the cookies but that one didn't want to stick so you might have to use a little bit of you know manpower to get it to stick I feel like homemade cookies are one of the most underrated dessert ever of all times I think that people should give cookies more recognition because they are so good especially when they're homemade not store-bought cookies those don't even compare so this is what my flat cookies look like they look pretty basic and pretty delicious if you ask me I really like the way the white chocolate chips stand on top of them and next I'm going to show you this is the rounded ones that I did not press down with a spoon so they're just slightly domed on top not much of a difference from the flat ones so if you don't want to flatten them this is kind of what they'll look like I'm just pressing the white chocolate chips onto these cookies also I do like these ones because they're a little bit more rounded but it doesn't really matter I think they look really good either way once you are finished pressing the white chocolate chips onto the cookies make sure you transfer your cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely then you can devour your cookies I think homemade cookies are just overlooked they're so simple and good and a good basic recipe is always a need and am I the only one that has little patience and wants to eat their cookies before they're completely cooled off I know I like mine when they're slightly warm so you don't have to worry about letting them cool off completely Here I am breaking one and they're so soft and chewy on the inside perfectly browned on the bottom and then you could take it a step further like I I went ahead and started dipping my cookie in milk because cookies and milk are kind of like the best things ever like I said just a simple dessert that is perfect if you ever recreate my recipes make sure you tag me on Instagram I would love to see your recreations and just enjoy this simple delicious dessert that is awesome [Music] [Laughter] grossly devoured that thing just embarrassing that that cookie is almost demolished it was good this is embarrassing though if you guys want a soft cookie a decadent delicious airy cookie listen you have to try these pudding cookies I'm gonna have to look at my notes again my vanilla white chocolate chip pudding cookies I think I said it right because there's just too many like things going on with this cookie but definitely give it a try if you guys like macadamia nuts add those to these cookies I think that would be so good I didn't do that because I didn't think about it and tell I was making them and if you guys think there's too many chocolate chips take some okay or add more you can also switch it up do what you like make this recipe your own because that is what is that didn't make sense because that's what baking is all about so just make everything your own make sure you guys are subscribed to my channel thanks for watching and check out my other videos and I'll see you guys next time see ya babe did you like the cookies wait I gotta end okay bye see ya", "h212Bbh1ny8": "today i have a special valentine's day cookie for\u00a0\nyou guys actually these are

guys welcome back merry christmas and happy holidays today i'll be showing you my wife's super delicious chocolate chip cookie recipe or as we like to call them in our household crack cookies because you can't stop eating them they're super addictive can't wait to show you but before we do that please take a quick second to subscribe to the channel make sure to hit that bell enable notifications as well alright let's make it happen we're going to start by spooning in some all-purpose flour into our cup measurer we're going to use exactly two and three-fourths cup all-purpose flour this technique is critical because as you guys know baking is definitely a science so you want to be as accurate as possible in your measurements and spooning the flour into the measuring cup here and then knocking off the excess with the back end of a butter knife is about as accurate as it gets so we're going to repeat that process for exactly 2 and 3 4 cup of flour as always guys specific measurements and ingredients provided for you in the description box below make sure to check that out next we're going into our next mixing bowl with one cup of melted butter followed by 1 and 1 4 cup of brown sugar and a half cup of white sugar we're using a higher brown sugar ratio for this recipe because brown sugar is made from molasses which is a bit higher in moisture and just gives cookies a nice soft and chewy texture and everybody likes soft and chewy cookies so that's why we're going with that break out your whisk and mix everything to combine going in with one egg and one egg yolk you want to whisk that in as well you want your eggs to be room temperature also next we're going in with one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract and then we're going to add two teaspoons of corn starch and one teaspoon of baking powder to our flour mixture along with a pinch of salt and whisk those ingredients together as you can see we have our dry ingredients and our wet ingredients separated next we're going to add those together to make our cookie dough looking good so right here guys you want to go ahead and begin folding in your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients add a little bit at a time break out that rubber spatula and just fold all those ingredients together looking good this recipe is so good guys i can't wait for you guys to try it make sure you leave me a comment let me know if you plan on making this for christmas or you know for new year something like that hell i'd make this any day of the week but be careful because like i said they are super addictive so here we are just continuing to mix in our dry and wet ingredients you want to keep doing this until it resembles cookie dough and all the flour is absorbed or until you get carpal tunnel whichever comes first just a reminder guys all the specific measurements and ingredients can be found in the description box below keep in mind that baking is definitely a science and you want to make sure you follow the recipe as closely as you possibly can now we look like we have some cookie dough developing just in time for us to add one half cup of chocolate chips one half cup of white chocolate chips and three fourths cup of toffee chips the toffee is totally optional if you're not a fan of white chocolate you don't have to add that either really at this point you have your cookie dough base you can add whatever kind of chips you want this is just the recipe that my wife uses and it is phenomenal guys so i can't wait to share it with you let me know in the comments what your favorite cookie is though i'm i'm super interested in hearing that all right so just fold those chips in and we're going to pop that in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes you do want your cookie dough to be chilled because it does prevent spreading so if you don't uh chill your cookie dough first before you pop it in the oven uh you'll get those super flat uh you know really flat wide cookies and you know it's just not as appealing to the eye still will taste good but we're looking for presentation as well so now we want to line a baking sheet with some parchment paper preheat your oven to 350 degrees and you want to roll out your cookie dough into equal size balls like so and just repeat that process until you've used all of your cookie dough or until you filled your baking sheet and if you're like me and you have some leftover cookie dough then grab one of these mini skillets and just press the cookie dough into it to kind of you know fill it don't overfill it because it will rise a little bit in the oven looking good giving you guys both versions you got the you know the chocolate chip cookies coming out of the oven and then the mini skillets like they serve at the restaurants you will definitely impress your house guests you can get these mini cast iron skillets on amazon relatively cheap this is how we're looking when they come out of the oven brace yourself for a trademark money shot man those look good little blue bell vanilla ice cream and a mint garnish and you know i've got to try this we gotta pour in a little milk oh man these are dangerous man i'm telling you looking good i got to dip mine a little milk just for the taste test moment of truth those should be illegal let me know what you think in the comments make sure to give me a thumbs up please subscribe to the channel and share this channel on your social media if you do make any of my recipes please remember to tag me i love seeing what you guys make hope everybody has a safe and happy holidays and as always thanks for your support", "o9C1TR5I8YA": "hi everyone and welcome back to the cupcake Gemma tunnel now you are about to watch a recipe video for the New York cookies the red velvet version which is something you have been asking us for ages about now this is just a little disclosure video to say that Gemma Dane and I shot this a few weeks back before the whole outbreak of coronavirus so obviously our shop is now shut so please don't come on down because there'll be no one there and no cakes the cookies for you stay home and stay safe but in the meantime we have been busy here at crumbs and doilies making all our cookie kits and cake kits and you guys are loving them and we really want to share this video with you because obviously we can't share these cookies in store so we have added them to the cupcake Gemma website so head over there once you've watched this video and you'll find everything you need besides a little bit of butter and some eggs but you've got the recipe we've got some white chocolate some sugar mixes there's flowers Coco's we've even got some vanilla and some red food coloring so you don't need to worry about anything so head over there enjoy the video and enjoy the cookies [Music] hi guys welcome to crumbs noise in Soho where we're becoming fast known for our fabulous cookies yeah we all have been to New York really recently and we discovered these cookies and we just all became totally obsessed with them yeah so we came back and we spent a couple days rescue testing of loads of different recipes and to bake these style of cookies and we came up with our first one which is milk chocolate morning to you and then after that Gemma quickly demanded a double chocolate version because you have to have a double chocolate version or your cookie I wanted something a little bit more pizzazz which is amazing yeah it's got that amazing hair and eyes like chocolate in it as well and you can find links to all of these videos in the description box below yeah and on our last video we asked you guys which you would like to see next and the most requested was red velvet which is great because I love red velvet so that means I'm about to eat one first of all these guys need to make them and they're gonna show you how to do it so off you go come on upstairs okay we are back in Soho with the red velvet cookie and it all starts with the butter yeah so we've got 230 grams of cold I suspect it's going straight into the bowl so now it's going straight onto the mixer without travel attachment and we're gonna beat that for just a couple of seconds just to break the butter cool so it's just broken the butter up and if you've seen some of the other videos of the cookies that we've done and we go a little bit more in depth about kind of the mixing methods and basically as a rule you just don't want to over mix this we are just combining the ingredients yeah and so next we're going to add our two sugars we've got soft light brown sugar and we've got caster sugar both 160 grams going straight into the mixer and then we're just gonna pop this on to a medium speed just until we start seeing the guts form with the sugar and the butter okay so now it's time for the chocolate and we've gone for white chocolate chips we tried it with dark chocolate and milk chocolate cuz obviously red velvet doesn't have chocolate in it but it does like a red velvet cake has the kind of cream cheese icing yeah so we thought this kind of replicates and it adds the kind of sweetness as well yeah a really nice contrast between the red dough and the white chocolate chips yeah we've got 450 grams of the chips yeah going straight in alright so the white chocolate is just mixed through and now we can get on with the dry ingredients so we've got 470 grams of plain flour here and we're gonna mix our cocoa into it so if you don't know what red velvet is you probably do but it is and essentially it's a vanilla cake with a hint of cocoa so we're gonna put some cocoa into our flour and we've got a mixture you can do this just with normal cocoa powder and in total we've got 25 grams so if you don't have this exciting black cocoa just go for 25 grams of cocoa powder but we have recently discovered the black okay yeah and it's amazing and it's super intense you can buy it online just search for black cocoa so here we've got 15 grams of regular and 10 grams of black and we're gonna pop both of those in the flour just give it a little mix around so that we don't have to mix too much when we get it in the dough [Music] and to the flour and cocoa mixture we're going to add one teaspoon of salt and then three teaspoons of baking powder which they're raising agent and the salt will just give it a really nice flavor yes so it is important to you so we wouldn't like using it but it really does kind of pull out all your flavors so you know I get it so it's not the best thing but in cookies are definitely so those are all mixed in so we can add them to the batter so we'll just switch this on a low speed just until it starts to get to a nice sandy consistency that's got some a nice breadcrumb consistency and now we can prepare other ingredients which we're going to add into the mixture yes I'm at the moment it's just kind of dry and it doesn't look like dough at all and so we're going to bind it together with our eggs and we've got two large free-range eggs and we're gonna do one extra egg yolk and adding that extra egg yolk we'll just find the dough a little bit more together and you'll see in our chocolate recipe that we added that extra egg yolk just because the cocoa powder is a little bit drier yeah until that we're gonna add a full teaspoon of vanilla extract because that's really important in the red velvet flavor and then obviously we need some red yeah I've just got a regular teaspoon here and I've got some red food coloring and I'm using a pastry blowing just cause there's a lot more concentrated and liquid and it would change the consistency of the dough if you use a liquid soap paste is best you can get this in supermarkets as well as cake decorating shops and online as well so once that's all mixed in granted it doesn't look like the most delicious thing but it is once it's done the cookies we prepare easiest way to make send about food coloring so straighten with the egg and on a low speed [Music] so that's all come together as a dough and it's kind of pulled away from the sides of the ball that's how you know it's ready so now we just need to roll them out into balls as usual so we've got our scales because we're going to make sure that all nice and even and do the professional way and we're gonna go for a hundred and twenty-five ground balls and we are wearing our certificates again have black gloves which some of you used and made and sharing your stories so good find and you know especially as this has got the red food coloring in you probably do want to wear a pair of gloves because otherwise your hands are just gonna get turned red yes okay okay so and I might be a bit of a button that doesn't mix so you can just scrape underneath kind of leave it together let's see if you can do this 125 gram thing okay and as usual what we don't want to do is really squish this together we're just lightly picking it up kind of forming a rough ball and popping it in a tin this way they're going to be nice and chunky and they're going to fall apart and if you kind of roll them too much they're gonna have like a weird forward like smooth domed effect which you don't really want kind of like the riff nice ripples oh yeah yeah [Music] okay so as you know we're making 13 cookies which is a baker's dozen and one did recently tell me that I forgot it already did you guys eat one oh yeah brilliant and as you know if you've seen the others you know that these need to freeze for 90 minutes preferably overnight the best thing is that you can keep them in the fridge and just think one of the reasons are in bake one at a time as and when you wish had in the freezer so you ready to bake yes and again as usual we've got our baking tray nice and hot in the oven to make sure we get that nice crispy bottom and we're just gonna spread them out across the tray they are gonna spread a little bit so don't put them right next to each other you can fit about what there's a very good Avenue we've got massive ovens here how's that yeah that's good and they're gonna bake at 180 degrees see that's with a fan and we're gonna bake them for 14 minutes until they're nice and kind of crispy on top [Music] [Music] Oh guys you've done it again haven't you we have they do I don't know let's have a look inside yes shall I be much looks like your bed your name yeah ready said we cooled them down for about 15 minutes mmm-hmm and that is perfect just did a bit warm and they give me nice and squishy easy texture lovely slightly salty not your outlet no good hit vanilla yeah and the white chocolate work takes it brings a kind of sweetness good Donna I think it would be a shame not to have anyone yeah yeah and it's great with the black cocoa tree because it makes a nice kind of Burgundy hello oh yeah better than like a lurid right yeah yeah exactly those Beauty yeah and you know if you can get the black cocoa it really does add like a kind of intense kind of bitterness which one really works yes Yama's delicious fantastic do this one thank you the books yeah so that's for now and always ready for more as well so keep giving it to your suggestions and cuz I mean we're already playing with loads anyway so I'm sure we'll come back with some more soon and yeah yes my favorite is I think it's a birthday cake this is a close second yeah definitely mmm-hmm well I suppose we better get these downstairs to some hungry customers but don't forget to tag us on Instagram and because we love seeing your pictures so many of you are making them which is so exciting so my goodness this is the most made recipe yeah all time yeah lady we just ate and they're all coming out amazingly - like you don't you guys are doing like such a great job yeah and so yeah tag us on Instagram use hashtag cupcake Gemma and we'll put all of our Instagram and accounts down in the description box below as well okay we would take these downstairs see them tidy up the bits one of us so all of us will be back next week with another recipe yeah yeah see you then right come on cookies [Laughter] [Music] [Music] you", "l588RRtK5ig": "[Music] hello foodies welcome back to sherry the chef today we're gonna be making one of my favorites one of my husband's favorites - white chocolate macadamia nut cookies so I don't quite remember the first time I had one these cookies I'm thinking it might have been subway years ago I know they still sell them and every time I go in there I have to get one I don't know where it was I just know I was that's why I don't remember I think I was just like in complete heaven so that's what we're gonna be making today and feel free to double this recipe it's a smaller recipe but like I said you can feel free to double it so I've got it stick of butter in here and I'm just gonna add 2/3 of a cup of sugar and we're gonna slide our mixer attachment on lock it in place we're going to cream our butter and sugar together and once that's nice and fluffy I'm gonna add in an egg and most people probably put one teaspoon of vanilla man I'm gonna put two teaspoons in I really like the Mexican vanilla or the Madagascar which paper shuffling again now I'm excited about that I can't cream this together take just a second to scrape down my sides and then we're gonna add in our dry ingredients actually before I do that I'm gonna sift these two together alright so I've got you know what I forgot how much flour I put in here so you have to forgive me I dunno I forgot how much that was too because I forgot I'm using a scraper instead of my whisk it's only forgot I'll have to look those up and I'll post it in the comments for you guys anyway flour and our baby photos so that's whisk together and actually take this off here anyway so I'm gonna make a mess at this point I'll just scoop this up at this point we can probably do this by hand so that's why your sugar goes in first so wet ingredients sift your dry ingredients and then add your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients so that looks pretty good alright so for my add-ins now if you don't like nuts and your cookies you can do just the white chocolate chips alright so I've got a cup of white chocolate just and I've got a macadamia nuts that I've chopped up and then I've got a half a cup of craisins now one of the things that usually really nice is take your crazes or raisins like it's gonna make oatmeal raisin cookies any time you're gonna put your craisins or raisins in baked goods if you take it then you soak them in water for a few hours there they become really nice and plump Wow we probably should taste it make sure it's good before we waste our time even baking it right it's delicious but I do not get a white chocolate chip in there so have another bite all right so and then I've got one of our stainless steel scoops here so one of the things I absolutely like this is the first thing I ever bought from camper truck and it is one of our pizza stones and for a long time I didn't use it because I like to make two or three pizzas at once and I didn't want to wait on the stone what I didn't realize is it is awesome for making things crispy like cheese sticks toasted raviolis I make cookies on here all kinds of stuff so now it just stays in the oven and because of that it's seasoned very well and it's black but that's good because they say the darker it looks the better it cooks normally I would use a teaspoon metal scooper but I'm gonna use the larger one today because these cookies are full of all those goodies all the chocolate chips or the white chocolate chips I should say the cranberries and the macadamia nuts and I write my cookies to be like really uniform I like them all to look the same and look like they came from a bakery so I feel like if I put him in a smaller stoop that I would have a hard time getting them all even because of all the little nuts and stuff all right so there we go now I don't know how much these are gonna spray out so I'm just putting four I'm here for right now and I'm just gonna Pat them down just like to try to they're nice and wound there we go all right so these are gonna go in the oven 375 most the time your cookies are you know eight to ten minutes so what I say is take them if you like them chewy especially you're gonna want to take them out at eight minutes because they're gonna have some continue or some carryover cooking they're gonna continue to cook for a little bit all right off to the oven all right so we've got our first batch of cookies getting ready to come out of the oven you smell amazing sometimes I let them set just a little bit just cuz they're usually easier to get off the pan but these are a little brown so I'm gonna try to get them off there as soon as possible I don't want them to cook any more than they already have so I'm gonna be very very careful okay it's not these pretty all right I'm just gonna let that cool there for a few minutes we feel like these look like lobster claws no I really should save these for dessert tonight but yeah look how pretty that is so of course I'm gonna take a bite dragon you want to take a bite a cookie well if you wanted saw hmm you get that super sweet bite I'm the white chocolate the crunch of the nut and then the chewiness of the cranberries I think this has inspired me to do a white chocolate macadamia cranberry cheesecake for Thanksgiving good yeah well he should know him in his daddy or Cookie Monster's so that is that I'm gonna finish up my cookies and I'll see you guys next time bye", "m2M6h7Wsa_0": "[Music] [Music] [Music]", "R5MPBwP5TvQ": "hi guys today we will be making white chocolate Oreo stuffed cookies let's begin in a large bowl add 3/4 cups of white sugar 3/4 cups of packed brown sugar and are this hard so cute 1 cup of butter or margarine softened 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 large egg then you're going to mix it with a beater or you can use a wooden spoon or regular spoon instead of using all-purpose flour I use something called self-rising flour which already had baking powder and salt in it so I didn't need to add it if you don't have self raising flour you can read more about what kind of flour you can use online blog which will be linked in the description box in the same bowl add 2 and 1/4 cups of self-rising flour then you're going to add the white chocolate chips continue mixing with a spoon after you finished mixing all the white chocolate chips crap one oreo and grab the cookie dough and you're going to roll it up into a ball once you're finished making two of them grab your Oreo and you're going to mash it together be careful not to press too hard because you

14 to 16 minutes and this is how it's gonna look like when it's finished transfer to cookie rack after 2 minutes sitting on the pan and go ahead and eat your cookie and this is how it's gonna look

back to a brand new video and today I'm sharing with you the only cookie recipe that you need if you like like a gooey chewy kind of not properly cooked but like crispy on the outside cookie I have found the perfect recipe I spent the last two days making a lot of cookies the leftovers here my friends are very excited that I'm eating them for dinner to my I'm just gonna cut them like bearing articles of cookies for all of them and I have stumbled across the best recipes so everything you need will be down in the description box below in terms of ingredients from the recipe but what we're trying to recreate here is like the classic if you've ever been to New York and you've been to levan Bakery you know what is up those cookies are like huge monsters they're really thick they're really big over post a photo here for you I went there twice I think I've been that once with Marc and once with Lee Lily isn't like a natural sweet tooth kind of gown to be fair neither is Marc he's not sweet to kind of go either but I am Pablo both if it's the best like I would go back to me or just have those cookies but a place has opened up in London I think he's called Annie pronounce it creme creme and it's been egg roll all the bloggers have been going and I went there and picked up a load of cookies for my birthday and they were delicious they were the talk of the town and all my friends have been asking you if I got a recipe that would likely create them at home so that is what I've been working on for them and I thought I would share it with you I've been posting stuff on Instagram and I just don't get as many replies ever that's when I post about creepy stuff so this one goes out to all my cookie lovers out there and then this morning I actually did a batch of white chocolate miso cookies which is one of the layers that creme do oh my word they are so so good and so I'm going to show you my little experiment but the results and to show you how we decided we're gonna bake today which is going to be milk chocolate and hazelnut so when I was posting my batches on Instagram stories yesterday they were just too flat like I couldn't get any height to them and like the levant bakery cookies are really quite chunky so I just wanted them to be like not so spread out on the baking tray I mean you guys came out of me with a ton of recommendations which was brilliant thank you so I split this batch that I did this white chocolate and me say back in half and I did one half using baking soda and baking powder so bicarbonate soda and baking powder because people recommended that like those two things all have a little chemical reaction that can create a bit more sort of puffs in your bakes so I gave that a go and then I put half of the back in the fridge for half an hour cooked them and then half the batch in the freezer for half an hour and then cook them freeze the ones that definitely turned out better but if you can see there's still not that thick on my work they also like gooey in the middle and then the ones that were put in the fridge just sort of cool a little bit a little bit burn Brown the outsides I feel like that wasn't the solution but I mean these cookies do store taste super good if you're into that with this half of the batch I added self raising flour instead of plain flour again that was another recommendation from you guys and then yeah the he's work really well so I did the same thing I put half of the batch in the fridge for 30 minutes and then half the batch in the freezer for 30 minutes and these one was like when you see them all together you can tell these ones have the most hyped to them like look at that oh my gosh it's going to go into it's gonna go into now so gooey in the middle if you don't like them as gooey in the middle as I do I would recommend turning the heat down slightly and just putting them in for a little bit longer these are quite a high temperature but they're bait for a really short amount of time so you get the crispiness you get the Browning but inside it is oh my god cooee heaven let's cut one in half and just see just to prove that they are super gooey [Music] that yes I couldn't leave a couple of hours ago now they're still like melty they are so good white chocolate me so it's such a good combination because white chocolate can be like a little bit too sweet but and the me so it's like salty I'm a sweet and salty popcorn bye oh yeah sticky yeah very good look at that so this is what we're gonna be baking and but the milk chocolate hazelnut version so first step is to cream the butter and the sugar together so because I was a very long baby for my birthday I was very highly given the KitchenAid from mark which is welcome so thank you Oh basically all I want to do these days is use it and so last night I think coming to be back to the cookies and this morning I made - yeah for watches cookies and I made cinnamon farmers with it and yet no human recommendation oh this is so fun it's wholly unnecessary but if you've got a hand mixer if you just wanted to use my hand hunted thing he can but it is really fun and it doesn't any felt my sound like on the grapes paper which is the best thing you get one is 225 grams of cold cubed unsalted butter and I was very proud of myself because I just cut wet the perfect 225 grams slice which so you can cut me don't go make this recipe and then here I've got hundred grams of golden caster sugar and then 200 grams of light brown Muscovado sugar I think that's what once I've used and three during all these batches you realize that the perfect cookie is like just all you need to do is like switch around ratios of sugar and flour is like finding the perfect amount the foes I felt this works really well so I'm just gonna put down the KitchenAid lock it in place and then I'm just going to start slow and then event eat this together so it like cream together and stop its thing oh so good thing it takes around four minutes but you can just finally know that good thing I'm just preparing the flour a blast like that has finished screaming oh one thing I should mention is this is like a recreation of a recipe that I found on a blog modern honey calm I will link that down below if you that rescue was polite LaVon they create the classic like chocolate chip crushed cookies I've adapted a couple of things but yeah that's a really good place to start and so one thing that's recommended was to use cake flour and which is Spanish for our good ol breakthroughs they do their own which is great so I'm just measuring out how much 180 grams something to do with the proteins it creates every like light and fluffy cake and then the other flower that I'm using again 180 grams is self raising flour so this is just the item that they had to hopefully get a bit more like rise out of the cocoon so it's not so flat and it doesn't spread as much it's the same amount and it worked I also converted all of the measurements from cut measurements in two rounds so quite handy but I thought baking is getting more precise measurement this way the next thing I need to put in my eggs so two eggs are going in so I'm just gonna scrape down the sides and also a little paddle before I throw in my eggs I've honestly wanted one of these since it's like me and my house we've been together so that is how long now nothing is seven years yet when I told Caroline that Mark had got me KitchenAid of my birthday she was having fun so she got me diamonds but seriously KitchenAid remove the mean right so I'm going to turn it up one egg natural last time I did it were asked the paddle wheel still moving and almost hit my angle so would not recommend doing that and you're just going to add one time give it a mix and then add the other and they might say I look like I'm doing this like weird way but I hope like me using the lemon the lemon juice or all over again it will make a horrible sound at this point like really wet and flat Ian that's been gross but and just like neither a moment so it goes really nice and creamy and like slightly lighter and that's all like adding to the potential air that you get it into your cookie getting close to the point where I want to eat it you want to see what it looks like now mm-hmm Thunder scraping down the sides again just to make sure it's all in there my gosh everyone I just stayed at a moment in all of it because I feel like it didn't look creamy enough and now is the point where you want to like be careful with nip singing on OpenX over blend all those want to be season so dancing do those okay I put flour earlier all I need to add a couple more things next goes in a teaspoon of corn starch corn flour I think that's the same thing and we just call it different things across the pond I would never perp and this into a cookie but quite a few of you recommended it in the inmates grab the ends and there's also partners rascally I just helped with the whole like thickening but without making the cookie like tough or dense at all and was it putting in a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and that just helps things to rise and give the and then the other one go art if you were doing like Mesa and one chopper cookies now you even are you know me so I use two tablespoons for this amount well this amount is going to yield like ten pretty massive cookies I'm working where we're putting in salt sometimes I feel like we could taste it in a bit like too salty but when I make these last might not really did a quarter teaspoon of salt and they weren't salty enough so this time I'm going to try and like eyeball 1/2 teaspoon in that produce and here I'm just going to mix it until the flour it just incorporated no longer because you've still got to mix in our chocolate and hazelnuts possibly after that so I'm just going to do it really like slow so it's just incorporated that is enough so that's prepares us is are we getting chocolate ready so then one honey recipe recommended 2 cups of chocolate chips which is 350 pounds of chocolate I can get behind I'm almost to like Mustafar we were going to buy this like fancy chocolate chips that it would have cost us like 10 pounds and chocolate just to make one bat so because I did not see that instead sounded like wooden trays chocolate we're just chopping it up into the medium its chunks I'm trying to get like each square in half just so the chunks aren't like massive but also it's so it's not super fine and it makes the dough kind of like brown you still what the toads be like think like that I also was really lazy and purchased the roasted chopped hazelnuts so these are all like ready to go I'm just going to baby 100 grams think I use about 100 grams of walnuts in the rescue that I did last night this should work completely fine and it's quite easy to top off throw those in okay okay time for a loop what do you prefer what do you think I cooked every day and I know what you and then in goes our last topic you know what it makes so many cookies as morning I actually I was on sweetie pie person and I'm really excited for summer okay so many cookies so much cookie dough I need some still combined so this is the final mix but like I said like a very low and slow mix it would probably be more raised to have mix this but I just want you can get them in different ways [Music] so here's where things get interesting and this is where my little experiment really helped me to I see the difference I would normally just throw my cookie dough into the fridge by like an hour and a half I mean overnight is apparently like what you should be doing that who has time for that when I make cookies I want to eat them like now immediately so I found was that the ones that had like the goofiest Center and therefore like the most kind of height so in them were the ones that I put into the freezer and only thing was put them in freezer for 30 minutes so they're not like completely solid but they are like pre so they're not sticky anymore when you get them out and that's me work really well but I would suggest like you do you do like if you want to do them in the fridge if you want to put them in three longer and here's me we experiment and get more when I spread out cookie if you want you to just cook them now fat to be preferred she'll be a bigger cookie or if you won but I really like kind of uncooked Center I would suggest throwing them in the freezer there you go let's tidy this up and get pools ready you can make these cookies as big or as small as you want to like some of the cookies I made last night that I was bigger but yeah they're pretty massive and these were like a big I think we're going to try and make them a little bit smaller say because I was trying to yield eight cookies out of the dough and I actually think more like ten is a bit more sense or like I love the look of that I feel like that is a little bit too big so I'm going to try to place five cookies on each plate and it's just a case of taken out you're not putting them into a ball you're not pressing them down you want them to be kind of high kind of operate right number ten is a little liking on a chocolate chips but it's cool it'll still be beautiful and I just have to clear enough space in your freezer for like two computer cookies which we can use that we've just popped in the one for now there you go there they are next to our fries and bagels and 1 p.m. now so they will be ready to cook in half an hour and then we just go up the other ones they're just chill in here that we ready to go would you like a little swap over and they will have half an hour as well so by like called past two everything will be cooked and cooled down I'm ready to eat right half an hour pretty pretty solid right let's get them on a baking sheet so I think a minute three cookies on this one space them out because there will be a little bit right and I've got the oven preheated at 180 I was doing that 200 but marketed say they were a little bit too undercooked in the middle and we don't want to give anyone like food poisoning don't give anyone does you some bikini right so we're gonna do 180 for 10 minutes and then who more like see where we're at see if they need a little bit longer you just want them to lightly brown on top that's what you're looking for and then when they lightly browned on top you can kind of assess they need a little bit longer you could always put some foil on the top so they don't catch any more but you're still kind of cooking them but without browning them and you can swap the trades around you can turn these around so this is where I like you've gotta have your own journey do that movie because every one of those ovens are going to be different all of that kind of stuff so you're just looking for lightly browned still quite high and obviously you can alter it depending on your personal tastes as whether you like things yeah get a real look at all these for maybe five minutes actually because then we can like swap them around on the shelves Mott's getting his lunch break in there I don't blame him that's gonna be me in about half an hour's time and it's we just took them out eight minutes definitely wasn't enough so I took them out I turned the top tray round and I've given them another two minutes so we run ten minutes so this is batch number one that I did or marks request at a slightly lower temperature for a little bit longer I was not doing about eleven twelve minutes these are on the bottom shaft these ones are on the top shelf so they've sort of spread out a bit more than the previous ones that I've made but there still is a little bit of height there there you go still a little bit of a chunk to it not so much the ones that were on the bottom shelf interestingly honestly cookie making it's an art guys everything just comes out a little bit different but I feel like this is when you want to pull them when they've got this slight browning on top they're like a caramel e Brown but these middles are not set at all so you just wait them to firm up on the baking sheet for maybe my 20 minutes before you take them off put them on a cooling rack or if you like me eat or five of them so these are from the second batch I'm not wild about the ones that were on the lower tray in the oven and so I think it's probably worth like a little top tip there is just worth doing a tray at a time you can just control the heat a little bit more or if these ones had like a lot of spread and I've got a little bit browner around the edges which is cool but here you go this is what I'm talking about look at that height that squidgy said Oh get that chocolate mousse yes yes you ready for this oh yeah gooey goodness I do like my extremely soft in the middle but if you want to give us on chewy rather than gooey let me just wrap it up maybe swipe 180 and do more sort of like 12 minutes in the oven and I would always take out cookie when it doesn't look done yet because a little bit on the tray but don't make very much cooking times and temperatures to find my perfect spread thickness texture think you've really died but for me this is just but to be utterly perfect this replaces my 50 monster recipe but like I mentioned all of the ingredients will be down below or recipes for this one I really like the hazelnuts in this a I think you get more of a unitary vibe from it which is nice but all the white chocolate of miso sounds weird it tastes delicious trust me if you make any of these tag me message me on instagram drop me a comment below let's just like share the cookie love because there are few things i love more in the world than cookies watching

bake lemon this is chocolate chip cookies very very easy you don't need a mixer very basic so first butter important that the butter that you will use is at room temperature so from the fridge in the basement one hour before you start mixing you would know if it's room temperature if it is spreadable spread so put it in the bowl [Music] and then you need brown sugar white sugar brown and white sugar but they have different characteristics yum brown sugar more contains molasses the molasses will contribute to the flavor and texture of your cookies [Music] perfect match it will create something really good so you mix it you can use your spatula or you can even use a silicone spoon for editing wooden spoon and as long as your butter is really at room temperature ma consistency you just mix this just until combined mix it again creamy or light and fluffy because if you do that your cookies will turn into a cake like consistency gusto mo di bachui and heavy so you just mix until makita mona and ingredients okay so that's it well mixed i just scrape it and then i'm going to put one piece of egg and keep on mixing again i'll try to stick with this spatula so you're going to beat this until it's very smooth hang up yo it look in baking we call this emulsified if it's being on different ingredients in consistency butter sugar brown and white and eggs different characteristics ingredients combined into one that is emulsified we need to be united as one so you see it's very nice and smooth once you have achieved this the next step is to combine your dry ingredients together i have here all purpose flour chocolate chips i'm using belgian chocolate chips this is bel colad which of course you can get from puratos walnuts you can replace this with almonds i'm using dark chocolate by the way because i don't like my cookies very sweet peru may contain from the chocolate you can also use milk you can even use white chocolate and you can use almonds macadamia pecans really up to you this is baking soda and baking soda hindi naman talaganya pina what it does baking soda is a neutralizer when you finally you mix sure so that you will get a nice spread paramegan and then using a spoon you just mix this together until combined you need to do this part because you want to coat the chocolate chips and the walnuts with flour doing so massive even and distribution chocolate chips and walnuts and also to distribute the baking soda very well by the way we are not putting salt because i'm using salted butter and then it goes [Music] spatula hello in mulan hangang smooth organic no problem cover it with cling wrap put it inside the fridge and put the delivered oven in two days three days up to one week inside the fridge bring it down to room temperature so this is just the right consistency and if you touch it if you touch it in this in it in bishop room temperature or it could be cool okay now so patu miguel canon once you no longer see any traces of flower the gilan muna and then i'm going to use mekong pipang flour i'm going to use an ice cream scooper this is 1.5 ounce ice cream scooper or petticoat so you scoop it you can use baking paper nala bibi is a supermarket nonstick parchment paper puyon milling and to give it enough space for air circulation during baking space social distancing or physical distance cookies but also how to practice physical distancing even for your cookies one recipe can create approximately 16 pieces of oven 350 degrees fahrenheit for 12 to 14 minutes back at 12 to 14 minutes after 12 minutes more than 14 minutes you want it chewy so do not over bake it's a salon and then i'll show you the finished product so after this is 14 so you might need to bake longer no so after 14 minutes in the baking shine as you can see almost dry nayo ibabao but do not over bake don't wait for the sides to turn very brown because you need to put it in a cooling rack um [Music] so that your cookies will cool down evenly so look at this you can easily take it out from the pan it's nicely baked oh look how moist that is i like to eat it with the milk oh texture i like to eat it with milk um and i look forward to seeing your products on social media as usual enjoy and stay happy", "-oJldMRvWjE": "hi everybody welcome back to my kitchen i'm amy from neurotic mom bakes and today is the best day ever because number one it's christmas eve for some of you it might even be christmas morning number two is i this has been so hard i don't know why it's a basic chocolate chip cookie but to get the perfect one boy did i have a lot of trial and error with this one um i scoured the internet and just kind of just looked and compared different recipes and they're all basic same ingredients right butter flour sugar eggs stuff like that but there were so many variations like do i melt the butter first do i keep it cold is it unsalted butter should i use salted butter baking soda versus baking powder or a little bit of both there just were so many factors some recipes called for chilling for two hours some wanted to chill for 24 to 48 hours i'm not a fan of chilling dough especially chocolate chip cookies because when you're in the mood for cookies you want them now you don't want to make them and eat them tomorrow because yeah you want chocolate chip cookies now so i have tweaked and tweaked and tweaked again and again so many times i can't even count to get the perfect consistency the perfect flavor perfect texture for this just you know basic chocolate chip cookie everyone's favorite so merry christmas my gift to you perfect chocolate chip cookie all right let's start so i am going with salted butter you can use unsalted butter i have tried this um salted butter just adds a little bit more flavor i am not melting my butter in fact i want it slightly cold not cold from the fridge but not melty at all so i'm going to put this in the defrost in the microwave just until i can barely barely press my finger into it barely barely soft now in here i have two thirds of a cup of granulated white sugar and then i need three quarters of a cup of brown sugar packed brown sugar there's a half and a quarter the other thing is is i like my hand mixer better i just have more control over how much things get mixed which is also very important now to get this butter to incorporate just right and easier is i will kind of cut it up into like eight chunks this is a half a cup of salted butter i'm going to use my hand mixer this takes a minute but you want to get it until it's fully combined all the butter is combined with the sugar again this just takes a minute more because that butter was kind of cold but it's worth it trust me you want the colder butter all right i think we're about there it just starts to come together there we go it just has come together you cannot see any chunks of butter at this point we will add one egg [Music] and two teaspoons of vanilla [Music] now here's an important step and this is don't over mix the egg that will make for a stiff cookie just get it until it's just barely creamed together there we go that's where i want it let's talk about measuring flour there are lots of different ways to measure flour you can scoop it you can weigh it however the best most accurate way is to kind of fluff your flour with a spoon and then spoon it in and that's what i'm going to do for this recipe i need two cups of flour because if you kind of pack it in there you're going to have more flour than you than you want and it's going to make a dry cookie two okay now in this recipe i'm going to use baking soda and baking powder so baking soda they are not the same thing not even close baking soda will make the cookie spread a little bit more which you want you want it to spread a little bit baking powder will give it some rise and make it fluffy so we're going to do a half a teaspoon of each of those baking powder and baking sodas is my half and a half a teaspoon of salt okay this you do not want to over mix you want to get it just mixed you'll see it'll be like a crumbly texture okay that looks really dry right very crumbly very dry that's what i want because here is my secret you're going to add one tablespoon of milk two if it's really dry maybe you over measured your flour just a little bit but one tablespoon of milk it'll just start to come together that's what i'm looking for stop right there because you're going to do the rest by hand but you can see it just start to come together you can handle it but it doesn't stick to your fingers now we add the good stuff after all this work use a high quality chocolate chip i have the ghirardelli just you don't have to but it really does make a lot of difference you can add nuts you can add white chocolate chips you can add butterscotch chips peanut butter chips whatever you like you can get like a really nice candy bar like a symphony bar and chop that up that would be really good i have done that before when i ran out of chocolate chips okay i think maybe a few more okay now the beautiful thing about this is you do not have to chill when a dough calls for chilling i'm i'm out especially chocolate chip cookies now we're ready to uh scoop them onto my tray i like to use an ice cream scoop you just get a nice round portion and they're all equal but totally feel free to get your spoon and spoon it onto here you can do a greased cookie sheet or use parchment paper i like parchment paper because you can reuse it three or four times and then you don't have to clean the pan just because i can't stand when my cookies run together or touch each other when they start to bake i'm only gonna do eight but they're gonna be nice big cookies and i'm actually going to after i do that i'm gonna kind of shape it a little bit more round and place it exactly where i want it so they don't run together and sometimes if it looks like it needs more like chocolate chip i'll stick another one in there a little bit more dough on this one these will go into a 350 degree oven for about 9 to 11 minutes now here's the other trick you want to take them out just a hair before they look done if you take them out when they look baked all the way through you've overdone it and they're going to be too crispy because they continue to cook on the cookie sheet so when they're just barely still wet in the center take them out and just like the tiniest hint of color on the outside take them out okay there it is my perfect chocolate chip cookie at least this is how i like them they're just thick enough just chewy enough full of chocolate chips just barely brown on the edges and the flavor that salted butter just makes all the difference that is so good so i want to know what you think i want you to give this a try give me some feedback let me know how you like it and how it compares to your chocolate chip cookie recipe that you normally make and then if you want to see more content and tutorials like this make sure to subscribe to my channel you", "wMNEWNbcuHI": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with chocolate chip cookies that's right this amazing recipe is by far the most closely guarded secret in the history of food wishes well actually that's not true the fact that my moustache is fake is probably really the biggest secret but food wise it's definitely these chocolate chip cookies and not only does this produce literally the perfect chocolate chip cookie it's also the easiest procedure I've ever seen and requires no electric mixer so let's go ahead and get started with the dry ingredients and for that we're gonna need some all-purpose flour yup no matter what your purpose this kind of flour will work and then to that we're going to add a spoon of baking soda not baking powder repeat not baking powder baking soda in fact I shouldn't even mention baking powder because now you're thinking about it and then last but not least of course we're going to need some salts and then what we'll do is we'll grab a whisk and give this a mix for about a minute so that everything gets incorporated evenly and this is more of a contemporary technique back in the day we would have had you put this through your sifter but you don't have a sifter but you do have a whisk so like I said we'll mix that up for about a minute at which point we'll simply set that aside and move on to the rest of the dough and that's going to begin with a little bit of butter just a cup and why is it so yellow because they let the cows eat grass like they're supposed to but anyway we're going to need a cup of butter and some very soft butter at that and it's this nice soft butter along with a heavy-duty spatula that makes this procedure so simple and electric mixer free so what we'll do is we'll add some white sugar and some brown sugar and once we add our sugar we will take the back of our heavy-duty spatula and begin to do what they call cream the butter in the sugar so we'll simply use the back of our spatula to smear and smush and smash that all together and things might start off a little slow but just keep at it and after a few short minutes of thoughtful speculation you should be looking at something that's very light in texture almost borderline fluffy and even though we're not going to use an electric mixer this really isn't going to take very long I mean this really should only take you a couple minutes and I'm including time to daydream in that okay but anyway like I said we're gonna cream all that together for a couple minutes until we end up with something that looks like this which way we can proceed with the rest of the ingredients so let's go ahead and add some vanilla extract of course we're going to use the real and the pure and then after the vanilla we'll do a couple tablespoons of milk and in the spirit of full disclosure I'm not even using real milk I'm using almond milk oh yeah chef John's a little more of a hippie than one would suspect so we'll do a little bit of milk and then we'll also need one large egg and then we'll grab a whisk and mix this all together and please take note how when I start off here I'm sort of keeping my whisk on one side sort of mixing one spot very thoroughly before moving on to another spout and the reason I do that is because there's a very small chance very small but a chance nonetheless that if we try to mix us all together too fast it can separate and not come together into the creamy mass we're looking for so by starting and staying in one spot until it kind of starts coming together you pretty much eliminate any chance that's going to happen so we'll go ahead and we'll give that a very thorough mixing with the whisk until that vanilla egg and milk are perfectly incorporated and once that's happened let's go ahead and switch to the spatula and we'll use that to clean up and scrape down our sides so we can move on to the final steps which are as follows let's go ahead and grab our flour mixture and dump it right in and then we'll take our spatula and mix that in which should only take a minute if that and do not worry about over mixing the dough this recipe requires exactly zero finesse really the hardest part about this step is not having the flour fly out of the bowl and then as soon as that flour has been successfully incorporated we will add to last and maybe most important ingredient the chocolate chips and of course semi-sweet is your classic choice but really any kind of chocolates going to work here except white chocolate I don't like white chocolate so we'll mix those in and then as soon as our chocolate chips are incorporated our dough is officially done and yes it can be used immediately but for best results I recommend transferring this into some kind of zip-top plastic bag and chilling it before we try to scoop it not only do I think the texture of the final baked cookie is a little better for reasons that I can't scientifically explain the cold front cookie dough is way way easier to work with then soft sticky room-temperature dough so I did refrigerate my dough for a couple hours at which point we'll pull it out and as suspected it was colder and firmer at this point we are ready to scoop and bake cookies and for me the easiest way to do that is one of these little sorbet scoops all right this one holds just about a rounded tablespoon which I find is the perfect amount because we chilled our dough in a bag it's very easy to stick the scoop in there grab the perfect amount of dough and then use the back to even it off so we don't have to get our fingers all dirty I mean what's worse than looking cookie dough off your fingers so that's my method although instead of scooping them onto a table what we really want to do is scoop these onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet and please do not crowd them I don't really think you should put more than 8 per pan so I'm gonna use the old classic - one two one two placement system then once we've scooped and evenly spaced our dough we will transfer that pan into the center of a 375 degree oven for about 12 minutes or until our cookies get beautifully golden brown around the edges and look like this check it out those look good and if everything's gone according to plan the outside of our cookies should be beautifully crisp not even though the outsides are crispy the cookie itself remains flexible moist and beautifully chewy so what I like to do is just slide them off using the paper onto a cooling rack just like that and those will firm up enough to handle in just a few minutes at which point we can lose the paper and ideally let these cool completely I know some of you like warm chocolate chip cookies that is your right you either Snooki of your cookie but I think to fully appreciate the texture and taste you should let these cool all the way down to room temp and by the way to kill time while I waited for my tea cool I decide to hold one up to the light so we can see just how thin these are and also kind of see that inner bubbly matrix that gives these cookies their incredible texture but anyway I did let my cool at which point it was time to taste what I consider the perfect chocolate chip which for me means the perfect balance between crispy and chewy which is exactly what I think we have here but don't take it for me listen for yourself and despite the outer edges being crispy the rest of the cookie is still flexible chewy moist and unbelievably delicious so anyway that's it the official food wishes chocolate chip cookie my sincerest apologies for making you wait eight years for this hey

about that probably the best way to describe it Sam here we chopped up the macadamia nuts and macadamia nuts have you come on your own I always think they're gonna be sweet but that's because I've only ever had macadamia nuts even cookies which I thought I just associate them with beings I hate macadamia nuts yeah you take some oh yeah I will eat around them and just throw them away but we just ate some just by themselves and they're actually so good I didn't know good living living alive yeah we added the macadamia nuts white chocolate mix it together we're gonna scoop out inch-and-a-half balls and jewels depends how big you wanna here I had them in balls I didn't like that they can still kind of held a lot of the shape together when I baked them okay so while I flatten them out a little bit so you saw balls there when you make them make the balls a lot in the mode a little bit to maybe half an inch thickness and then they'll come out looking like this here okay okay big times

of cookie you're into but this is a basically a ball of warm cookie dough with a vaguely crispy exterior it thick bastard this is a thinking man's cookie yes I like this car doesn't go 0-60 that fast but the people will literally ride either the line or a quarter into your lane and everybody's kind of they're like that's fine and I'm like this isn't this is not what I change the expect okay we're here in the beautiful Upper West Side at the original Levin cookie bakery Levin bakery I keep telling cookie Baker one of each cookie place yeah pay dirt [Music] all right let's dig into one of these mush look at the bottom looks great don't stick my thumb off Wow oh wow it's not exactly how I described it good no no it's just like it's just a lot better than I thought blowing my mind how good this is also having this like thicker texture is like you maintain sort of dewy liquidy chocolate that won't happen with it normally they probably go pretty light on the baking soda baking powder richness maybe more egg yolks maybe I don't know I really don't know it's kind of a well guarded secret so you're gonna try to recreate this at home I think I can do it so everybody in the world can experience this it's your turn to well that was fun now we're back in town and I think we're ready to take on this challenge or even get started just want to say a quick thank you to Benjamin Babbage Andrew thank you we appreciate you we love you and we kiss you and one more thing I have a collab video that went up on Babbage's channel there will be a link in the description but you should go click that and watch it it's bread you know you like that all right so not to flex but I actually got this right on the first try so I'm flexing a couple of important notes here the chocolate that you're using you want it to be relatively dark like 60 to 70% cacao so make sure that that's on the board no milk chocolate the second thing that you want is you want to use cake flour no all-purpose flour I don't want to hear substitutions please use cake flour you know how I feel about that cake so you gonna start off with one and a quarter cup for 280 grams of unsalted butter bring it to a melt with wait no you know what I mean so that's it aside and let it cool a little bit then rough chop one pound or 450 grams of dark chocolate but like a lot like this sort of some randomized pieces some big some small some tiny you know yeah in a medium-sized bowl combine one and a half cups our 230 grams of cake flour and two cups or 275 grams of all-purpose flour why don't have teaspoons are 5 grams of kosher salt and 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of cornstarch and a half a teaspoon or 6 grams of baking soda give that some whiskey whiskey to stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and yes you can do this by hand in a regular bowl with a whisk don't worry AB one on 1/4 cup or 285 grams of brown sugar light brown sugar and half a cup of 115 grams of white granulated sugar begin whisking down on medium speed and then slowly stream in your butter what's that all together until it looks nice and creamy like this then to that one egg at a time you're gonna add two eggs followed by three egg yolks making sure to incorporate them in between each egg of course and once you've got a nice smooth homogeneous little thing going on here switch to the peddle attachment and then mix in your flour mixture don't forget to spill a bunch of flour all over the place when you're pouring into your mixer because for some reason mixtures are built this way in such a way that you always spill flour I don't know I'm blaming the mixer instead of myself that's just how it goes what's your dough is nice too smooth go ahead and fold in two cups are 165 grams of rough chopped walnuts I'd recommend toasting your walnuts by the way and your chopped chocolate and also uh maybe don't do this in a machine because it's a little bit rough on your machine soda and there you go there's your nice little cookie dough now number one tip with these if you want them to be tall you need to chill these so wrap them up and put them in your refrigerator for at least 45 minutes the longer you chill them the taller they'll be I mean you can only give them so cold but you see items like sofas Ward and you've got your chili boy right now we need to talk about scooping scooping is very very important here upon further research I found on their website that their cookies typically average around 6 ounces in size so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna make a six ounce cookie ball and you want these balls to be tall I know this sounds weird but I found that a Vollrath four round stainless steel Disher works really well if you stuff it in there really nicely oven like the description for that if you want to use that if you don't have a scale whatever do what you want to do but get nice balls okay then just arrange them onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper I had six here I'd recommend doing four on each tray just to have extra room if you want these to be extra tall I would recommend refrigerating them for 25 more minutes I did not and you will see the minor consequences in a bit next you're gonna place them into an oven set to 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 220 Celsius yes very hot for 10 to 13 minutes or until lightly browned on the outside you want the inside to be a little bit underdone that's the goal here and so here they are here's a little side-by-side just for comparison I think we did pretty good here guys you know considering we got this on the first try and they're pretty darn close let's say they're about 85 to 90 percent of the way there in terms of similarity but do you want to know what it is a hundred percent of the way there [Music] or guys and that is it so I feel pretty good about this I don't think that they were perfect I think they could have been a little bit taller and I think if you wanted them taller you just need to chill the dome much longer I only shelled mine for about 30 or 45 minutes again thank you so much to Andrew up way cave inching with babish everybody calls him babish yeah Bradley own he calls him Bobby hey Bradley only if you're watching cuz kiss love you hit me up that was a ton of fun Babbitt hello that or should I have been talking for a while I've hinted at it a bunch everybody kind of already figured it out pretty early on so thanks for that I'm also doing a collaboration on his channel there will be a bread video over there like I said earlier be sure to go check that out there will be a link in the description but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time also don't forget to subscribe to babish too these are the freaking description bro go go get that that DEP button please [Music]", "hqswc-Oy4yQ": "[Music] hey everybody and welcome to the crimson doilies once cake factory now packing factory we've been so busy here over the last couple of weeks turning this place from like making hundreds and thousands of cakes and cupcakes to packing up hundreds and thousands of cake kits that you guys have been bet buying from the cupcake jammer website and you have bought so many and you've been baking along and posting your photos and videos on Instagram which has just been absolutely awesome so we kind of thought what else can we give you guys to bake at home and something that occurred to us is there sometimes cake can seem a little bit scary because you've got sponge you've got icing also maybe you don't really need 12 cupcakes if you're at home isolating alone 12 cupcakes can seem like quite a lot so we thought the perfect thing for you guys is cookies and hopefully you guys have been following us for some time now and you'll know that it comes as oles and so ho we've been selling huge amazing decadent soft gooey warm New York style cookies because a few of us have been to New York recently and we discovered these cookies and we all fell in love with them and we just had to recreate them and you guys have loved them you've been watching our videos we'll put links to all the recipes and videos in the description box below but we want to make sure that you can bake these at home loss during isolation so we have created three cookie sets for you and they look like this and inside just like the cake kiss we've got everything you need other than a little bit of fresh ingredients so if we open up our box we've got the recipe inside here we've also got a list of ingredients on the back if you want going to check that make sure that everything's you know suitable for you or your kids or whatever and then there's a list of what you guys need to buy as well for cookies is literally just butter and eggs so really simple and we've got a bag of sugar mix here there's a couple of different sugars in this so we've already kind of combined them for you we've got the dry mix so we've got the flowers the salts the raising agents we've double chocolate version which has got black cocoa in which you know maybe we'll do a video for that as well because it's just like the coolest stuff ever and we've also got chocolate chips which is chocalate chips for like 300 grams of Callebaut chocolate which is exactly the chocolate that we use here in the bakery it's so like super high quality and it's delicious so you're getting a lot from these kits and as well as that we've even included some baking paper so you don't need to kind of like rush to the stores and try and find baking parchment there's two pieces in here for you as well so everything you need and you know hopefully you kind of seen some of the other recipes Dunphy's and you know how simple it is it's really really easy you do not need to be any kind of expert Baker for these so I'm gonna just run you through this it's so easy maybe you will have your kit already and you can bake along so we're gonna start by using it some cold butter so I've got 190 grams here I'll put all the quantities in the description box so if you don't have the kit you can still bake along as well and it's been it's nice and cold and I've chopped it into little pieces here so they're gonna go into my mixer I'm using a mixer just because it's a kind of easier you don't again don't need to have one if you can just use their like a hand whisk or a wooden spoon because the beauty of this recipe also is that it's so easy to make a we're not trying to cream we're not trying to beat we're not trying to whip we are just combining and that's what creates the kind of tear apart chunky cookies so it's really really simple guys so I'm gonna put this all into my mixer and then I'm going to open my sugar pack here on the back we've got the S on the back of your ingredients you'll see they're kind of like labels of like what each pack means basically so Eska sugar and we're going to open this up and we're going to tip it all into the mixer and now all we need to do is turn this on to a low speed and what we're going to do is just kind of create some nuggets with the sugar and the butter like I said earlier we're not creaming this we're not beating this we just want to kind of combine the ingredients [Music] right so about 45 seconds at the most that's with a mixer if you are working wooden spoon and Bowl might take you a bit longer but what you want to end up with is these nuggets like I said before there's some nice big chunks of butter in there kind of coated by the sugar and that is perfect now we're going to add our chocolate chips so open up your chocolate chip bags like I said earlier there's 300 rounds of chocolate in here because I mean that's the most important part of a chocolate chip cookie right so I'm going to put all of this into the mixer and then we're just gonna give that another maybe like 30 seconds just we're going to spread itself around the batter and how P it's a mixer by the way you might have seen this in our and mixer review that we did last week and this was Gemma's 1 obviously I mean it literally says cupcake gem around here don't tell her I'm in home except but you can see all about this mixer and what we think of it and you know some other ones that we reviewed as well so have a look at that especially if you're thinking of getting yourself a mixer as you can see in here the chocolates just kind of like separated all around the mixture and now we can go in with our dry mix so we've got the flour we've got some raising agent and a little bit of salt in here and we're going to tip that into the mix as well [Music] and then we're gonna go back on with a mixer on a low-speed again and we're just going to get this to a kind of bread crumb stage it's going to look quite kind of dry kind of a little bit like when you're making pastry and you're kind of rubbing the butter and the flour between your fingers that's what we're looking for [Music] okay sir just like I said the breadcrumb consistency as you can see here obviously you've got chunks of chocolate in there and but apart from that looks nice and kind of fine so now we need to add our final ingredient then that is eggs so you need two eggs it doesn't matter what size you've got Lars runs if you've got small ones or medium any sized egg will do and what we're gonna do before we put them in it's just going to give them a little whisk just to break them up so that we don't have to kind of mix too much the whole point like I said earlier is really not over mixing just combining ingredients so eggs are broken up and I'm going to pour them straight in and then back on for a final mix on the slow speeds and we're just going to get this till it comes together as one big dough's it's coming away from the sides of the bowl nice and clean [Music] and that is it the cookie dough is amazed but if you've seen some of our cookie recipes and videos before you wanna know that these need to freeze for a bit so what we're gonna do is we're gonna divide the batter into 12 equal balls it just going to be around 100 grams each and I'm going to put them in a Tupperware so if you've got a Tupperware or a tray that you can cover grab yourself one of those so it turn my scales on and I'm gonna weigh out a hundred grams and then we need to make these into balls but what we're not going to do is make nice kind of spherical round cause we're just going to gently squish them a few times between our hands and you know it looks kind of chunky and not very round but that's exactly how we want it this is how you're going to get those delicious tarry chunky cookies and pop it into your Tupperware and we're just going to keep doing that till we've used all the dough and you might have noticed that this is a these are a little bit smaller than the cookies that we've done in the other recipes because we thought you know they are quite large and if you've got 12 of them and you're all alone maybe you don't really want to be eating huge cookies or if you've got kids this is like the perfect size for everybody [Music] so this does make 12 but you might find that it makes kind of 13 or 12 and a half depending on the size of your eggs that's completely fine you can either you know make an extra cookie or you could divide this between the cookies you've already made I'm just gonna make a little small one for a midnight snack one day so now what we need to do is put these in the freezer and a couple of hours at the minimum but really overnight is best it's just going to give them a chance to really kind of get nice and solid which means that they won't spread as much when they're in the oven but the best thing about this is that you can leave these in the freezer for like up to three months which means you have like unlimited cookies at your disposal like 24/7 so if you fancy a cookie you can just take one out and bake it because that is absolutely fine I think anyway don't let anyone tell you that it's not fired so we're gonna go and put these in the freezer I have some already in there so we can get baking straight away so when you are ready to bake your cookies what you need to do is pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees C and what you need to do five minutes before you want to bake your cookies is pop in your baking tray any kind of baking tray will do with a bit of the baking parchment on it that we've provided in the kit and that's just going to get the train nice and hot so the bottom of your cookies are going to get really nice and crispy and then just pop on as many cookies as you like we've got six of the gang in today so I better make sure I've got one for everybody then maybe a couple extra and then we're gonna put them in the oven for about 12 to 14 minutes and what you want to look for is the outsides to go nice and golden and the inside is gonna stay all gooey and delicious [Music] I mean they smell amazing and they look amazing too look at that they're nice and golden on the top they're all cracked and chunky so obviously these are really really hot so we're gonna wait about 20 minutes until they've cooled down a little bit but I want to eat them when they're still warm because that's my favorite time to eat cookies so we'll see you in a bit [Music] okay so they have cooled down just enough so that when I eat them they're still gonna be nice and warm because that is just how I like my cookies so before I eat it we better get that classic cookie break shot which you guys have been baking these already and you're uploading your kind of break shots onto Instagram and we love seeing them so you've got to make sure you do that when you bake these so let's have a look inside oh it looks amazing and I mean I know that these are amazing because I actually ate one for my breakfast with a cup of coffee this morning but I'm gonna eat one for you guys to prove how good they really are they are the best cookie you will ever eat and because of our wonderful kits we've done most of the work for you so all you need to do is mix it all together pop on your freezer and then you've got cookies at your

"IXdFucjekq8": "- It's cookie season, bro. So what are you bringing to your family and your friend's house\nthis holiday season? I'm gonna show you how to make\nthe most insanely delicious loaded-up chocolate chip\ncookies of all time, and I'm gonna do it in partnership with my friends over at Bob's Red Mill. So I used to work at this\ncountry club way back in the day and we made the most bomb cookies ever. I'm gonna recreate them. It's been 20 plus years. It's crazy that I've never\ndone a cookie recipe on here or even on my website, so now\nit's time to get after it. To start this recipe off, I'm gonna add some\nsoftened unsalted butter to a standing mixer. You can absolutely just add them to a bowl if you've got an electric hand mixer. Next, hit it with some sugar, sprinkle in some packed light brown sugar, and komies, the trick to moist,\ntender, delicious cookies is and has always been brown sugar. You may never have heard that before, but I promise you, that's where it's at. You can do all brown\nsugar or a combination, which is what I did. I just think you get both sugars in there, it makes it really moist\nand super flavorful. Now on low speed, let's go ahead and start mixing that together. We wanna cream the butter, make sure it's nice and\nsoft and light and fluffy. It's gonna take about\nfive to seven minutes, so just after a minute or two, go ahead and crank the speed\nup to medium or medium high, and get that stuff whipping. And when it comes to cookie-making, because all the stuff keeps\ngoing up the sides of the bowl, you need a rubber scraper because you're gonna need to\nscrape it at least one time before we add in some other ingredients. But while this is mixing\ntogether, like I said, it takes in between\nfive and seven minutes, let's go ahead and start\nmixing up our dry ingredients, starting with our flour. I'm gonna be using Bob's\nRed Mill All-Purpose Flour. Just a fantastic all-around flour, enough protein for really rustic breads, delicate enough for cookies and cakes. It's gonna be excellent in this recipe. Next, we're gonna sprinkle in\na little bit of baking powder, gonna help it rise up a bit. Some baking soda and a little bit of salt, we want it to be seasoned to perfection. Using a whisk, just simply combine all of these ingredients together. No need to go nuts here, just mix it. Now let's head over to our\ncreamed butter and sugar mixture. It's beautiful, it's light, it's fluffy. Now we gotta add in a few more things. We're gonna add in one large egg at a time until it's mixed in before\nadding the other one. Hit it with a little\nbit of vanilla extract. And now we're gonna add\nin our dry ingredients in three batches. So go ahead and add in\nyour first part of it. If you see flour is going everywhere, just turn the speed\ndown a little bit lower. We don't wanna blow your\nkitchen up with baked goods. And add a little bit bit more, and at this point, we're\ngonna stop and scrape again. We wanna make sure all those\nthings are completely combined. Then just finish it off\nwith that last little bit of dried ingredients until it is mixed in. At this point, lift that paddle mixer out. We're gonna scrape it really\nwell with a rubber spatula, get all that goodness. Take the time to do\nthis off of that paddle. Now take the bowl off, because I'm gonna fold in\nthese last ingredients, and the reason I'm doing this\nis when it's on the mixer, sometimes it can break it up too much, and then I'm missing those chunks of these last few ingredients,\nand I don't like that. So, in that bowl, I'm gonna start by adding in some semi-sweet chocolate chunks/chocolate chips, you can use either, you can use both. The reason I use both of them is I'm literally trying to\nclean out some of the cabinets and I had a little bit of both. Next, some white chocolate chunks. Again, you can use chips, no problem. We're gonna hit it with those nice little colored candy chocolate-filled goodies. Yeah, these are those one\ncandies that comes after L&Ls. Got it. Next, hit it with some\npeanut butter chips, and then last but not\nleast, for a little crunch, I've got some chopped up walnuts. We're gonna add them in there. Grab that rubber spatula and begin folding all of this goodness together. Now I'm not saying you should take a bite because it's got raw eggs in there, but you should maybe take a\nbite, because it's ridonculous. So finish mixing in all\nof those ingredients, and then what we wanna do is scoop some up and place it on a cookie sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Now I'm gonna be using a\nthree-tablespoon scoop. Yes, this is big, I'm making big cookies. And I think that's maybe my\nproblem with Christmas cookies. Yeah, they're delicious,\nbut I need 75 of them. They're all about the size of a nickel. It's not me. I like those sub sandwich shop cookies. You know, when you go\nin, you order your sub, and you're like, \"I'll take that cookie,\" and it's like this big and that thick. That is what I like, and if you don't like\nthat, simply cut it in half when you're making up these\ncookies on the sheet tray, okay? I like big fat cookies,\nthis is how I'm gonna do it. I got about six to a cookie sheet tray. It's going in the oven on 350 degrees. It's gonna take in\nbetween 16 and 18 minutes. The trick to always have\nnice, tender, moist cookies is slightly under-cooking them in the oven so that they're finished\nwhen they're carrying over on your countertop. And in case you didn't use\nall the cookie dough batter, what you can do is freeze it. So go ahead and add your\nleftover cookie dough right to a large piece of parchment paper. Kind of form it to a sort\nof cookie dough roll or log, and then we're gonna\nroll it up really well. Twist the edges so when you need it, all you would do is simply\nslice maybe a half-inch off each piece, lay it\non that cookie sheet tray lined with parchment paper, and bake it. Pull it out of the\nfreezer when you need it. This is awesome. Throw it in there, it'll last\nup to three months in there. Now let's take a look at our cookies, 'cause they are finished and, dude, awesome, they are perfect. They gotta a nice little light brown edge around the outside, they're soft, they're moist, they're\ntender in the middle. This is what we're\ntalking about, my friends. It's all about understanding these little basic cookie techniques so that you can make anything\nhomemade from scratch. Just like in these cookies,\nthe secret is brown sugar. That's why they are so good. It will taste better than\nanything you're gonna get at a restaurant, I can promise you. These are amazing, they're easy to make, done in less than 30 minutes. Where else can you do that? And if you've got a bit of a sweet tooth, then definitely check out\nmy overnight cinnamon rolls, 'cause they are so bomb. And I'll see you on that video.", "PF8hOyADPps": "hi everybody and welcome back to the crumbs and doilies kitchen here in london now if you were watching last week with the salted caramel cake recipe at the very end i promised that my good friend dane might be popping back to the kitchen sometime soon and i keep my promises so look who is back i'm back yay which is super exciting because he's not been here for like four months nearly yeah like over a hundred days which is just madness and we haven't actually got debate together we did bake over the internet one yeah that was fun it wasn't quite the same as being here i know and sort of being so close to each other you're almost in touching distance but stay away and so obviously we're gonna make cookies together because i mean we can bake other stuff but we're cookie pals yeah so we're gonna bake our brand new cookie recipe which is called the matcha dainia yeah i mean we appropriately renamed it the matcha dania because it's my comeback cookie so why not change it to matadania macadamia which basically is matcha and macadamia nuts which are a delicious buttery nut and matcha powder which is this stuff here is like a japanese green tea powder yeah they make it as a paste and then they slap it around and then they dry it in a big big bat somewhere i have no idea if this is true but we just doesn't roll with it and it's amazing um you can get it in like soft serve and i don't know they make all sorts of amazing stuff with it over there in japan but we're making cookies today so we're just going to talk you guys through it and um because we're both here i'm going to do it in the stand mixer because i'm lazy but we just want to prove to you guys that you can do this without a stand mixer so yeah i'm just going to do it in a bowl with a wooden spoon yes so we're going to start as usual yeah with our butter and our sugar so in here we've got chopped butter which is cold as usual that's quite important for these and so i'm going to put mine in my mixer i'm going to pop it in my bowl yes and we're going to go straight in with the sugars so we've got a mixture as usual of light brown sugar and um white sugar yeah so tip that in as well okay so what do we need to do first so we just need to break up the butter and sugar until it's nice and nuggety we're not gonna cream anything together these are my wooden spoon it's a race it's a break so if you're doing with a stand mixer you just want to put it onto a low to medium speed um and yeah like dane said you don't want to cream it we just want to make those nuggets right i'm pretty happy with mine but uh how's it going over there i'm not far off you know i'm actually very impressed with your um speediness yeah um my technique this is quite a long wooden spoon so what i'm doing is i'm not holding it up here because you'll have quite a hard job to go at the butter and sugar but i'm holding it lower at the at the base of the wooden spoon i'm just kind of jabbing at the ingredients and kind of mushing it against the bowl to break it up he literally is a pro at everything brilliant um so let me show you what we mean by buttery sugary nuggets so as you can see we've got these big chunks here and there's some blobs of butter in there as well and this is exactly how we want it you don't want it to be kind of all creamed and smooth okay are you ready for the next stage i am ready so mine is looking a little bit similar it's looking very similar to yours and they've got those chunky nuggets in there of butter and sugar and it's not creamed brilliant that is perfect so we're going to go in with the additions now and we're going to go with some white chocolate because i mean i claimed before that all cookies need chocolate and then i took it back when we made it but i really think the white chocolate is perfect in these cookies so we have 200 grams of those but we've also got the macadamia nuts also known as the macadania macadamia yeah you're going to rename the nut as well yeah okay cool we'll let everybody know and we've got um it's about 75 grams of these and they're quite large so these are macadamia house but they're still quite big so we're actually going to roughly chop them up but you don't have to do this so just with a chopping board and a knife obviously you could do it in a food processor or put them in a bag and whack give them a good whack with the rolling pin there we go so they are nicely chopped they're still quite chunky and what you could do further to this to make it even more special is roast them leave them for like 10 minutes and just amplify the flavor that was a good tip with all nuts actually like it pulls out so much flavor doesn't it when you bake them a little bit there we go that's why we invite these things okay so we'll tip both of these and the chocolate into the mixer yep and as sally said with the chocolate not all cookies have to have chocolate in but the white chocolate in this kind of just offsets the bitterness from the matcha because these are quite sweet cool so we've got 200 grams going straight in and then we just need to mix those through um again just to kind of um evenly distribute it between around the batter we're not gonna whip this up or beat it you've probably heard us saying this so much but it's the most important thing about these cookies is not to over mix [Music] okay so just about 30 seconds or so is yours done it's done fab so now we're going to go in with the dry ingredients next so in this bowl we've got some flour with some raisin agent in it and we'll put the full recipe for this in the description box below so head on down there so that's going to go in the mixer and then we need to add the exciting part which is the matcha powder so i'm going to go with a nice rounded tablespoon of this into my mixer and then i'll pass it to you yep oh hang on and if i put it there i'm also going to add one teaspoon of salt and then i'll pass that to you look at this okay so that's going in and then we're going to mix these again on the lowest speed and what we're looking for here is like a breadcrumb consistency yeah and you're going to do that with the wood with a technique to come with it yes hopefully i've got a big enough bar so if you're working with stand mixer like me it'll probably take about 45 seconds or something and you'll have this nice bread crumb consistency obviously with the nuts and the chocolate in there as well how are you doing over there that's good so what i've been doing um because i'm doing it by hand in a bowl i'm just kind of rotating the bowl and then i'm going around the edge with the wooden spoon just to incorporate it nice and gently lovely it's not going everywhere but we are ready great okay so last ingredient is eggs and that's what's gonna bind these cookies together as usual um so what we're gonna do first is break them into a bowl can you double egg i can't double egg but let's see you do it i know you can do oh no now the pressure's on okay here we go ah yes nice come on should i try yeah yeah [Laughter] whisk these up so that they've broken up completely and then took them into the mixer [Music] right i think it's sufficiently whipped up yeah so now we'll tip these in and we're just going to turn it on again to the lowest speed and bring it all together okay so i'm just putting my mixer on to the lowest speed and i'm going to stop mixing and once it's formed a dough and if you're using a mixer your mixer will probably start struggling and it's at that point you want to stop it and if you're doing it by hand if you're doing it by hand i just made a little well in the center poured my egg in the middle and then i'm just going around the same technique as i did with incorporating the flour just around the edge of the bowl just to mix it in and then if i feel like it's not really coming together i'll just get in there with my hands i've got gloves on so nice and easy cool so mine i'm winning by the way in case you're wondering mine is done so you can see it's formed a lovely sticky dough which we will ball up in a minute but we'll just let dane catch up yeah and then when your dough is ready it's time to ball it so you're going to need some scales um i've got mine under here yeah you've got yours you're ready i'm still going i'm probably about 20 seconds away okay well i will clear my space so as well as a set of scales you're going to need um a tupperware or a tray or something that you can cling wrap because the other important thing about these cookies is that you need to freeze them because what freezing does is it means that when they bake they're going to stay nice and chubby and it means that the outside will go nice and crispy and the inside will stay really gooey so it's really important that you freeze them we like to do it overnight but kind of two hours two hours minimum yeah but it's worth it i promise yeah so scales scales are on okay now i'm gonna do mine at 100 grand balls okay i'm going to do mine a little bit bigger 125. yeah classic old school style so set your scales on properly oh 126. i've still got the magic clearly after all this time he's been at home bacon cookies like all the time right now we're always sending him cookie kiss okay 101 oh yes so and once you have got your weight your preferred weight we need to bore them and now we're not rolling these are we no so all i'm doing is grabbing like a little clump um an estimated 125 grams and then all i'm doing is just clumping it together like this just pressing it really lightly so it's kind of a rough rugged shape and then popping it in the box cool and what that does is that kind of you know if you if you've made these or if you came to soho when we were open um you know the cookies are very kind of chunky and you can tear them apart really easily and that's achieved by doing this just very kind of gently squishing them together they don't look round but that's ooh that's exactly how you want them so you just want to keep going until you've build all your cookies yeah and um if you're having any troubles with your cookies nikki coin did a really great cookie 101 like troubleshooting kind of master class on and over on cupcake gemma's instagram on the highlight so if you go under where her profile is the little round dots click on that cookie 101 and she goes through all the kind of troubleshooting options that might happen with your cookies yeah so if you're kind of rolling them too much or if your butt is too soft at the beginning yeah she goes into kind of everything yeah or if they're a little bit too flat they're not sometimes your cookies don't spread and i'm like why i don't i don't understand but she's got all the answers so go and watch that so if you don't believe us she's got the proof yes [Laughter] [Music] right right done done cool i have more cookies than you ah well mine a bit bigger so all right so like we said we need to put these in the freezer did you just stick your tongue i did i saw it on the corner okay so freeze that overnight if possible the best thing about these is you can leave them into the freezer for like three months yes three months so just pop a cookie a single cookie whenever you want it yeah exactly but don't worry we have a freezer absolutely packed full of cookie balls here so let's head straight to the oven and we'll get some in yeah okay so we've got our preheated oven at 180 degrees got two baking trays in here that are for two different sizes of cookies because they're going to take different times to cook sally's putting hairs on that are a little bit smaller they'll take about 14 minutes and my slightly larger ones will take about 16 minutes yeah but obviously just kind of keep an eye on them and what you're looking for is a nice sort of slightly golden outside so we will take them out when they're ready yep okay [Music] [Music] so they have come out of the oven they've cooled down and we did one of each so that you guys could see just how they look if you do them in the mixer or by hand and i think it's safe to say that they both look amazing yeah they look exactly the same they do except you're a little bit smaller than me all right i know i made a mistake i should have gone bigger it just means i can eat more anyway shall we break one open yes let's do it okay [Applause] they look so good nice and gooey in the middle yeah it's still wet but that lovely crispy outside the whole like greenness you can really see that you've got that lovely crisp outside edge and then the perfect amount of goo in the middle yeah and i love the contrast between the white and the green too it's really cool all right ready let's go okay [Music] so good that's so warm [Music] it's like a really subtle matcha flavour yeah it's perfect and you get the crunch from the nuts and from the obviously the outside of the cookie as well yummy we taste it obviously of course we aced it and and you guys can definitely bake these at home um but obviously well not obviously there's always matcha powder it's quite hard to find as well as macadamia nuts or maybe you have to buy them in like kilos and you don't really want keyless so we do have the matcha demia slash matcha dania whatever you want to call it um on the cupcake gemma website as a kit and you get everything in it you get all the macadamias the white chocolate the flour mix which has obviously got the matcha powder in it it looks really cool um so you can head over there and get one yourself in the meantime we'd better come up with some more cookie recipes yes or if you guys have some ideas then please let us know yeah definitely comment down below if you want us to create any more exciting cookie flavors unfortunately i know a lot of you want peanut flavored cookies well both of us are correctly allergic so sorry i'll have to find someone else to do peanut cookies for you um but we'll be back soon together hopefully you're back now so sorry you can't i know i can't there's no escaping now yes um but yeah we'll see you guys soon with another recipe enjoy making these cookies you", "w7asMOP5WpM": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Gioia baking calm today we're going to make chocolate chip cookies and this is what they look like these cookies are wonderfully buttery sweet the edges are nice and crisp yet the center's are soft and chewy and of course they're full of chocolate chips so the first thing that you will need to do is to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit which is 190 degrees Celsius and then you will need a couple baking sheets you can line them with parchment paper like I've done here or you could just lightly butter them and then to make our batter if you have a stand mixer like I do use your paddle attachment you could use a hand mixer for this or really you could just use a large bowl with the wooden spoon the first thing you will need is one cup which is 225 grams butter I like to use unsalted one because I like the flavor and two I like to control the salt but if you have a favorite salted butter then just go ahead and use that and you want your butter at room temperature so I'm just gonna put that in there and I'm just gonna beat it on medium speed just until it gets nice and smooth [Applause] okay and when you're making any batter periodically scrape down the sides and the bottom of your bowl to mix we want to make sure everything gets mixed together so next you will need three-quarters of a cup which is 150 grams of granulated white sugar and 3/4 of a cup 160 grams of light brown sugar and if you're not weighing your sugar then make sure you really Pat it down in your measuring cup and then I'm going to add one and a half teaspoons six grams of pure vanilla extract that's simply for flavoring and I'm just gonna mix this on medium medium-high speed just until everything gets mixed together and we get a little bit of air in our batter not too much so maybe a minute or two [Music] okay that looks good so this is what you're looking for just everything's mixed together a little bit of air so you know you can do this by hand because it's not like we have to beat this batter for a long time so now we're going to add two large eggs which is a hundred grams heavier eggs at room temperature I'm going to add one beat that in and then add the second one [Music] hey let's get that a scrape okay so now for our dry ingredients I have in a bowl two and a quarter cups which is 295 grams of all-purpose flour you may know that as plain flour to that I'm going to add one teaspoon four grams of baking soda baking soda not only gives your chocolate-chip cookies a little bit of lift but it also helps to give the edges nice and crisp which I like and then you will need 1/2 a teaspoon 2 grams of salt now if you used a salted butter I would just leave out that salt and then I'm just gonna whisk that you want to make sure that baking soda and salt is really mixed in to your flour and then I'm just gonna dump that in and then of course we need chocolate chips whoops so I'm gonna put in 1 and 1/2 cups which is 270 grams of chocolate chips that's about the amount I like of course if you want more you could add more so you can use you know there's different chocolate chips or semi-sweet there's bitter sweet there's milk chocolate there's white chocolate my preference here is to use a bittersweet and the reason I like that is because you know the batter let's face it is a little sweet so I find that you know using a bittersweet chocolate chip kind of counters that sweetness of the batter or you know another thing they could do is to act like use a combination you know maybe some bittersweet with some semi-sweet or maybe white so you know experiment and you know it depends what your family likes as well so now what I'm going to do is mix this on low speed just until everything gets all combined okay we're done okay scrape all that so now if we're going to bake off our chocolate chip cookies right away you don't have to you can specially you know if you're in a warm kitchen which I am but we're gonna bake them off anyways if your batter is a little soft and cover it and put it into the refrigerator maybe thirty sixty minutes before baking actually what you can do if you don't want to bake all of these off today because this this probably makes somewhere between 30 and 35 cookies so you might not want to unless you're baking for some occasion you might not want to bake them all off you can actually leave this batter in the refrigerator for a couple of days so when the kids come home and they want a freshly baked cookie you can just do that so now I'm going to like I'm making fairly large cookies maybe they're about three inches which is about seven and a half centimeters you can make them any size you want the only difference will be in the baking time and I'm using about two tablespoons of batter so if you have an ice cream scoop that is about two tablespoons use that because that way if every cookie the same size and plus it's a lot easier to make them and that would be about if you wanted to weigh each cookie be about 35 grams now I'm not putting a lot I'm only putting about six cookies on my baking sheet because they do spread you could probably put up to about eight but I'm just gonna do six today and then because I'm using these they're little mounds I do like to kind of press them down you can use the palm of your hand I don't feel like getting all sticky so I'm just gonna use no you can just use back of a spoon try to get them flatten them all the same so there we go now I don't know whether you noticed at the beginning there's if you just bake them off like this they will look like this if you kind of if you ever gone to a bakery they seem to have these like chunks of chocolate on top so that's what I'm going to do on some of them to show you now you I'm using little chunks of chocolate but you could just use the chocolate chips as well be the same thing and just press some in I think it looks kind of cool so you could put as many or as little as you want remember they do spread out I'll do some with and some without so you can kind of see the difference so baking time you know everyone's oven as I always say is a little different and it really depends on how like how do you like your chocolate chip cookie so for me what I like what I said beginning is I like the edges nice and crisp but I like what the Centers of the cookies kind of soft and chewy so I find for this size cookie in my oven around ten minutes now you know maybe a little less some people actually like their chocolate chip cookies almost like under bakes so then you probably do a little less if you like a crisp all the way through then a little longer so you know you're gonna have to do probably one sheet to kind of experiment and see how you like yours I do like to rotate my baking sheet front to back about half way through baking time so I'm going to say about ten minutes okay our chocolate-chip cookies are done so put your baking sheet on a wire rack so this is how I like my chocolate chip cookies you can see the outside beautifully golden brown yet the inside little soft that's how I like them so what you want to do is let them cool a few minutes because they're still quite soft in the pan and then use a spatula to transfer them to a wire rack to finish cool it now I just wanted to show you this at this point of course you could make another put another pan of chocolate chip cookies in the oven or like I said you could cover your batter and put it into the refrigerator for a couple days the other choice is to freeze the unbaked cookies so what that's what I'm going to do here so what I've done is is just form all my cookies I did flatten them and then as you can see I like them with the chocolate chucks on top so I did that what I'm going to do is take this put it into the refrigerator and then just take either you know a plastic freezer bag or you get a container and they'll just pick them up put them in the bag and then put them in the freezer and then you can just bake these off frozen now they will of course take you know a couple minutes longer than if they were not frozen but this is a great way if you don't want that you can do something ahead of time which we all like so I'm just going to let these cool for minutes and then when we come back we'll try one okay so well try one there's still a little warm that's why it is nice to have the batter in the fridge or have them in the freezer because who doesn't like a freshly made chocolate chip cookie now the edges I can still they're nice and crisp when should we do chocolate-chip cookie you know why they're America's favorite cookie they are delicious the outside is wonderfully crisp using butter and then also like I said we added some baking soda which helps to make those edges really nice and crisp yep the center is still like I mean it's not under baked but it's still soft and a little chewy and I really like the kind of more bittersweet chocolate chip here because you know the batter is like I said before sweet and then I think that chocolate really counters the batter I mean the perfect cookie you you once you cover these like store them overnight I mean the cookie is going to soften so those edges won't be as crisp but they're still excellent so try these and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Joey baking calm [Music] you [Music]", "n0P-uS-BHAo": "hi guys what we're doing today is we're going to be making my very own special little red velvet and white chocolate chip cookies really simple recipe now I'm doing a cookie collaboration with some other great cooks here on YouTube and I want you to check their videos out too and at the end of the video I'm going to show you all their icons and other great cookies that they're making so that you can do a cookie swap if you want to or if you just like baking in general you can give their cookies a try if you're looking on a mobile device be sure and check the description area so that you can get all of their information and the links to their channels let's get started on this cookie we're going to get started by blending up our brown sugar or light brown sugar granulated sugar and some room temperature butter and we're just going to blend that until it's nice and fluffy next we're going to go ahead and add two whole eggs and just blend those in one at a time it's real simple recipe nothing hard about it so then we're going to add in some pure vanilla extract about two teaspoons and right after that we're going to add some red food coloring and please make sure make sure you do not get this food coloring on your cutting board on your clothes because it will stains we'll just pour it right in and go ahead and blend it on in now I'm just going to scrape my bowl down to make sure everything is well incorporated and then we're going to move on to our dry ingredients okay I'm gonna tell you guys a secret anything you see red velvet cake a cupcake a cookie it's a really good chocolate bake good that's exactly what it is only we use red food coloring to make it red now I'm just going to add some baking soda and some kosher salt to some all-purpose flour and unsweetened cocoa powder and just give that a whisk now all you have to do is add some of your dry ingredients I added about half because I didn't want flour to go everywhere and I just got that incorporated a little bit and then I added the rest of the dry ingredients this cookie is a really good cookie if you guys are doing a cookie swap or if you just like to bake in general I've had to bake this cookie recipe now several times for a friend of mine who just loves them and this recipe makes like forty to forty two cookies so you get a big batch in one whopping all the work is done okay so we're done with the hand mixer after the batter comes together you're going to stop and it's by hand from here on in okay so now what you're going to do is take lots and lots of white chocolate chips and you're just going to fold them into the dough just like that and making sure you're scraping the sides of the bowl to get any leftover dry ingredients that may be on the side that's it now I know some of you are probably thinking can I make this cookie dough ahead of time sure you can absolutely you can make this cookie dough ahead of time couple of days and then you can bake off the cookies as you need them now I'm using a standard scoop to scoop the cookies you can see it's you know small I think it's about one and a half to two tablespoons and that's how you're going to achieve forty to forty two cookies if you use a bigger scoop you're going to get less cookies so keep that in mind so in goes the first batch of 24 and we're going to put them in a preheated oven of 325 degrees and we're going to bake them off for exactly 20 minutes once they come out go ahead and let them cool and then you can eat them just as they are or enjoy them and make ice cream sandwiches out of them you know not that I know but you know go ahead and get this recipe from Gd seasoning calm thanks for joining me guys always appreciate it when you come by and spend time with me and don't forget to check out this Christmas cookie cake we also have some white

everyone and welcome back to my channel. Today I\u2019m sharing with you a recipe for\nhow to make the ultimate chocolate chip cookie. These are crunchy on the edges and soft and\ngooey in the middle. Once you\u2019ve tried these chocolate chip cookies,\nyou\u2019ll never want to make any other recipe ever again. So if you would like to learn how to make\nthese then lets get started. The first ingredient for these cookies is\nbutter. You'll need to use room temperature butter\nas we will be creaming it with sugar. Measure out the butter and add it to a medium\nsized mixing bowl. The recipe for these chocolate chip cookies\nwill be in the information box as well as a printable version on my website, so just\nclick the link of the screen now. To the butter we are going to add two types\nof sugar. Brown sugar and regular sugar. You need to use both types of sugar to get\nthe best results for your cookies as they both work in different ways. Brown sugar contains molasses so it makes\nthe cookies really gooey in the centre and adds caramel type flavour, whereas the regular\nsugar creates a crunchy edge to the cookies. Measure out the sugars and add to the same\nmixing bowl as the butter. You can use a stand mixer, or just a wooden\nspoon here to cream the butter and sugars together. If your butter is at room temperature this\nshould only take a few minutes. You want everything to be well incorporated\nand for the mixture to be quite light. Next crack in one good quality free range\negg, and add a splash of good quality vanilla extract. The vanilla really helps to round out the\nflavours and pairs really well with the chocolate. Mix the ingredients together until well combined. Measure out a cup of flour and add to the\nmixing bowl. For this recipe I am using baking soda as\nthe rising agent. From my experience with making chocolate chip\ncookies you can add baking soda, baking powder or a little of each. All three options have different outcomes. Baking soda produces more flat spread out\ncookies like the ones in for this recipe. Baking powder produces more of a puffed up\nrounded cookie, and a mixture of both produces a cookie somewhere in between. It\u2019s completely up to you what you use. Add it to the mixing bowl and mix the ingredients\ntogether until just combined. Once you can\u2019t see anymore flour it\u2019s\ntime to add some chocolate chips. I am using some dark chocolate chips here\nbut the possibilities of what you can add to these cookies are endless. Nuts, dried fruit, white chocolate. Anything goes. Add to the mixing bowl and fold the cookie\ndough together until everything is well combined. This cookie dough is now ready to be baked\nbut if you want to keep it for later you can store it in the fridge for up to three days\nor in the freezer for a few months. Roll your cookies out and place them on a\nbaking sheet topped with baking paper. To do this I am using an ice-cream scoop. It works really well at making all of the\ncookies the same size, and it\u2019s just easier than using a spoon. I\u2019ll have it linked in the information box\nif you are interested. Make sure to give the cookies some room around\nthem as they will spread as they bake. Place them into a 190d celsius or 375 f preheated\noven for about 7-10 minutes. The cookies are done when the edges start\nto brown. Remove the cookies from the oven and leave\nthem to cool on the baking tray for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack. These cookies will stay fresh in a container\nfor up to 5 days, but of course they are best eaten straight out of the oven. If you make these cookies don\u2019t forget to\nsend me a picture on my social media and let me know what you think of them. I love to see your recreations.

Bye.", "WzFSou6UHog": "hey everyone this is Angela from bake it with love and today we're making my favorite chocolate chip cookie of all times maraschino cherry chocolate chip cookies this is a remake on the website I've made them several times since starting and so this is the third version third photo third pin and this is one of our most popular pins I think each of the first two had over 25,000 which is great for us because we're a new blog so these are delicious you can cut the cherries up any size you want but I like to have nice big chunks out of my cherries in that so we're starting out with one cup or two sticks of butter that are softened at room temperature and one and a half cups of sugar we're going to beat those together until they're well combined and you want your butter and sugar to be kind of fluffy and then it will be ready to add a teaspoon of almond extract you can use vanilla if you don't have almond that works but I love the almond extract with the cherries it just really works so a teaspoon of that two large eggs and a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda we're going to beat all of these ingredients together and make sure they're combined really well before we start adding our flour and and in the meantime make sure that you have rinsed and dried your cherries your Moschino like I said cut them any size you like I do quarters with a few 1/2 and they're seeing it some nice chunks of cherry in the cookie bite these are a nice soft chewy cookie so the added cherry chunks are really really just take it over the top for soft and delicious so those are combined into our dough and then we add two and a half cups of all-purpose flour stir your flour in until it's been incorporated into all of your wet ingredients and you have a nice cookie dough texture and then we'll add the chocolate chips and then stir your chocolate chips and that's about a cup of chocolate chips and we want to stir that in because when I add the maraschino cherries we're going to gently fold it in so that we're not breaking our cherries or spreading the syrup throughout the cookie dough now the cherries I do about 3/4 cups of cherries pretty much almost all of one of those small jars of the maraschino cherries so you can see here I'm going to fold them in gently I'm trying not to break them and I'm going to eat that cookie though you could totally hold off on the chocolate chips and this is the perfect cookie dough to eat I know you're not supposed to eat it when it's raw eggs right but who doesn't eat the cookie dough will do the egg free cookie dough that you can totally guilt free eat later I promise we'll get to that make something delicious with it but holes or cherries and I'm not even too gentle there I'm just trying not to break them so and then after you refrigerate it and let your dough chill for an hour and do heaping like tablespoons teaspoons you know standard spoon that you usually eat dinner with just that's my standard spoon there and I just rolled them off into my hand roll them up into a little ball and set them so that a couple inches apart on your baking sheet I love the parchment paper because it's a really easy cleanup I'm all about easy cleanup after baking after cooking in general so the less dishes I have to do the better or the easier they are to clean in these sheets I just sanitize them after using them love it well parchment paper so do this makes about 36 cookies you're going to preheat your oven to 375 degrees remember to test a few first to see how long your other needs for those so these are the best chocolate chip cookies ever you want to try these please I hope you love the video I hope you try these out real soon if you didn't remember to give it a big thumbs up thanks so much for watching don't forget to subscribe to the channel so we have more good stuff coming and we'll see you again next time", "y4hw3veqWGk": "if you follow me you know one desire that I can never resist is a batch of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies hi guys and welcome to another episode of big rich fish our German SCV Bernardo is one of the most requested for recipe and I'm happy to be finally doing it for you guys we are making a batch of chocolate chip cookies so let's get started so may I ask Alexa Bickley of the stand mixer you cut out but please don't be intimidated guys you can use your spatula or your electric mixer whatever you have at hand I'll start with the butter so make sure is always job but I use Caray up near a civic label softened butter home and the regular salted a mole butter here that the butter should not be completely melted but both heart beating on a chair so this is the consistency that you are looking at a butter kazhagam cream currently caster sugar so a Bambaataa me darling a half cup caster sugar and half the brown sugar but if you don't have brown sugar the art was for half cup caster sugar Cassatt they place kar sakthe here a lot of you also asked me kim a corn sub brand of brown sugar you cut down so this is what I use this is faulted and line and it's a soft brown sugar you can take a closer look [Music] so this process is called dreaming of the butter and sugar it's a very important step so please don't skip it and be patient and this is only possible agar aapke butter softened hoe otherwise it will just be a crumbly mixture which you don't want now to the butter and sugar mixture I'm adding a splash of analyst on using sprig vanilla which I really really like and about a teaspoon of this now starting with the dry ingredients I have Mehta here or all-purpose flour to this I'm adding baking soda and about a tablespoon of corn flour so now the corn flour makes the cookies chewy but if you don't want to cook these to be chewy you can absolutely skip this this is optional but I like my cookies to be chewy so I'm adding this cone flower into it to give it a good mix and then we'll add it into our bed ingredients and now all you have to do is to combine the flour into your sugar and butter mixture and now the last and the final step to complete the dough is to add a binding ingredient which is the milk so about four tablespoons of this [Music] all right so the dough has come together beautifully I'll transfer it into a bowl now and then let it chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes meanwhile we can get on with chopping our chocolate which will go on top of the cookie so my dough is chilling in the refrigerator meanwhile I'll start chopping the chocolate I'm using 57% dark chocolate from this Indian brand called regal which I really really like so what i'm doing here is i'm cutting chunks of this chocolate that i can use on top of the cookies [Music] once your dough is chilled properly is when you pre-heat your oven to 180 degree Celsius I have a baking tray or lined with a silicon mat if you don't have a silicon mat you can use your parchment paper or just two layers of aluminium foil I'm using an ice cream scoop and I'll make small balls of the cookie dough on the tray now just gently press the ball with your fingers and place the chocolate chunks in block [Music] alright so the cookies are now ready for the oven I'm going to bake them at 180 degree Celsius for about 10 to 15 minutes 10 minutes kabadi I put on a yacht I probably could keep some TT baked Nahua here but remember to bake them only until the edges become golden brown once you take them out of the oven let them rest on the baking tray for another 10 minutes and they'll continue to cook now let's get these babies big creepy but let's do it so the cookies are done and now my favorite and the final touch a generous sprinkle of sea salt [Music] fun fact about me I don't share my cookies with anyone so I'm going to go now and finish this entire batch on my own you should go bake a batch for yourself get your hands on some good quality chocolate and get baking I'll be back next week with another recipe meanwhile don't forget you like this video and share this video and leave me a comment and if you haven't already please do subscribe to my channel I'd come back next week with another recipe hi guys and welcome to another episode of big picture ass recipe if you know me you know that one day the right [Music]", "9AH0GT-ollk": "[Music] hey so I'm going to show you how to make caramelized white chocolate which already sounds super exciting because caramelizing everything makes everything better including white chocolate and I love white chocolate but it can be a little bit sweet sometimes and caramelizing it is super easy and it's gonna add a whole new flavor to the white chocolate it's gonna add depth and it's going to take away a bit at that sweetness and it's going to be perfect to put in cookies or you can use it in buttercream even ice cream which is delicious and we're going to start with having some white chocolate in a bowl I've got about 250 grams of white chocolate chips here as always in baby try to use good quality chocolate this is white chocolate with a fat content of 36% if you use something with a low fat content and lower than say 30 it will work it's just going to be a bit drier in the process but it should still come out sort of the same but obviously high quality chocolate it's going to be better so what we're gonna do first is gonna put this in the microwave for about a minute and what we want to do first is just melt it as you usually would and I'm going to start with one minute on full power okay so one minute up and my white chocolate is completely melted which is perfect so now all we need to do is keep returning this chocolate to the microwave for about 15 to 20 seconds at a time stirring in between each addition of 15 20 seconds and it's going to start to caramelize it's going to start to catch it's gonna that's thickened and go grainy but just persevere keep stirring and we're gonna end up with something delicious [Music] take so well together okay so the chocolates starting to thicken it's not changing coloreds too much just yet but you can see it's really thick and what we need to do now is just keep stirring it so you can see once I started to stir it you can see how thick it was and it actually looked a bit kind of grainy and that's absolutely what we're looking for as soon as you start stirring it it's going to bring it back to a nice glossy runny liquid okay so now all we need to do is keep going 15 seconds at a time doing the exact same thing until we've got it to the color that we're looking for okay so it's been in and out once like microwaves it's for about two and a half to three minutes in total so even though it's got a heat proof Bowl it's still quite hot so I'm using my cupcake to my oven gloves which you can buy on cupcake geometers on or in our shop in Soho and you can see the color that this white chocolate has gone to it looks completely different to what it did when we started and not only does it look incredible it smells amazing so you have to try this too so you can smell it and obviously don't eat it straight away because it is really really hot so you can either let it cool down and use it liquid in butter creams or you can pour it out let it set and you can use it as chokolate chips and your cookies so Gemma's actually got an amazing double chocolate chip cookie recipe that uses caramelized white chocolate chips in it they will put that in the description box below so you can go and have a look at that recipe but I say the one thing that this isn't great for is if you want to use it for finishings and because as you may or may not know chocolate needs tempering so when you set this it might get some sort of white streaks across it like blooming and if you want to know a little bit more about tempering chocolate then maybe general let me come back and show you guys a bit about that another day and in the meantime she'll be back on Thursday with another and please make this enjoy it give it to your friends share this with your friends so they can make it too because it is incredible see ya", "SQ5RGwISgPo": "hi welcome to Lin's recipes today I'm making white chocolate chip cookie bars this is a really good recipe to take somewhere if you have a family event or you have a lot of people coming over because it makes a whole lot there are two parts to this recipe we'll do the cookie dough part first and then later on after they have cooked and cooled we'll do the cream cheese frosting part to make this cookie these are the ingredients that you will need two sticks of butter that are softened two eggs sixteen ounces of light brown sugar a teaspoon of vanilla two cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt two teaspoons of baking powder and then you'll need 12 ounces of white chocolate chips to stir into the batter after you've mixed it together you will also need a 15 and a half by ten and a half by one inch jelly roll pan that has been sprayed with cooking spray so now we're going to put all the ingredients in a mixer and mix it together we'll start with our two sticks of softened butter then we'll add our two eggs our teaspoon of vanilla our 16 ounces now I'm going to mix this part together first and then we'll add the other dry ingredients now that our butter and sugar all incorporated we're going to add our dry noodles so we'll enter 2 cups of flour Thank You powder in our salt now we'll mix again let's start off slow so the flour doesn't go all over the kitchen okay so that's all incorporated so now I'm going to use my stirrer setting on the mixer and stirring my white chocolate chips even now we have our cookie dough spread evenly in our pan we're going to place it in a 325 degree preheated oven for 25 minutes our white chocolate chip cookie bars are out of the oven and now we're going to make the cream cheese frosting to put on top the greediest that you'll need for the frosting are a stick of butter 8 ounces of cream cheese 16 ounces of confectioner's sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla I've put my cream cheese the butter in my bowl I'm going to mix them together a little bit and then I'm going to add the sugar in the vanilla so here we go confectioner sugar and continue beating you like to start out on slow so the conviction sugar doesn't fly all over the place and then as it gets mixed in okay so our frosting is all mixed together and what we're going to do now is spread it on top of our cookie bars okay so here we go we're going to put this on top of our cookie bars and spread it evenly on top I have spread my frosting evenly over the cookie bars and what I'm going to do now is put them in the refrigerator so that the frosting can get hard before we cut them into little bars and put them on a serving platter so our white chocolate chip cookie bars have been in the refrigerator so the frosting could harden and here they are I'll slice them and put them on a serving tray in here's one I hope you enjoy you", "ylxzfecackM": "Hey guys, welcome back to Basics with Babish where this week we're taking a look at the quintessential cookie - chocolate chip. We're bumping up this basic biscuit from Plain  Jane to premium. Let's get down to basics. \u266a Okay, so one of the easiest ways to upgrade your cookies instantly is to brown your butter. We've got one cup of high-quality, unsalted butter here that we're heating over a medium heat until we start to see the milk fats separate and turn a light, toasty golden-brown. You want to take it off the heat at the very second that you start seeing those milk solids turn brown. You're going to burn some butter, don't worry about it, don't beat yourself up, just, when you do get a good batch go ahead and refrigerate it for at least an hour or until completely re-solidified. We're now going to add the cold butter to the bowl of a stand-mixer. If you don't have a stand-mixer, just let the butter soften up a little bit, but ideally we want to use cold butter. To that we're going to add half a cup of plain old white sugar, and 1 and one half cups of brown sugar. You can go light or dark, depending on how molasses-ey you like your cookies. I'm going dark. From here it's kind of the regular cookie procedure, we are creaming together the butter and sugars. Getting those guys whipped together at medium speed for three to four minutes, or until thoroughly combined, and then we're going to pause to crack two cold eggs into the bowl, and mix to combine. Once we've got that all good and homogeneous, we're going to shift our attention to the drier side of things. The dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, we are whisking together about 11 and a half ounces of all purpose flour. And a solid tablespoon of kosher salt, this might seem like a lot, but hey, sweet and salty. Ever heard of it? A half teaspoon of baking soda, and then my secret little ingredient, you can feel free to omit this, but about three quarters of a teaspoon of cinnamon. I think this adds a nice, subtle warmth to all the butter and chocolate, and it doesn't really taste cinnamon-y. Give it a shot, I think you'll like it. We are whisking those together until thoroughly combined. Before adding about half of the mixture to our wet ingredients. We're doing this in batches, because just like pancakes, we don't really want to over-mix the cookie dough once we've introduced flour. Because that will result in gluten development, which will result in a tough cookie. Ha ha... ah. Once that's combined we're going to add the remaining flour mixture and your desired mix-ins. I'm just starting with high-quality chocolate chips, and adding the nuts later to half the batch for those non-nut folks out there. J. Kenji Lopez-Alt also has an awesome technique where instead of using chocolate chips, you chop up a whole block of chocolate, thereby giving you a whole bunch of different sizes and textures. Now we're going to stop mixing this guy as soon as it comes together, and, again, optionally, cover and refrigerate for up to three days. Even as little as an hour in the fridge can make a noticeable difference in texture and colour. But a few days will actually give you more pronounced flavour. Now as you can see, I've separated half the cookie dough, and toasted some freshly-chopped walnuts that I have allowed to cool, and I'm going to mix those in to the nut half of the cookie dough. Now, my last little cookie trick is inspired by Levain Bakery here in New York, Basically, you grab a handfull of your dough, roll it into a ball, and then tear it open, thus creating a whole bunch of craggly cracks and crevices, which gives you a more rustic-looking cookie. And because we used butter as opposed to shortening, and because we kept everything cold these guys are not going to lose much of their height or definition. As we bake them at 350 degrees fahrenheit, from 12-17 minutes depending on how big you've made them. Now again, this is going to come down to preference. I like my cookies sort of almost like cookie dough in the centre, I like them really raw. So these guys are going to deflate and they're going to stay chewy and gooey long into the forseeable future. I'm also going to hit them with a little bit of flaky sea salt. Now, of course, taste the cookie first to make sure you didn't oversalt it beforehand, but if it could use a little bit of an extra hit of crunchy salty flakes, go for it. Next up we've got our nutters, make sure that you're keeping everything separate and being careful to not share any cooking surfaces or cooling surfaces with the non-nut cookies, in fact, bake all the nut cookies second, if you're concerned about anyone's nut allergies. So that's how you make Grandma Babish's down home, country style brown butter chocolate chip cookies. And let me show you why we specifically engineered these to retain their height, so we keep a nice, gooey centre. Doesn't get much better than that. Now, I hope you guys try this recipe yourselves and go ahead and experiment, try using shortening instead of butter, and see how it changes the texture and final appearance of the cookie. Try chilled versus un-chilled ingredients, try aging cookie dough versus un-aged cookie dough, after all, can you really have too many cookies? I mean, yeah, of course you can. So... enjoy responsibly. And bring a plate over to your neighbours'. Who knows, maybe you guys will start dating, and maybe that's how you meet your future spouse. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're welcome, and I'll see you at the bachelor party.", "ONjRr1-mjfY": "- Today I'm gonna show you how to make a chocolate lover's dream, chocolate chocolate chip\ncookies with toasted pecans and a little something extra that I'm not gonna tell\nyou about til later. If you like my videos, hit\nthat like button and subscribe. Okay, let's get started. I'm adding two cups or 240\ngrams of all purpose flour into a small bowl. Just gonna weigh it out. Perfect. Now, two thirds of a cup of cocoa powder. I was gonna sift that out. Nevermind, it's okay. All right, half a teaspoon of salt. Three quarters of a\nteaspoon of baking powder. Ahem, I said. Now let's whisk it together. Carefully since I used\na bowl that's too small. (laughs) So chocolatey, so chocolatey. This is a chocolate lover's cookie. Okay, set that aside, including the scale. Now we're gonna cream our butter together. Into my stand mixer, I'm adding one cup or 226 grams of unsalted\nbutter at room temperature. In you go. No. (laughs) Look at me, trying to be a big shot. Okay, in you go, thank you. Close it up, cream it up. (beep) Plug it in, then cream it up. (beep) Cream that butter. Just cream it right up. Now we can add in one\nand a half cups of sugar. One. Two. This guy has to get polished. Let it beat until it's\nnice and light and fluffy. You will notice a difference. (upbeat instrumental music) Okay, I think you can tell, nice, creamy, fluffy, light. I'm gonna add two eggs in one at a time. And this recipe, if\nyou're making it at home, calls for two teaspoons\nof vanilla extract, but I have been baking all day, (laughs) I spilled my vanilla extract. There is enough left for this recipe, but instead I'm gonna use two teaspoons of orange blossom water because I think that orange, chocolate, great combination, I wanna give it a try. Always be adventurous in baking. If it makes sense. All right, one egg. Two eggs. Got it in. Now for the orange blossom water. This is so fragrant. I highly recommend it. Smells so good. Okay that is fluffed up to heck and back. I'm just going to, oh it's so cloudy on the inside. All this butter is so lightweight because all the air that got whipped in. Now it is time for that dry mixture. So we're gonna add this in\nwhile it's mixing on low. Stay in. Okay. Saved it. Kind of. Okay, here we go. This, yes. I really like the orange\nblossom water in here. You could leave it out if you want. And if you wanna go crazy,\ngrate some orange zest in here. Zest of an orange. You will be in orange chocolate heaven. Right now I'm adding a generous half cup of chopped\ntoasted pecans, my favorite. You could also use walnuts. You could also omit the nuts all together. Macadamia nuts, that's an option too. One cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. The never ending cup. And two cups of semi\nsweet chocolate chips. Get those all in there. Again, if you want them\nto be super chocolatey, use the full two cups. If you want more of the\ncookie, cut it in half. We're just gonna mix this up by hand. I wanna remind you to use a metal spatula when you do this because it\nwill snap the wooden ones. I've learned the hard way. (upbeat instrumental music) Get your exercise in there. I mean, unfortunately with food blogging and then the twins, this\nis all the exercise I get. Gone, gone are the Los Angeles\nfancy exercise classes. That's a memory. (sighs) Memories. All right, that's pretty good. Oh, this is cookie dough. This is delicious stuff. I'm not gonna eat it though. It's gonna onto a baking sheet and I will be using a Silpat. I'm using my trusty one and a half tablespoon ice cream scoop to get some nice consistent cookies. You could use whatever you'd like though. This is also the neatest way for me 'cause other wise my hands would be completely covered in cookie\nbatter, cookie dough, yeah. All right, on you go. (upbeat instrumental music) So full of chocolate and nuts. The nice thing about making\nyour own cookie dough too is that you can make a batch, put the rest in the fridge or the freezer, just make sure it's really well sealed, and have on demand fresh homemade cookies whenever you'd like. (upbeat instrumental music) These cookies are ready\nto go into the oven. However, let me show you a little, I don't know if it's a food blogger trick or just like a persnickety person trick, but if you want them to look\na little bit more perfect, just put a couple chocolate chips on top. You can imbed them in so it looks like it happened naturally. And that way when they bake, you'll have that nice\nglossy chocolate chip top and a little bit more chocolate. You can do the same\nthings for the pecans too. Just a couple little pieces\nof pecan here and there poking out, not covered\nby the cookie dough. They'll look really nice and show everyone exactly what's inside, besides butter and sugar. These'll bake at 350 Fahrenheit for about eight to 10 minutes. Just watch them spread. The edges will set. The inside'll be kinda gooey still, so let them set by cooling Don't lift them up. Out of the oven, just\ncool enough to handle and they smell so good. I didn't even eat any off camera. I waited for you. Okay, I'm gonna choose one of the cookies, put the rest away for later, and let's take a look inside. This is like chocolate fudge basically. You know I like a burnt\ncookie but for these guys, I don't mind them being\nlike so cakey and fudgey. (laughs) That's really good. There's so much chocolate in there. And the orange comes through in the last two thirds of the bite. Oh, that orange is nice. In fact, if you make this\nwith the orange blossom water, add some orange zest in too. You will be in chocolate orange heaven. Okay, thanks so much for watching. Hit that like button.

I've written articles about this cookie I dream about this cookie I've woken myself up because I and I start biting the air really embarrassing but that's that's a sign that I'm hungry and I'm probably dreaming about something really delicious so yeah this is the ultimate chocolate-chip cookie it will ruin you for all other cookies every time I make this for any friends it becomes their go-to cookie this is legitimately my favorite cookie on this earth it has all of my favorite flavors it's got brown butter dark brown sugar toffee dark chocolate the chocolate never seems to actually harden up it's just in this perennial state of goo which I love I cannot wait to eat this cookie so let's get started so this cookie is a little bit different than most this one we're actually starting with brown butter this does a couple of things the first thing is it adds incredible flavor because we're browning the the butter and we're not whipping it it's going to lay a little bit flatter it's the edges of the cookie you're gonna crisp up you're gonna get a nice lacy hard texture on the outside of the cookie but the inside is gonna stay really moist and and the chocolates just gonna get really gooey alright so the first thing I'm going to do is turn on this pan I'm gonna drop two sticks of unsalted butter in there you just want to basically swirl that'll help get the butter to melt more quickly so the thing about the brown butter is it happens really quickly so you can see the outside edges of the pan the butter is already starting to brown and stick to the sides as soon as you see it get slightly golden go ahead and transfer it to a heatproof bullet and you watch it's going to continue to brown even as it sits and uh it smells so good so this is super hot I'm gonna scrape it into my stand mixer it needs to cool down if I put my raw eggs in this right now you're gonna get brown butter scrambled eggs and that might sound good but it's really not so I'm gonna let that sit and cool and I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients salt definitely important for baked goods by using baking soda you're gonna promote some both the spread of the cookie but also the other brownie I'm gonna give this a little whisk this step is really important because you want to make sure that you've thoroughly incorporated all of the dry ingredients together and now toffee I actually prefer having the toffee in the the cookie so I'm going to refrain from starting to eat this I'm gonna mix the sugars into the butter the butter is still pretty hot but it's not gonna matter for the sugar nothing's gonna happen other than the it's gonna cool down a little bit more and all we're really doing here is we're just mixing to combine and to also pull it off it smells so good this is 72% cacao chocolate wafers wafers tend to melt more evenly and smoothly than chips do I also find that whenever you buy wafers they didn't to be better quality chocolate than your average chip so I've got the Sun low I'm gonna add the vanilla I'm adding to room temp eggs all right I'm gonna increase to medium it's turning color it's a little bit lighter it takes between about 30 seconds and a minute to get this consistency you really want to get this sort of light and creamy texture otherwise your cookies just gonna spread and you're gonna get these like really thin cookies now we are going to add the dry I'm gonna pulse this to make sure that I don't splatter flour everywhere almost looks like it's come together chocolate so I'm gonna go ahead and just pulse it again just to mix and now take this out now I'm going to make sure you get all of these little shavings as well because those are gonna melt in and just add a lot more flavor just really get in there scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl this dough is gonna seem really loose and that's fine because of the brown butter you really need to let this sit for at least 30 minutes all right that looks really good I want to stick my finger in there and eat it it was so bad and I think I'm going to quality control I'm gonna leave that put it out of arms reach and let it sit for 30 minutes to harden up and then we'll make cookies so the dough is rested and by the way can I just say that every single member of this crew got a spoon and eat cookie dough too so it wasn't just me so this dough has been resting so you can see it comes together this is what you're looking for they should be firm dough balls when you put them on the sheet tray otherwise they're just gonna spread and you're not gonna get the texture that you should get this cookie I typically use an ice cream scoop when I do cookies this shape is perfect for forgetting like beautiful cookies I usually do nine just to get an idea of how much they're gonna spread and then all the subsequent trays I will then add either more or keep it the same depending on the spread there is salt in the cookie dough I deliberately did not put a lot of salt if I was going to not top it with flaky sea salt I would have upped the salt in the dough I really love the hit of salt on the top visually it looks pretty but the other thing that it does it gives you one more added bit of crunch on the outside crisps Morocco actually was around when I was developing and testing this recipe and he and I would literally just take a sheet tray fill it up with the the cookie balls and stick it in the freezer and in case of emergency we would just pull out like four or five balls of cookie dough throw them in the oven you've got fresh hot cookies just salt them right before they go in the oven don't put the salt on top and then freeze them because it'll melt and you'll just get a really salty weird edge all right so I'm going to throw these in a hot oven you want this 375 so if you really wanted to do two sheets at a time go for it the reason why I did it is because there are certain cookies that benefit from being in the center of the oven so it's getting the optimal heating from the bottom and from the top yes look at that so beautiful as much as I want to tear into these they're super hot if I try to pull them off the pan they would just sort of disintegrate and melt so I'm going to leave them on the tray to crisp up the bottom a little bit for about ten minutes if you try and pull these off before ten minutes they're just going to be way too soft and especially if you're using the wafer chocolate they'll just sort of disintegrate and chocolate will go everywhere all right so these are gonna sit for another 15 minutes or so I might cut into one you in flow one now okay yeah that's fine well that's pretty intense alright as much as I want to eat these all to myself I'm gonna invite Alex and so come on Billy any let's uh you've had these before I have an ear con man because you run the risk of me eating all of yours well really I want you to pull me a shot of espresso okay so we're trading we're trading one yeah yeah I remember good told the brown-butter member in the toffee in assault whoa dude thank you like I'm making my afternoon right now any time you know there anytime and you I'm holding you to that tomorrow I'm gonna be like Rick where's the cookies I mean you know I'll make more still waiting for my coffee but um just gonna keep eating cookies cuz they're really good I'm actually really upset because I don't have

combined then stir in the 1/3 of a cup of white chocolate chips you could always use regular chocolate chips for this but the white chocolate adds a really nice contrast to the red color of the cookies using a cookie scoop or a table spoon scoop out a portion of the dough roll it between your hands until you get a ball shape and put it on a cookie sheet a greased cookie sheet or one covered with parchment paper or a silicone mat roll the balls and don't squish them when you put them on the cookie sheet they don't have to be squished then carefully press in a few white chocolate chips on the surface of the cookie it's important when you're putting on the white chocolate chips if you don't squish those cookie dough balls flat you want to make sure they stay a nice round shape because they do spread a lot when they're baking and if they start up nice and high and round they won't spread quite as much if you do happen to flatten a little bit just bring them back into a ball shape before you bake them 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about eight to ten minutes until they are a little bit cracked on the top and they are set take them out of the oven let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before you remove them on to cooling racks and you'll see I didn't leave enough space between the cookies because they are touching a little bit there are the completed cookies if you've never had a red velvet cookie before they do have a mild chocolate flavor to them the white chocolate chips goes very well with that and it's a also a nice flavor in these cookies the cookies themselves are lightly crispy with a chewy Center and those white chocolate chips are a really nice contrast to that bright red color so red velvet white chocolate chip cookies give them a try", "kGHHmIXIP4M": "hi guys welcome back to CJ's Kito kitchen while the temperatures have definitely dropped and it's a wonderful time of year to begin our seasonal baking so tonight I'm going to be making very traditional cookie and it's going to be white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies so come along with me so white chocolate is a traditional mixed with macadamia nuts in cookie form you can buy the giant containers of them at Costco and places like that and sometimes it can be something that people on this lifestyle tend to miss but I have worked very hard to try and change this recipe into a low-carb option and still make it something that you can make with not a lot of difficulty but it does have some essential steps and I'm going to be going over those essential steps while I'm making the recipe and it will also be on our blog to assist you in how I feel that this recipe has been perfected so well with that information let's go ahead and get started baking some cookies to start our cookies we need to do a couple of things first so one of them being we need to preheat our oven to 350 degrees we are also going to need a cookie sheet I am using a silicone mat on mine we have some linked in our Amazon favorites I really do love the silicone mat if you do not have a silicone mat I would suggest using parchment paper also going to need a medium size Bowl because we are going to be starting with our wet ingredients to make our cookies we are going to cream our butter and our alternative sweetener so the other important first steps that you're going to need to pre do I have a room-temperature egg here that I have left for several hours if you decide that you're going to make cookies at the last minute you can put an egg in a cup of warm water for about 10 minutes and it should bring it to room temperature I also have room-temperature butter so it's quite soft I have just let it sit out for several hours in a warm room and it's very important to have softened butter in this step and also a room-temperature egg I'm going to put our softened butter in the bottom of our medium-sized bowl and we are going to need a half a cup which is one stick of butter that we are going to add sooo Crenn gold brown sugar alternative and we're going to need a half a cup of this swerve also makes a brown sugar alternative that you can usually find on the grocery store shelf but I do really like the super in gold brand we're just going to firmly pack our brown sugar into our measuring cup and once again that is 1/2 a cup we are also going to put in about a teaspoon of vanilla extract you can add a little more if you like vanilla which I do and we are going to beat the softened butter and our brown sugar alternative before we add our egg [Applause] and you can see how nicely everything creams together when your butter is nicely softened now we're going to add our room-temperature egg and we are going to beat that in [Applause] okay everything is nicely incorporated with our wet ingredients we're going to set this aside and begin assembling our dry ingredients in a separate Bowl so you don't need a super large bowl but I have a smallish bowl and I also have my sister and I'm going to put everything into the sifter and then sift it all together and that ensures that our dry ingredients are well combined first thing that we are going to need is one cup of almond flour the next thing we are going to need is a quarter of a cup of coconut flour our next step is two tablespoons of whey protein powder I just have the unflavored kind but vanilla would also work well in this step whey protein powder is very easy to find even on grocery store shelves I double-checked my local Walmart and another Walmart in my area and both of them carry protein powder just on the shelves usually in the pharmacy areas where you find the supplement type things of course you can order it or you can go to a you know a Whole Foods or a you know vitamin World or whatever you have but a lot of people practicing the ketogenic lifestyle will sometimes make shakes and that kind of thing so you might even have it on hand I tried very hard for this recipe I have done it multiple times trying to find out what is the best binder for this I tried xanthan gum and I didn't feel like it gave as much body and thickness to our cookies as using a whey protein powder in this step so I definitely recommend the whey protein powder and I really cannot think of an alternative that works as well as this oh this bag needs to be used by the end of the year because we have had this bag of protein powder for probably at least a year so it it is not cost prohibitive when you think of the amount that you're going to use especially if you don't make protein shakes on the regular I have used whey protein and several of my recipes including my bagel dogs and my bagels because there's something about the body of the whey protein that helps with the thickness and the stretch of baked goods so it's it's definitely something that's nice to have around and it's going to last you for a while especially if you don't make protein shakes on a regular basis also in addition to that this has zero carbohydrates in it so definitely you know check your macros this one happens to be an unflavored product but it does have zero total carbs in this so it is a really good choice and I can link this one I do believe we got this one on Amazon but you can find whey protein powder products just locally in your town so our next step is going to be 2 teaspoons of baking powder we're also going to add just a little bit of salt of course we had salted butter but I still like adding just about a half a teaspoon of salt now we are going to sift our dry ingredients together and by doing this you are ensuring that your leavening agent which is the baking powder gets fully incorporated into our almond flour so that you don't end up with clumps of Lebanese because that can be quite distasteful if you ended up with a clump of livening in one of your cookie bites that wouldn't be very good so by sifting them you are not only getting your almond flour as fine as possible but you are also incorporating your ingredients evenly to make it for an evenly tasted cookie and I like when I sift to go both one direction and then back up and go the other direction that can sometimes help the rest of your things break up and then you'll see in the bottom of my sifter I ended up with some big clumps so then that makes sure that that didn't go into our our cookies okay so I am going to be again slowly incorporating you can see our butter is nice in there so I'm going to put half of this in there mix and then do the other half [Applause] [Applause] okay so there is our batter now we need of course the stars of the show and that is going to be our white chocolate and our macadamia nuts so I have five ounces of macadamia nuts here that I have roughly chopped because we do want some smaller pieces but also some larger chunks so that when you bite into the cookie you know that you are having a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie then the other thing I am putting in is four ounces of white chocolate chip these are sugar free product these are baked believe I love a good pun that is so funny and these are stevia-sweetened baking chips and I have found mine at Walmart and they are half the price of Lilly's chips in fact I don't think Lilly's makes a white chocolate chip at this juncture to my knowledge but the macros on here are very good it's 10 total carbs with a three dietary fiber and then seven-year throat also it's essentially zero Nick arms for these so in my research I have discovered that even baking with your regular full fully sugar loaded white chocolate chip they are very finicky product and part of that is because even though they are called white chocolate chips white chocolate does not actually have any cocoa in it so it is not really chocolate it is a cocoa butter product and it is sweetened either with sugar in this case stevia and some waxes and some vanilla --nz so the very nature of white chocolate is very delicate and finicky it tends to break down a lot quicker because it does not have that cocoa to give it the heft to stay whole so white chocolate is a lot more delicate and it can be a little bit more difficult to work with so I have uncovered several things that will help us in this particular cookie recipe but it's not just because this is a low carb product it is simply the nature of white chocolate chips in general so I'm going to put these in just by hand with a spoon we're not going to use our mixer anymore and I'm going to try and fully incorporate this so we have chocolate chips and macadamia nuts and most of our cookie batter so when we go to scoop it out later we get an even product now my next tip so remember our first essential tip was room-temperature butter and room-temperature egg my second essential tip that cannot be ignored and I would not attempt these cookies without this step is you must chill this dough this dough requires chilling not only for the butter and structure of the white chocolate chips to hold together but it also increases the thickness of your cookie so when we put our cookie on the cookie sheet because it has been chilled it gives the right amount of timing between putting it on the sheet and baking it in the oven for the cookie to maintain its shape if you do not chill it the tendency is for white chocolate chips to spread and that will come in to play later on in my third essential step for this recipe but the one that you need to remember at this juncture is we are going to stir this and incorporate it and then I'm going to put this into the refrigerator to chill for a minimum of a half hour you could actually chill this overnight and it would be even better [Applause] [Applause] okay there is our finished dough and I'm going to put this into my refrigerator for a half-hour and then we will be back to put these on our cookie sheet and all of the information that I am talking about with the essential steps will be part of our blog post along with the recipe so that you will be able to go back and refer to the steps just to make sure that you're comfortable with this dough so I have let my cookie dough chill for an hour so it's nice and chilled and as soon as I scoop out cookies for this tray I will put this dough back in the refrigerator another important suggestion is if you're going to be making the entire batch of cookies at one time use two cookie sheets I have two cookie sheets it's a good investment that way you're always putting chilled cookie dough onto a room-temperature cookie sheet and that way the residual heat of the cookie sheet that you just took out will not affect the product that you are now placing on it that is cold another essential step to me is having a cookie baller this cost me less than five dollars at Walmart it's the perfect size and it will come out round it and I will show you why this is a very essential step so my cookie dough is nice and firm I am going to put it on my cookie sheet I want the cookie to have a round shape when I put it on the cookie sheet that is one of the tips that will be in the recipe and on the blog because we are going to allow these cookies to cook for eight minutes then I will pull the cookies out of the oven just the rack and I will press down and then they will cook for two more minutes leaving them in this round shape ensures the end product does not spread out and make a thin flat kay cookie but we'll keep its nice thick denseness that we want for a cookie so I'm going to go ahead and put my full amount of cookies on my sheet I am going to have 12 on here at once my cookie dough is nice and firm I'm really having to work hard to get it out and that is what you're looking for the consistency that you're looking for because it's going to allow the cookie to cook in the oven without melting down the butter and the chocolate chips too quickly using a cookie baller for this step is also nice because it ensures that your cookies are relatively the same size which helps promote an even cooking okay so there are our even sized cookie balls and remember they are in a ball shape and we want to leave them in this ball shape for eight minutes so I'm putting them in the oven for eight minutes at 350 degrees [Music] okay so the cookies have been in for eight minutes and they are starting to get brown I don't know if you can see that or not at this point I'm just going to use my hand and gently push just a little bit on each cookie just a gentle push just to slightly flatten them not all the way now I am going to put them back into the oven for two more minutes when I remove the cookies from the oven the cookie sheet is hot which means that your cookies will continue to cook a little bit once they're removed from the oven it's like ordering a medium-rare steak by the time you go to eat it it will be medium because it will continue cooking on your plate for a little while so always better have something underdone and let it continue to residually cook okay I am removing them now from the oven you can see they are lightly browned but I'm going to have CJ come in there really tight so that I can show you what happens you come in here really tight see this pool of white chocolate if you cook your cookies too long your white chocolate will liquefy and we do not want that so I'm going to remove these from my hot cooking surface and put them on the counter so my third essential step with these cookies you'll see they that you might think that they look underdone really they're not like I said they're going to continue to cook also you'll see when you do removed them that the bottoms are Brown that is what we want you cannot remove these cookies sorry you cannot remove these cookies from the cookie sheet not right now even when you think that they are slightly cool do not take these cookies off your cookie sheet and put them on to a cooling rack because which is what I always do for say a chocolate chip cookie do not do that with the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies these cookies have to remain on the cookie sheet until they are completely cooled to room temperature if you try to remove these when they are still warm they will crumble I did not do that with my cooled ones they are completely solid and they have stayed in a solid state I actually took a container to my mother's house and I dropped it on the porch on the way out to the car and they still stayed together so you have to let them remain on the cookie sheet and that is why I said you need a second cookie sheet if you're going to make your batch of cookies all in one go around hi CJ hi it's time for cookies no I see you know I like to make fancy desserts but sometimes just a good ol classic recipe is what we need yeah so these are white chocolate macadamia nut cookies and of course they are key to look I know you you made these before I had the first batch well this was not my first batch accessible batch you can see the macadamia nuts pretty big chunk right in there yeah and the white chocolate something good it's a nice little treat yeah Trey doesn't become a couple call me yes yeah yeah did a lot of flavor I didn't know what they were I wouldn't know that they were well that they weren't no I didn't know what they were I wouldn't know that they were named different than they were sugar-free any other macadamia nut cookie sorry good good they're not all really sweet you know but what they do provide that sweet salty because yeah I mean they're saltiness of the macadamia yeah they do so and the chips give the sweetness too but in there was no cookies not overly the dough was not obviously yes so it's good I could be thank you I

guess who's back it's me and I'm back here at condos HQ after a lot of rest and I am so much better my back is recovering so need to take it easy so I'm still not in the bakery I'm doing all the sitting down work but the gang slowly included have been and doing an amazing job of keeping you guys recipe DUP now with keeping me in in you know after my eyeballs and cookies but the best cookie that was I've ever had was the New York style cookies that reason I've made so delicious and if you haven't made that yet please check it out but not yet the cause I am setting your Italian okay I love that cookie it was amazing it was amazing I think it could go like 10 million times more intense okay I want a really chocolatey double chocolate the chocolate cookie so ultimately cookie okay so like think that other cookie the New York chocolatey boy it more got it okay and I want it warm well not straight from the oven I got that burn my mouth but I I want it as it as you guys have been having while I've girl she's so demanding but like come on joy is abuzz and it is Christmas and I've got my apron and the Crocs and she's gone so let's head into the bakery and we will come up with hopefully the most chocolate eeriest yummiest cookie for cupcake Gemma cos she deserves it and she's eating for two remember okay cupcake Gemma challenge accepted I'm gonna make you the most chocolaty version of that New York cookie that Dana and I came up with a few weeks ago unfortunately Dana's a busy guy he's over in Soho running our bakery there so it's just me today but I've been chatting with him and the other guys here Nikki Rosie and we think we've come up with the perfect recipe the little tape on the one we did before but it's not just as simple as chucking in cocoa and chocolate and I'll explain a bit more about that as we go on but we're gonna start with 230 grams of cold butter which is chopped up it's really important that it is cold straight from the fridge that's going to go in our mixer and we're gonna get that beating just for about one minute and that's just gonna gently break up our butter we don't want to cream it or anything it's too hard for that anyway we just want to break it up so now we can add some sugar and we've quite equal quantities 160 grams of both caster sugar and light brown soft sugar we'll pour both of those in and get the mixer going for another 30 seconds just to combine them with the butter and you can see it's not combined like as if you were creaming it together it's made little nuggets and that's absolutely perfect do not worry now we're going to go in with some chocolate we've got 450 grams here I'm going for a 54% chocolate because I sometimes find 70% is too intense and but by all means put whatever chocolate you like in your milk and then back on for again another 30 seconds just to kind of mix it through again not beating it not creaming it just combining it [Music] and now it's time for our dry ingredients and we're gonna start with the flour so we have got 230 grams of self-raising flour and 200 grams of plain flour now this is a little bit less than we had in the kind of regular chocolate chip cookie that's because we're going to add some cocoa and if we just added the cocoa on top of the full quantity of flour it's very to dry so we've kind of removed a little bit of self-raising flour - and replace with 70 grams of cocoa powder we're going to put all of that into the mix [Music] and then to give these cookies the lift that we want because we want big fat cookies we're going to go in with one full tablespoon of baking powder which bit of baking trivia for you is the same as three teaspoons a quarter teaspoon of bicarb and a full teaspoon of salt now so it's really important because it pulls out flavor and it just enhances everything so don't you know I know a lot of people don't really like pudding so and stuff but it's really beneficial and you'll get much more flavor from your cooking so we're going to put on a slow-speed and just let it sort of combine and it's going to go to a bread crumb consistency and that is exactly how we want it [Music] ok so now it's time to bind this all together and we're going to do that with our wonderful eggs I've got two large eggs but if we close the cocoa powder it does make this mixture a little bit drier we're going to add an extra egg yolk [Music] and I'm just mixing those up a little bit just because with this batter in general we don't want to over beat it so I'm just helping the eggs by mixing them together first put the mixer on slow and we're just going to pour in our egg and bind it all together and once your mixture has come together it won't take more than a minute or two we can start measuring our cookies and we're gonna go for 125 gram balls because we found that that is our preferred cookie maybe you like them bigger go for it so measure out 125 grams gently squish them together I'm not rolling them and then put them onto a board and keep going [Music] so it actually managed to get 13 rather than 12 I thought I was gonna get it 12 but what a full baker's dozen I'm not entirely sure why 13 is baker's dozen anyway we're gonna wrap these in cling film because we need to freeze these for 90 minutes or overnight and because we want them to fake so they're all kind of gooey and the inside and freezing them is going to help with that it's gonna stop them from spreading as well so I'm gonna pop these in for 90 minutes now luckily I've already made some cookie dough because I don't want to wait 90 minutes for these to chill and I've already got my oven set to 180 degrees C with a fan and also I've got in there a baking tray getting nice and hot because that's going to make the underneath of our cookies nice and crispy [Music] okay so we need to space our cookies out enough that they're not going to stick together because they are going to spread a little bit but I think we can probably get about 9 or 10 on here at once we've got a lot of hungry people in this kitchen today and I know they all want a cookie so we're gonna bake these for 18 minutes and they crack the outsides really nice and crispy and the inside sorry all squishy and gooey [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my goodness they look amazing no oh hi there - hi - I know look at them mmm they're really squishy but they are far too hot to be eating right now or so we need to let them cool down a bit so they kind of stick together if you try to pick this up now it's gonna crumble so shoot ten minutes burn your fan they will burn your face oh really good I made the bail amazing do don't they and then they do cool down a bit but they're still soft and melty yeah them the chocolate chips should be melted still let's have a look inside oh my god there you go let's do it okay with that drop the tea enough for you I mean yeah good right thank you we're also gonna have these in the solar stalks along with the chocolate chip version that Dana and I did so if you're in the area please go and check it out get cakes get cookies get coffee put your feet up while she doing your sales shopping and everything yeah yeah that's fine that's fine but um yeah thank you so much for watching and I'll just keep talking we'll be back in the new year with loads more recipes it's been a super fun really busy 2019 with weddings and babies and New York ish trips for some for me and Sam we had a great time and yeah we'll be back in the New Year yeah thanks so much for watching and thank you all so much for your support with my injury and my new thing that's happening in here I've got exciting things happening in the in 2020 believe it 2020 I know weird we're gonna have mini cupcake Gemma upon us in no time little mini cupcake I hope the nice cupcakes well I hope it likes cookies because they're basically mostly made of cooking mouths so anyway we'll see you next year bye guys [Music]", "YEZPxhMneOc": "- Hi everyone, it's Natasha\nof NatashasKitchen.com and today we are making our\nfavorite chocolate chip cookies. These are big, soft, and loaded with melt-y morsels of chocolate. These cookies stay soft for days. In a large mixing bowl,\ncombine two sticks, or one cup, of softened, unsalted butter with one cup of light brown sugar and half a cup of granulated sugar. Cream those together on\nmedium-high speed until smooth. (cheerful EDM music) You'll need two room temperature eggs. Add them one at a time, beating\nwell with each addition. Now mix in two teaspoons\nof vanilla extract. In a separate small mixing bowl, combine three cups of all-purpose flour, two teaspoons of baking powder, and a half a teaspoon of salt. Whisk that together, then add it to the creamed mixture in thirds. Adding it in thirds makes\nit much easier to blend. For the cookies to rise properly, make sure to measure your flour correctly by spooning it into the measuring cup and scraping off the top. And last but not least, add two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and fold those into the batter\njust until well combined. This cookie dough is\nthe perfect consistency. Now you can roll your\ncookie dough balls by hand, but I find it easier to use a trigger-release ice cream scoop. The cookies all end up the same size and they bake up more evenly. I also like to stud the\ntops of the cookie balls with a few extra chocolate\nchips for a prettier cookie. This recipe makes 21 large cookies. Arrange them on two\nparchment lined cookie sheets and bake one sheet at a time. You can freeze or refrigerate the second batch for another day and I will leave instructions\nfor that in the recipe post. Bake in the center of a pre-heated oven at 350\u02daF\nfor about 13 to 15 minutes or until the edges are\njust turning golden. The tops should still\nlook a little under baked when you pull them out of the oven. (chuckles) Cookies are ready. Okay and you wanna let these\nrest on the baking sheet for about five minutes once\nthey come out of the oven because they're super soft and they'll be hard to transfer. You don't want them to break unless it's in your mouth. (giggling) Okay. Goofy jokes aside, I'm\nready for this taste test. Okay, so transfer those to a baking rack and let them cook a little bit but I like to eat them\nwhile they're still warm and that chocolate is melt-y and gooey. Ooh! (giggling) Okay, so we're gonna jump\nright into this taste test. Got my milk here. You definitely want to be ready with that. Okay, here we go. Let's pick a big fluffy one. That's pretty much all of them. (giggling) Okay, this one looks promising. And take a look inside. Look at this. It is so soft. These are fully baked but you still have the amazing cookie dough consistency inside and they are so, so chocolate-y. (giggling) Yum! Wow, okay, here we go. Here we go, here we go. Mm. Mm, mm, mm. Mm. This just made my day. (laughing) And a little swig of milk. Perfect. (giggling) These have the perfect balance\nof sweetness and chocolate. They're wonderful and so moist and gooey and soft and fluffy and tall. Look at this. Mm. (giggling) My kids go wild for these. I haven't told them that\nthese are out of the oven yet because they're just gonna fly right off of this cutting board. So good and I love that you\ndon't have to wait for these. There's no resting. There's no refrigerating, although you can if you want to. I like to make half the batch now and leave the other half of the batch for tomorrow or the next day. So good. I hope this becomes a new\nfavorite recipe for you. Try it and you'll probably never look for another chocolate\nchip cookie recipe again.

fridge for about 30 minutes now that your dough has chilled pre-heat your oven to 175 degrees Celsius you're going to take about a tablespoon of your dough and just roll it and kind of flatten it and you're going to place it on a baking sheet with parchment paper and make sure that your cookies are about six centimeters apart so that they can spread out in the oven I actually d flattened my cooking because I like them to spread and be a little chunkier these will have to bake in your oven for 10 to 12 minutes until you see them nice and spread just cookie licious as our cookies are a cooling we're now going to make the frosting so in a bowl you're going to place your cream cheese you can do this in your kitchen robot if you like your make sure your pink cream cheese is at room

your powdered sugar and you want to mix on medium low speed until nice and creamy now we're ready to frost our cookies I have also melted in the microwave the 22 grams of white chocolate and chopped my cranberries so you want to take a cookie and with the spatula take some frosting you don't exceed too much and you want to cover the top of your cookie [Music] and then you want to take the chopped cranberries and put them over the top as you like read them out and then using a little fork you're going to take some of the white chocolate and just drizzle that over the top like this and then you're going to let this set at room temperature and then you can store these in the fridge so here they are our super cute adorable festive cranberry cookies and they look so good and colorful and

want to see more and you can check out my most recent video and video children just for you over here I hope you all have a great new year's and christmas and i'll see you next time bye [Music] you", "P1gqm9CG8sw": "it's our last day here in New York and Gemma has sent me back uptown to levan bakery to get her one last cookie before we go home and it's such a shame that you can only get these in New York because they are absolutely amazing so I thought that maybe when we get back to London we could get the CNT gang together put our heads together and kind of come up with our take on the levant cookie welcome back to France and doilies now Gemma is still off I'm afraid she's at home resting up thank you for all your messages they're really cheering her up and hopefully she'll be back with you guys soon but Dana and I are here on our day off at the bakery because we are both craving those levan style cookies from New York and so we have been here all morning experimenting with all different types of recipes to come up with what we think is the best replica and we're going to share that with you but why don't you come over here and see what we've been up to you this morning now like I said we have been up for hours coming up with hopefully what we've perfected the levan style cooking we're looking for a really chewy soft Center and the chocolate chips that kind of melted inside a little bit half-baked and that is exactly how the cookies work from the back yeah and my favorite bit was that the outside was still kind of crispy but then the inside was like doing so kind of half-baked and gooey and delicious it's not been as easy as we thought like all kinda principally I mean if we look at this one for example this looks just like you I mean it's so delicious video it's huge that's not what they look like in New York I mean if we break it open you can see it's just kind of I mean it's just too thin yeah so that one is out the window I'm afraid and then your this one here as one is kind of the shape that we want so it's nice and thick and that when we break it open it's really so the chocolate chips are kind of melted but when you eat it the texture is a little bit cakey and it's not that kind of half-baked gooeyness so we've kind of come up with this one was the closest we got to it and it's nice and light in color it's gooey on the inside it's got a nice crispy shell and there's a few tweaks we've made to it and now we think we've got it so why don't you come with us and we're gonna show you our recipe so first I'm going to talk to you about our kind of additions and we're gonna do the walnut and milk chocolate version of the cookie we've found that walnuts have a really strong bitter taste and actually when we were eating the levan cookies you couldn't really taste the walnuts it with more adding a buttery crunchy texture to it so we need to get the skins off these walnut and that can be really kind of Fafi because they're kind of funny shapes and the skins all over them and it takes a long time to do it by hand so what I've done is I've popped a whole tray of walnuts in the oven for about five minutes and I'm now gonna put them into a tea towel and rub off the skin so what I'm doing is just kind of rubbing the nuts between each other and the tea towel and that is just gonna help pull off the skin as you can see when we open it now this nut has got completely skin which is exactly how we want it so we're gonna use 100 grams of these nice skinned walnuts along with 400 grams of the milk chocolate you can use whatever chocolate you like but because it's a lot of chocolate dark taupe it can be pretty overpowering at the best of times and 400 grams of it is going to be like intense so that's why we're going for 400 grams of milk chocolate okay so now it's time to start making our cookie dough yeah so we've got 250 grams of cold butter and it's really important especially that the butter is super cold and affect the overall texture at the end okay let's go inside and then we're just gonna yeah put this on the mixer and we're just gonna break it up a little bit so maybe like 30 seconds who's like then said we don't want to over beat it anything yeah it looks good it's kind of broken up a little bit but it's not super cream yes what we don't okay cool so next we're gonna add we've got two types of string I've got caster sugar and soft light brown sugar 160 grams of each they're going straight into the bowl and that's gonna go back on for about kind of 30 to 45 seconds yeah in the bowl you'll see that the sugar in the butter have kind of form a little nuggets which is kind of what we want so this is where everything goes a little bit strange normally at this stage I'm making cookies or cakes or something you'd add your eggs but we're not gonna do that we don't want to find anything we don't want to with anything so we're gonna go in with our chocolate and our walnuts yep and I think I'd be fair to say at this stage you could if you don't have a family to like this one you can just do it by hand because we're not trying to whip anything or cream anything we just literally want to combine them together okay so that's just combined again to bring it all together not to wit anything and now we're gonna put our dry ingredients in yeah so in this bar I've got 200 grams of self-raising flour 300 grams of plain flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt quarter teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and 2 teaspoons of baking powder if you didn't catch all that all the ingredients are in the description box but they okay I caught it and we're gonna tip all of that in again just combine it so that's had only again about 30 seconds yeah if you come a bit closer you can see that this is just that really fine powdery breadcrumbs and that is exactly what we want and then once we add that egg into it it will kind of bring it together and combine it a little bit to give that chewy dense it's not too cakey or creamy texture that we're really looking okay so we've got two large eggs in here oh my goodness and we've already whisked it out because we really don't want to beat this for long at all so we've already done a part of the job by whisking it together when I've dumped all of this into the mixture turn it on and combine it all okay that is the cookie dough made and we just mixed it and it all kind of came together as one big joke yeah and it's kind of clean the sides of the bowl because it's a really thick paste it's not quite it's already wet and we're going to weigh out our cookie so it will nice and even and we're gonna go for a hundred and twenty-five grams we tried all sorts of different sizes and 125 seems like a good quantity of cookie and then we're just gonna take it and push it together a little bit like this but we're not rolling it into a ball and I think this is gonna make about 12 cookies and then the sad news is that they do have to freeze for about 90 minutes so we're gonna bake them straight from the freezer but do not fear we've been here a day and we have a perfect waiting in the freezer for us yeah I'm not spread about this is that you just leave them in the freezer if we don't gonna make all of them straight away from this bake them from frozen because that's what we're gonna do right now yes so you've always got cookies in your freezer [Laughter] [Music] okay that is our last cookie we've got 12 even cookies here Jane's gonna get those wrapped in cling film and tried in the freezer and we've got up and set to 180 degrees C with a fan and that's hotter than normal because we want to get that nice crispy outside shell that keep them gooey in the middle and we've also got a baking sheet in there heat C which is a tip we kind of found out through trial and error and it's really great because that's hot so it's gonna get the bore of your cookies nice and crispy as well so our oven has got to temperature the baking tray is really really hot so I'm gonna pull this out really carefully and Danes gonna flop on six cookies really well spaced out because they will spread that with me you don't want to end up with cookies they're also stuck together okay and then they're gonna go in for 17 minutes and the outside will be a little bit golden and the inside will be nice and gooey [Music] they're out with the other men and they've cooled down for about five minutes yet just sort of let them get the heat off but they're still nice and one which is the best way too young and they've gone nice and golden and they're still kept their nice chunky shape and the bottom of them is nice and cooked and golden too and that's because we put them on the hot and baking sheet that was already in the oven yeah so stick it let's dig it okay let's see what they look like inside today three two one oh good they are just the half baked gooey goodness inside that we are looking for and they've still got that crispy shell on the outside juicy crunch and then the goo exactly and if you make these be sure to Instagram them and use the hashtag cupcake Gemma so we can see all of your posts absolutely and if you're wondering what to buy yourself or as someone else for Christmas don't forget that we have all our lovely puppy p.m. and merchandise tonight to these lovely oven gloves on cupcake Gemma calm yeah they really are genuinely like and I use them at home and she'll be back soon and we'll take her cookies don't worry she'll get some of these maybe I mean we might eat these ones yeah I hope we have to eat every day okay [Laughter] [Music]", "m_BIJ1j1_-c": "now i've always been more into savory food than sweets make me choose between chips or cake and i choose chips any day but there's one type of sweet that i can't really resist and that's cookies chocolate cookies white chocolate macadamia cookies and woolies dream chuck chip cookies but more recently mochi cookies have come to my attention and in today's video we are going to try and make that before we start i want to thank miso and the new sesame street line for sponsoring a portion of today's video but more on that in just a little bit now i wanted to somehow tie in today's video with mini show and their sesame street launch and this is probably a bit of a fast stretch but i thought big bird is a pretty iconic character in sesame street maybe i can do a roast chicken video then that probably isn't the most appropriate and then i thought cookie monster why not i try to make some cookies in this video but not just any cookies these cookies have caught my eye recently they're mochi cookies and they seem easy enough to do i don't know i mean if i can do it anyone can do it right so today we're making two types of mochi cookies a chocolate chip one and also a matcha white chocolate we are going to start with making the mochi first so we need glutinous rice flour corn starch sugar butter and milk we add this all into a bowl and i need to check the measurements but that's kind of the gist of what we need to do to a bowl add 20 grams of corn starch 15 grams of sugar 70 grams of glutinous rice flour and then give it a quick mix after that add 140 mils of milk and give that a good mix until it looks like this now most instructions typically say to steam this but i've seen other people put this in the microwave so put some glad wrap on poke some holes in it before putting it into the microwave for about a minute see it looked pretty liquidy so i put it back into the microwave for another minute it looks much better after that and while this mochi mixture is still hot add 15 grams of butter to it and give it a good mix until it's all melted kind of like this after that set this mochi mixture aside and just let it rest okay so i'm just letting the the mochi rest over there it looks pretty okay and so now we move on to the cookie dough we're making two different types today like i said the matcha one and also the chocolate one we are starting with the choc chip cookie dough and this is what you're gonna need i'll also put everything in my description so first up we're meant to mix together the butter the sugar and also the eggs so to a bowl add 100 grams of softened unsalted butter 80 grams of brown sugar and then mix see it looked okay and the consistency looked right until i added an egg in and when i stirred it turned into this which looked nothing like the youtube video i was following i don't know what happened but i added the egg and the butter and then the sugar and now it's turned to this really weird consistency and then i read somewhere that you're not meant to add all the egg all in one go because it splits the butter and the egg so i don't know what went wrong so i tried it again and it turned out exactly the same so i tried out another recipe and this is actually take three this time around i added 120 grams of softened butter half a cup of brown sugar a third of a cup of caster sugar to a bowl and then mixed it with an electronic mixer until it was smooth then i cracked an egg into it and continued to mix the consistency of this definitely looked better than my first and second batches i have no idea why they turn out like that but if you know it please enlighten me then shift in one and a half cups of flour add 20 grams of cocoa powder and half a teaspoon of baking powder before mixing it all together yeah this looks about right really yeah okay the cookie dough for the chocolate chip cookies it looks okay for now but we do need to go out and get some more ingredients because i screwed up my first two batches i don't know why the the egg and the butter just when it mixed together it looked like it just doesn't look right so we're gonna go get some more eggs we're gonna go get some more butter and while i'm out getting the additional egg and butter i want to thank minisho for sponsoring this part of the video so recently i received a package from a brand called miniso which is a company that sells a wide variety of different products from stationery to electronics to household items and the reason why they're sending me this package is because they have a new line coming out and they want me to do an unboxing and discover some of the items that are on this line so they've previously done something like this with marvel and this time around they're doing it with sesame street so they're launching an online pre-order period from the 1st to the 15th of september and they've given me a discount code to share which offers 20 off i also put this in my description so you can just copy it if you need it do note that this discount code is only available in their online store during the pre-order period and only for their sesame street line so without further ado let's cut into this box and see what's inside oh this is actually really cute this is a big bird oh wow there's quite a bit of stuff here there's also a there's also a cookie monster oh wow what is this this is a sesame street waterproof pouch what would i put in here my passport oh i can put my phone in here if i'm like going swimming or something i guess and i can still use my phone through this bag and this is a this is a decoration piece it's just a decoration piece to put on your desk we also have oh we also have a cookie monster backpack how many compartments are there there's just one but there's a pouch in the front all right so in conclusion we have a cookie monster backpack waterproof pouch a cookie monster ornament we have this is actually a puppet i didn't even realize until um my sister told me and a cookie monster soft toy all right so like i mentioned before the pre-order period is from the first to the 15th of september in their online store for the sesame street line so if you use my discount code and you see anything that you like in the online store you can get 20 off but note that this is only for sesame street only for the online store and only during the pre-order period which is the first to the 15th of september so have a browse see if there's anything you like and yeah go from there all right i am back from the shops i've got all the extra ingredients that i need my chocolate chip cookie dough has been in the fridge for about 20 minutes but we're gonna start making the matcha one first and here is what you need for the matcha cookie dough all of which will also be in my description so to a mixing bowl add 170 grams of softened butter a cup of brown sugar half a cup of caster sugar and then mix it together until it looks like this then add one egg and one egg yolk one tablespoon of vanilla extract and mix them all together until they turn like this actually looks better than the first one yeah yeah i think so too then add two cups of flour one tablespoon of matcha powder half a teaspoon of baking powder and sift it all in like so before mixing everything in together until our matcha cookie batter is done we are done with all our cookie dough we've got our matcha cookie dough we've got our chocolate cookie dough and we're going to be adding chocolate chips and also white chocolate chips into each of them respectively and also we've got our mochi just waiting to be pulled it actually turned out really good looks really really beautiful actually imagine if i accidentally dropped it in the sink so now we move on to putting the mochi inside the cookie so take some cookie dough flatten it out like so take some mochi roll it into a bowl and put it onto your flattened cookie dough and then fold it together kind of like a dumpling uh kind of like this yeah and then add some chocolate chips on top do the exact same thing for the matcha cookie dough add the mochi in close the dough up flatten it add some chocolate then leave it on the tray i didn't really do a good job at keeping the sizes consistent so if you do try this out definitely try to make the sizing more similar all right we are done i've got one two three two twelve cookies some have mochi some don't we're gonna put it in the oven and then hopefully hopefully i've left enough space between all of them but i'm really excited to see how they turn out then put them in a preheated oven at 180 degrees and bake for about 10 minutes all right the timer just rang we think it's pretty much done it smells really really good so we're gonna get the cookies out we're gonna cool it on this rack and then we're going to pull it apart and see if it works i'm really excited [Music] all right here is the matcha cookie this is the matcha with white chocolate what did shock me was the amount of sugar and butter that went into these cookies this is not bad i was just hoping for the mochi to be more sticky so that when i pulled it apart it would have been more like beautiful but the mochi itself tastes quite good i'm quite proud of myself let's try the chocolate chip one this one was a good one yeah that was a really good one even looks like snot this just tastes like your regular chocolate chip cookie with a bit of mochi on the inside personally i prefer the matcha one there was less sugar in this one as well so after eating the matcha one this one tastes a lot less sweet even though we did put a lot of sugar in this one as well but overall i would say that you know it's a relative success i really like the matcha white chocolate cookies and i think i'm going to end the video here if you're still watching thank you so much for watching till the end i post new videos every week so check them out if you have time i hope you have an amazing rest of the day and i will see you in my next video [Music] bye what do you think about the cookies i really like them do you like the matcha one better or the um encore really i like the much ones better do you notice the matchy inside i think both flavors are really good", "eszjdImrV6c": "hi guys and welcome to cooking with karma now this week is all about cookies

the white chocolate chips the coconut and the cherries then give that one final mix until all of those ingredients are well incorporated through then all we need to do is spoon our mixture out onto a pre lined baking tray then into the oven for about 10 to 12 minutes let them cool on the tray for a couple of minutes first before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely now for half of

microwave is different so just know that your cookie could take between one minute and one minute and 15 seconds the second most important thing to know is to not overcook your cookie your cookies should come out of the microwave still soft as you can see when you pick it up it's gonna be really soft so let this cool for about five minutes otherwise it's gonna be too hot to handle and the cookie will just fall apart how amazing does this look you would think this was made in a regular oven if you love warm soft baked cookies you have to try this this gooey delicious and satisfy make

sugar this brings a bit of good the texture along with caramely sweetness I'm using a mixer but a bowl and a wooden spoon would be just fine once the mixture is soft and combined add vanilla paste or extract and then beat in an egg I've got some plain flour ready in a bowl and before I go any further with this I need to add a little salt and bicarb then beat this into the butter and sugar mixture just gently until it coheres when my children was small they'd have eaten most of this batch by now finally fold in some chocolate chips I like very dark teeny chocolate chips for this and the pots I cook these in a small - I hate the word ramekin but it's ramekins I need for these so there it is I'm making six even though I'm feeding four as I've said before I am never knowingly under catered one final touch I smooth the tops with a crank spatula they'll need around 15 minutes in the oven", "QyT6EmSEFM4": "everybody loves a batch of freshly baked oatmeal cookies and when you give the gift of cookies in a jar well it just makes everyone happy it's easy to do for a one liter jar what you need to do first is combine your dry ingredients I've got 3/4 of a cup of all-purpose flour and then two types of sugar 1/2 a cup each of granulated sugar and dark brown sugar I do like to add a little spice 1/2 a teaspoon each of ground ginger and ground cinnamon and last just a touch of baking soda so this you just whisk together and part of making your cookies in a jar look pretty is layering the elements starting with the dry ingredients to get them into the bottom of the jar without dust

In this video I will show you how I make white\nchocolate cookies. They are so good and simple to make and they\ndon't require allot of ingredients For these cookies you will need: Butter All purpose flour An egg Vanilla extract, baking soda and salt Brown and white sugar And chocolate To the flour add salt and baking soda and\nwhisk it together. The exact measurements will be in the description\nbox down below. Now to the butter, add the brown and white sugar Here I am creaming the butter and the sugar The butter should be at room temperature,\nthat while make it much easier to cream it. Cutting the butter in cubes can also make\nit easier to cream. You can also do this with a kitchen machine\nif you have one. Eventually it should look like this Now add the egg* and vanilla extract So after the egg has been incorporated, add\nthe flour You want to mix it until you see no more flour,\nbut don't mix any longer Then lastly add the chocolate, I used regular\nchocolate which i chopped in cubes because I couldn't find chocolate chips for baking. But if you do not set the oven too high, that\nshouldn't be a problem. So after the chocolate has been incorporated\ntake a spoon, or an ice cream scoop, to make dough balls. So after I formed the balls, I put it in the\nrefrigerator for 30 minutes. Then put them on a lined baking sheet, make sure to leave some space in-between as\nthey will spread in the oven. My oven was a bit too hot, so the browned\nmore than their supposed to. But if you bake them in a preheated oven on\na temperature of 175 C for about 8-10 minutes, you should be good. The sweetness combined with the salt makes\nthem absolutely delicious. You can also freeze in the dough balls, and\nwhen your ready to use them just take them out of the freezer. Let it defrost and pop them in the oven. Thanks for watching guys!

ever had and it's a lot like a brownie - so when I was researching recipes for genius desserts I kept coming across this type of flourless chocolate cookie that was so beautiful it has these like glassy crackle etops and these really like fudgy chewy centers and it's very surprising because it doesn't have any of the normal stuff you would think you would see in cookies no butter no oil no flour no egg yolks like to hold it all together it has very few of those ingredients and yet it makes a perfect cookie so I started looking into this I believe that any time you see a flourless chocolate walnut cookie that looks like that it can be traced back to one pastry chef Francois Payard we reached out to his patisserie and we're trying to find out more about the cookie and we got an email back from Francois himself and he just said call me and he told me this story when he came to America he set up his first patisserie in Manhattan in 1997 he didn't want to compete with American cookies like chocolate chip and so he started thinking about the French macaron when you start to compare the ingredient lists here of this cookie with the macaron it all starts to make so much more sense [Music] so in a funny way when he was trying not to compete with American cookies he ended up making something very quintessentially American a brownie and cookie form there's a lot of powdery stuff in here so starting it on low is a good idea so you don't get the big poof [Music] okay so that just needs to be combined once the egg whites go in will kind of beat the heck out of it so it's starting to get sticky like brownie batter I forgot the vanilla it's supposed to go in with the egg whites but it's okay I'll just add it now a whole tablespoon [Music] okay so this is it it just gets scooped and baked now so these make big cookies it's a quarter cup measure or you can use one of those cookie scoopers you can make them smaller but I like that they're so big because you get a lot of that chewy middle so you do want to make sure you spread them out really well these are gonna go in the oven at 350 for about 14 to 16 minutes and they won't look glassy and crackly and delicious when they come out so when I was testing these four genius desserts I really wanted to like really fine-tune the instructions and make sure they came out perfectly every time so we ended up testing them probably five or six times and they would sometimes like come out a little bit flatter sometimes a little bit puffier the batter would sometimes be runny or sometimes it'd be thicker and even when we were like using the same grams of ingredients every single time they were always good and they always had the qualities that we were looking for the glossy tops with the crackles the crispy outside the chewy inside like the very like chocolaty fudgy walnut flavor and so we realized there are some things you just can't control four eggs are gonna be different the weather's gonna be different your mood is gonna be different your equipment is gonna be different I have not tried doing it by hand with a whisk if you do try it let me know I think you would just want to chop the walnuts finer because they won't get quite as bashed up as they do in the stand mixer I can just eat so check that out doesn't that look like the best brownie you've ever seen it's got that like a ripoli shiny top and the inside is just pure fudge and studded with walnuts just a big hat for myself so it really is the perfect hybrid it is kind of like a macaron on the outside and then inside it's just pure fudgy American brownie for more genius recipes like this every single week be sure to like this video and subscribe to our Channel maybe pick up a copy of genius desserts and I will be bringing new recipes

more fun to bake together you", "ztgRn7Ek1po": "Today on Sugar Spun Run, we'll be\nmaking cookies and cream cookies. Hey Sugar Spun Bakers! Today's recipe is\na sort of cookie inception. We are taking some perfectly good Oreos, breaking them\nup, and baking them inside these cookies and cream cookies. Now today's recipe is\nso simple you don't even really need a video but I already did my makeup and\nthe baby sleeping so we're gonna go ahead and shoot this anyway. Plus I love\nhaving these cookies in my house. Now the first thing you're going to need is a\nlarge bowl, and we are going to add one and a half sticks, or 3/4 cup of butter,\nto this bowl, and you want this to be unsalted butter that's a softened to\nroom temperature. We're also going to be adding three ounces of softened cream cheese. I love the cream cheese in these cookies. It gives them a nice depth of flavor makes, them extra soft. So good and plus it fits in with our cookies and\ncream theme. Now the next thing you're going to need is 3/4 cup of granulated\nsugar. And a lot of you know I love using . brown sugar wherever I can. So we're also using 1/3 cup of firmly packed light brown sugar. Now you're going to want to use an electric mixer, and we are going to beat these ingredients together until they are very creamy and well combined. This looks pretty good so we're going to add 1 large egg. And by the way, don't copy me.\nYou should never crack your egg directly into your mixing bowl. You should always crack it in a separate bowl. That way if any shell gets in it's\njust easier to get out, but we didn't get any shell in,  so we're good this time. So now we're also going to add 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. And we're going to stir everything together with our mixer until it is well combined. Pause right here. Scrape the sides of the bowl. Make sure everything really is truly well combined. This looks perfect. So we're going to set our butter mixture aside, and we are going to need a\nseparate bowl for our flour. This recipe uses all-purpose flour, and you will need two and two-thirds of cups. We'll add a teaspoon of cornstarch. 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda. And just 1/4 teaspoon of salt. We'll stir everything together so\nour dry ingredients are completely combined. Alright now let's bring back\nour butter and our cream cheese and we are going to gradually stir our flour\nmixture into our liquid ingredient mixture. Keep your mixer on low speed so\nyour flour doesn't go flying everywhere. Just going to add the flour about a\nthird at a time. Alright so this looks pretty good. Let me\njust take a look make sure there no hidden pockets of flour. Everything's\nwell combined. S o it looks pretty good so now we are going to add some mini chocolate chips I like to use 2/3 cups of mini chocolate chips. And of course we\nare going to need our Oreos. So you will need 12 Oreo cookies, or chocolate\nsandwich cookies, for this recipe. And we're going to break them up before we\nadd them into our batter, and we are going to smack them around a little bit.\nI am just going to use a rolling pin, and you don't want them to be crushed in\ncompletely into fine crumbs. I personally like to have some discernible pieces of\ncookie in my cookies and cream cookies. So break them up according to your\npreference but make sure you leave some pieces in there. This is also a great way\nto get out any pent-up anger, like when your husband sets his alarm clock a\nlittle bit too early and it wakes up the baby. He's filming this right now so\nhe'll appreciate that. Okay so our cookies are nice and crushed. So we can\ngo ahead and add these into our cookie dough batter. Looking good. Alright now we'll just stir everything together and I like to do this part with my spatula rather than trying to use my mixer. Now once your Oreos and your\nchocolate chips are nicely combined into the dough, it should look a lot like\ncookies and cream ice cream. We are going to have to chill our cookie dough. N ow\nyou'll just want to cover the bowl with some plastic wrap. This will just keep it\nfrom drying out while it's chilling in the fridge. And we'll chill this for 30 minutes. Now about 15 minutes before your cookie dough is finished chilling, before you're ready to bake the cookies, you'll want to pre-heat your oven to 350\ndegrees Fahrenheit. When your cookie dough has finished chilling, and your oven is preheated, we can go ahead and start scooping this. Now we're just going to scoop this cookie dough by about a heaping one and a half tablespoon sized scoop. And you can drop this directly on to your baking sheet and bake it as a drop cookie that way, but one thing I like to do to make my cookies a little\nmore uniform and round, is I like to just quickly roll the dough between my palms\nfor a nice round cookie dough ball. That's optional. It just makes the\ncookies look a little extra nice. And you will want to space these cookies about\ntwo inches apart on the baking sheet. They're not going to spread a ton, but\nthey will spread a little bit. So you want to give them some space. I don't\nknow about you but I am so excited to eat these. We'll take these over to our\n350 degree Fahrenheit preheated oven where we will bake them for about 10 to\n12 minutes. Now you'll just want to let these cookies cool completely on their\nbaking sheet before enjoying. Once they've cooled, we can go ahead and dig\nin. That is how easy it is to make these cookies and cream cookies. I told you you\ndon't even need a video for this. If you try this one out, please let me know what\nyou think. I always love hearing from you. Thank you guys so much for watching and\nI'll see you next time. These are good.", "oMmHmHtirFk": "welcome friends today we are going to\nmake something that is the meeting point of two things that I really enjoy and\nthat's chocolate chips and potato chips this past Christmas and over the last\nlittle while I saw a lot of people making this type of cookie and I thought\nwow that's ingenious I really love that let's give it a try see if we can make\nit ourselves so in the stand mixer I put some butter and we're just gonna\ncream that until it's nice and fluffy now once the butter is nice and soft\nwe'll put in some white sugar and some brown sugar and we'll just keep\ncontinuing to cream that well that's creaming together just take\na moment and prep your flour so I have flour and this is baking soda and you\njust want to mix those two together you'll also notice it I'm not gonna put\nany salt in normally in a cookie like this you'd put salt in because that just\nsort of regulates the flavour balances it out but we're putting in the potato\nchips and don't get the low salt potato chips get the regular salty greasy\npotato chips and they're gonna bring a loads of salt to these cookies one of\nthe one of the tricks I found is don't open the chips too early because if\nyou're like me you'll snack on them and there won't be enough to actually make\nthe cookies so you need about 200g of chips and you want to crush them not\ncrushed to dust but you know crush down too but the same as the as the chocolate\nchips that you're gonna put in okay this is good we're gonna put in a little bit\nof vanilla maybe just a little bit more and the first of two eggs and we'll beat\nthat egg in before we put the second one in okay so far pretty straightforward\nregular chocolate chip cookie recipe this is creamed together really nicely\nand I'm just gonna slowly spoon in the flour a lot of people are gonna tell you\nthat you have to do this with a wooden spoon because you don't want to make\ngluten bla bla bla bla bla bla bla spooning it in like this is not a\nproblem as long as the mixer is on low enough so that you don't spray flour\neverywhere which is something I often do you're gonna be just fine\njust don't over mix so you put the last scoop in mix it in just until it's mixed\nand then turn the mixer off of course an important step along the way is to\nscrape down the bowl sometimes a little bit I'll get stuck up at the top or at\nthe very bottom and you just want to make sure that you've got everything\nincorporated evenly okay so we are down to the point where we're going to put in\nthe chips and the chocolate chips and you could do this with a rubber spatula\nor probably better to use a wooden spoon I'm just going to give it a scrape with\na spatula first and I'm gonna put the chocolate chips in first this way we\ndon't crush the potato chips too much before we put them in the oven and I\nwill switch to a wooden spoon at this point because the dough is pretty stiff\nso the last of the chocolate chips and in go the potato chips so I'm using a number 50 ice cream scoop\ntoday to portion out these cookies I think the 50 is just a touch too small\nand I can't find my number 40 it's lost in the equipment room somewhere I think\nnumber 40 for me anyway 40 is the size that I I really like so I'm just gonna\nportion these out I don't do anything special with the\nwith the cookie tray or the baking tray a lot of people like to put down\nnonstick spray or parchment paper I never do I don't know I never have\nproblem with them sticking and I never have a problem cleaning the trays later\nso I just leave them bare and once I get them portioned out to me I think a\nreally nice little touch is a sprinkle of sea salt on top just to give that\nlittle extra salty explosion of salty sweet when you eat them now into the\noven okay so moment of truth now on the\nsurface they look really good nice spread still a bit of a dome top they\nlook mmm super crispy around the edge but still chewy in the center I really\nlike that um I'm pretty impressed with these cookies it's interesting you don't\ntaste the potato chip I can still see a little piece of potato chip in there and\nthey're adding something but they're not adding a flavor they're kind of adding a\nbit of a texture and it almost feels like they're lifting all of the other\nflavors really interesting addition a little bit of salt on top it really adds\nto it as well so if you like chocolate chip cookies and you like potato chips I\nthink you should give these a try I really I'm really going to enjoy these\nthanks for stopping by see you

community on donald's kitchen dot com and let's get cooking hey guys i am super excited to be launching my brand new website donaldskitchen.com which is all about easy recipes an automated meal plan and customized shopping lists it's super simple to use and to give you a teaser here's one of the recipes from the website it is a one pan skillet chocolate chip cookie that everyone can dive into with lots of vanilla ice cream it is phenomenal [Music] now i'm all about nailing your mid-week meal plan but sometimes you need a sweet treat and this one pan chocolate chip cookie is the way forward it's only a handful of ingredients that you most likely have in your kitchen store cupboard and it's all combined in this now what you are going to need is a greased oven proof pan and once you have that ready to rock and your oven set to 160 degrees celsius we're good to go so into a bowl with two types of sugar some caster sugar and some light brown sugar and it's the combination of these two sugars that's going to give you that irresistible toffee chewiness to this beautiful big cookie so to this some softened butter now with a hand mixer you just want to get this beaten until it's light and fluffy this is the kind of sweet treat that just ticks all the boxes so to our butter and sugar mix we're going to get in there with one large free range egg and just beat that until it's nicely mixed through now for our dry ingredients i've got some plain flour some baking powder and some baking soda for some flavor some vanilla extract and when you've got your dry ingredients in there very gently and slowly start to incorporate them right the dough is pretty much good to go so just time now to fold in some dark chocolate and some white chocolate chunks give that a good mix through and try not to eat the dough at this point which is what i'm always tempted to do and just to finish it off and to balance out the sweetness that's in there a little pinch of salt goes a long way as soon as you have that rough cookie dough this actually works quite well if you freeze them as logs and you can slice up cookies to bake in the oven or if you're doing this method you literally take that entire cookie dough mix and pop it straight into a skillet or a frying pan and then using the spatula just press it into all the edges now the true trick to getting really great texture on your cookie dough is to rest it so at this point now we're going to pop it into the fridge and let it rest for about an hour now i know that step of chilling the dough is an extra one and it takes a little bit more time but it will make a difference to the end texture of this cookie dough so at this point now that it has chilled it's going to go into the oven it's going to cook for 20 minutes now just have a look at that one pan chocolate chip cookie and it is essential if you're cooking this in the oven in a pan that you make sure that you use one that is an oven-proof handle and that you make sure that it's completely covered with a towel when you bring it to the table now we're going to finish it off by adding some ice cream just to the top and then it's just a case of digging in three little ice cream scoops that just melt into that hot cookie mixture now to serve it up bowl spoon let's go come on beautiful soft melted cookie and then that gorgeous scoop of ice cream on top now all that's left to do is dive in and try some you've got beautiful melted ice cream you've got really tender cookie and a bit of chew wow oh it's this intense sweetness that you just want it wraps you up in a bowl of beautiful cookie comfort now if you want the recipe of course it's on donald's kitchen i know you're going to want to try this so check it out and let me know how you get on [Music] you", "LcpgppiC3aI": "hey everybody thanks for joining me on another episode of cutting up with bae today we're about to make some fat chewy delicious chocolate chip cookies before we get into the recipe hit that like button and hit that subscribe button and check out the description box for all the information below now i have my kitchenaid mixer here if you don't have a kitchenaid you can use a hand mixer if you don't have a hand mixer i suggest that you just invest in one they're about 20 maybe 30 dollars at the most but it will help you in your bacon adventures here i have some melted butter i have some white sugar and some brown sugar and i'm mixing it on low [Music] while this is mixing i'll give you one of bae's baking tips and one of my tips for baking is make sure your items are at room temperature so if you're using eggs if you're using butter if you're baking with cream cheese you want to make sure all of that stuff is at room temperature so that way it blends well so i added some vanilla extract and now i'm going to crack an egg and i'm going to add that i'm going to mix it until it's fully incorporated while this is mixing i'll give you another one of bae's baking tips and one of those baking tips is to leave the oven shut don't open it and close it and open it and close it set the timer and let it bake back in the day there was a saying and it went something like set it and forget it and that rings true because you don't want to disrupt the baking process here i've added just a little bit of salt and again i'll leave all the specific measurements in the description box below now i'm adding my flour to this mixture and this is where the magic kind of happens because it's transforming into cookie dough right before our eyes now i don't know about you but i like milk chocolate i also like white chocolate of course white chocolate really isn't you know traditional for this recipe so i used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet you can use bitter if you want to but i absolutely do not like bitter chocolate so milk chocolate for the win and i added not only milk chocolate morsels but i also took some milk chocolate hershey's and i broke those up into pieces and added them as well so i have my oven preheated i'm going to take this cookie dough i'm going to turn these into a couple cookie dough balls i'm going to bake these things in the oven for about about 9 to 11 minutes depending on how soft you really like your cookies and voila you have some fat chewy chunky delicious cookies now if possible you want to let the cookies cool off give them about 10 or 15 minutes but if you can't wait 10 or 15 minutes because i can't wait 10 or 15 minutes then head over to the damn refrigerator get some milk so we can dump these cookies and we go cool them off the manual way so we're about to break our cookie open and it looks amazingly delicious to me it looks super chocolatey um don't expect a chocolate pool from these because again i like to let them cool off a little bit so i'm not scraping the top of my mouth but in a nutshell this is beige chocolate chip cookies based banging chocolate chip cookies you guys try my recipe come back let me know how you like it and if you need some merchandise check out cutting up with bay.com and if we're not friends on social media add me but i want to thank you guys for your time you guys have a good afternoon and until next time peace out you guys [Music] [Music] bye [Music] you", "9OWbLG5Hstw": "So I have been searching high and low\u00a0\nbaking cookie dough after cookie dough,\u00a0\u00a0 eating cookie, after cookie looking for the\u00a0\nInternet's chewiest chocolate chip cookie.\u00a0\u00a0 And I believe I found it and it includes my secret\u00a0\ningredient. You're not going to want to miss it.\u00a0 Start out in a nice big bowl. Into this I'm going\u00a0\nto add in room temperature butter and if people\u00a0\u00a0 ask me all the time, what type of butter do I use?\u00a0\nI try to use Irish butter or Kerrygold when I can,\u00a0\u00a0 but I always use salted butter why?\u00a0\nBecause that little bit of salt as\u00a0\u00a0 extra flavor to all of your baking, it\u00a0\njust makes everything super delicious.\u00a0 So now you want to cream your butter, or I'm going\u00a0\nto use an electric hand mixture and you can use a\u00a0\u00a0 standard mixer, or you can do this step by hand.\u00a0\nYou're just going to need a lot of elbow grease,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's totally doable. So I'm just going to\u00a0\ncream this on high speed and just let it get nice\u00a0\u00a0 and fluffy. Just takes around 30 seconds or so.\nSo this is looking good, into this I\u2019m going to\u00a0\u00a0 add in my Brown sugar, and this is really\u00a0\nimportant in your chocolate chip cookie\u00a0\u00a0 recipes. Cause it gives you that kind of lovely\u00a0\ncaramel tones and it makes them really gooey in\u00a0\u00a0 the middle as well. I'm going to follow\u00a0\nthat with a little bit of white sugar.\u00a0 Okay. Now for my secret ingredients, duh,\u00a0\nyou're not going to believe this, but it is\u00a0\u00a0 olive oil. So here's the deal. Olive oil adds\u00a0\nextra moisture to your cookie dough. That\u00a0\u00a0 extra moisture gives you a chewy chocolate chip\u00a0\ncookie. This has also loads of flavor. I just\u00a0\u00a0 use regular olive oil, nothing too crazy strong.\nIt's naughty. It's a little bit. Salty. It has\u00a0\u00a0 loads of flavor. And trust me is just catapults\u00a0\nthe flavor of these cookies to another dimension.\u00a0\u00a0 I did try this cookie dough with regular\u00a0\noil and it didn't have the same flavor. So\u00a0\u00a0 trust me on this, go with the olive\u00a0\noil and you will not be disappointed.\u00a0\u00a0 So for your olive oil in there, turn back\u00a0\non your hand mixer for doing it by hand\u00a0\u00a0 on a high speed.\nAnd we want to whip these up\u00a0\u00a0 really well for roughly four to five minutes and\u00a0\nlet them get nice and big and light and fluffy.\u00a0\u00a0 So, like I said, I did test this recipe using a\u00a0\nvegetable oil and although it did make it nice\u00a0\u00a0 and chewy, you didn't get the same flavor that you\u00a0\ndid from the olive oil. If you at home, want to\u00a0\u00a0 use a natural oil, coconut oil, whatever your oil\u00a0\npreference is, feel free to use the same amount.\u00a0 And that's totally fine. But trust me, olive oil\u00a0\nis far superior. So a lot of you already know\u00a0\u00a0 my best ever chocolate chip cookies, and those\u00a0\nare kinds of goofy ones, but they're not chewy.\u00a0\u00a0 So these are different. You're definitely going\u00a0\nto want to try both recipes. So this is lovely,\u00a0\u00a0 nice and light and fluffy, just the way I want it.\nSo when I enter this, I'm going to add in my eggs.\u00a0\u00a0 And I also going to add in a nice big tablespoon\u00a0\nof vanilla extract. Now that is not a typo. I\u00a0\u00a0 wasn't supposed to say teaspoon, tablespoon,\u00a0\nthe vanilla in these cookies. Just make it so\u00a0\u00a0 delicious. So don't be scabby with the vanilla\u00a0\nextract. Okay. And then what you want to do is\u00a0\u00a0 just cream, all of these together, again,\u00a0\njust for a few seconds until they combine.\u00a0 So once your eggs and vanilla are in there and\u00a0\ngo set that over to the side, I'm bringing in\u00a0\u00a0 my flour. Now into my flour I am going\u00a0\nto add in a little bit of baking powder,\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of baking soda and of course,\u00a0\nsalt. And then just give those a stirrup.\u00a0\u00a0 So I'm gonna put the flour over here and\u00a0\nnow I wants to talk to you very seriously.\u00a0 It's my serious tone about chocolate. Now let\u00a0\nme tell you some of the best chocolate chip\u00a0\u00a0 cookies you've ever had, have not been made with\u00a0\nchocolate chips. They have been made with a big\u00a0\u00a0 old bar of bittersweet chocolate. Now this is\u00a0\nwhat I like to use because you get big chunks,\u00a0\u00a0 little chunks, little speckles, all the way\u00a0\nthrough out, but this just melts into your cookie.\u00a0 With chocolate chips, they stay the same\u00a0\nshape. You want to get a nice big bar,\u00a0\u00a0 preferably around 72% cocoa solids of\u00a0\nchocolate. Then just chop this bad boy up.\u00a0\u00a0 Leave some big chunks in there. Nice and\u00a0\nrough. And this is what you want to add\u00a0\u00a0 to your chocolate chip cookies. It's\u00a0\ngoing to make the world of difference.\u00a0 Trust me. So you check that out. I'm not sure I'm\u00a0\ncoming across cupping chunk of chocolate melting\u00a0\u00a0 in your cookie. I mean just absolute heaven.\u00a0\nOkay. That's looking good. And I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 bring back in my cookie base. I'm going to add in\u00a0\nour flour and our dry ingredients, and then I'm\u00a0\u00a0 going to scoop it. Had our chocolate all in there.\nIt's delicious. There we go and spatula and let's\u00a0\u00a0 mix this all together. Okay, so this is our dough,\u00a0\nbut here's the thing. We added an olive oil here,\u00a0\u00a0 so we made it extra wet. As you can see, it's a\u00a0\nvery soft dose. So this has to go into the fridge\u00a0\u00a0 for at least four hours. Let it get\u00a0\nnice and cold before you bake it off.\u00a0 What I like to do is age my dough, and\u00a0\nI've written all about this on my website.\u00a0\u00a0 It means putting your cookie dough into\u00a0\nthe fridge for one, two, five, six,\u00a0\u00a0 seven days. I do it all the time. What happens is\u00a0\nyour cookie dough just gets more flavor and just\u00a0\u00a0 makes for really delicious cookies. Delicious.\nI strongly recommend taste the raw dough and\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to know what kind of\u00a0\ncookies you can Look forward to.\u00a0\u00a0 Right now, I'm going to cover this\u00a0\noff and pop it into the fridge.\u00a0 When your dough is cold and ready to go. Scoop\u00a0\nbig tablespoons of dough onto your cookie sheets.\u00a0\u00a0 Give them a little bit of space in between\u00a0\ncause they will spread while baking.\u00a0\u00a0 So another little sneaky trick for the\u00a0\nchewy chocolate chip cookies. Bake them\u00a0\u00a0 at a high temperature for a short amount of time.\u00a0 So bake at 375 degrees fahrenheit or 190\u00a0\ndegrees Celsius for around 12 to 13 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 Just a short amount of time to get crispy\u00a0\non the outside and chewy in the middle. I\u00a0\u00a0 don't want you to go anywhere though, because\u00a0\nonce these come out of the oven, I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 show you the best cookie trick to give you the\u00a0\nultimate bakery style chocolate chip cookies.\u00a0 Amazing. And they're fresh out of the oven. I\u00a0\nneed to do a pan bang straight away, but I've\u00a0\u00a0 got a baby sleeping in the back of the house.\u00a0\nSo I'm going to have to improvise. So I've been\u00a0\u00a0 baking a lot of cookies and this is not the first\u00a0\ntime I've used my front porch to do a pan bang.\u00a0\u00a0 So Sarah Kieffer invented this.\nAnd it's a fantastic trick.\u00a0\u00a0 It pools the chocolate. It kind of just makes this\u00a0\nlike flow. And then it also gives your cookies,\u00a0\u00a0 this lovely crinkle. So come here, check these\u00a0\nout. I am beyond delighted about how these\u00a0\u00a0 turns out they look perfect. And while they're\u00a0\nstill warm, they are definitely best enjoyed.\u00a0 So Kevin, come on in. Alrighty. So I'll have to\u00a0\nadmit, I've tried about a dozen of these and they\u00a0\u00a0 keep getting better every time. Chewy. Lushy\u00a0\nall that nuttiness from our secret ingredient.\u00a0\u00a0 Chewy chocolate bakery, style cookies. I mean, the\u00a0\nfact that we're going to be able to make things at\u00a0\u00a0 home now you're never going to have to leave the\u00a0\nhouse again. Check out all my other baking videos.\u00a0\u00a0 I've got tons more and we'll see you back here\u00a0\nreally soon. Thanks for everyone.

recipes you literally dump everything in half with chocolate chips and you mix it we're gonna step up adding our butter there we go so pass the sugar I'm also add in brown sugar because I want a little bit of texture for an a always with large eggs bicarbonate of soda then use only a tiny amount if you don't have that one use a little bit of baking powder and that's a salt that's a tiny bit of salt and you mix a lot of that together for about ten yards that means it's nicely incorporated and then we're gonna add in our chocolate chips we're all mixed up and now I'm gonna add in the chocolate chips you could go for a mixture of white and dark or just milk I was gonna cut our chocolate chips with I really like that flavor and now it's gonna mix don't want to break up those

still and they'll harden up as they cool down and then we can enjoy it here's a great tip how you can get this company better out and I usually tend to use a spoon or you could use a spatula you could also fill all of this mixture into a bowl first and then spoon onto your tray I do I would just be very very careful because you have some really sharp blades in there and you don't want to go in with your fingers like me I always do it all the time because you know that's me you know me guys but you do use a spoon it's much easier like that [Music] cookies are done and they're barely cool and I've got another batch in the oven anyway because you know I can't wait and I'm gonna tap into one I know they're still quite warm they usually do crisp it up as they cool but we just want to know what

there from the domestic geek one hungry mama and entertaining with that to kick off my Christmas cookies add some softened butter into a large mixing bowl to that you want to add caster sugar and then using a wooden spoon beat the butter and the sugar together the key thing here is to beat it until the mixture becomes light and pale once the mixture has changed consistency it's time to add in the eggs add the first egg and give it a good beat until it's completely incorporated take your time with this and when it's smooth again add in a second egg adding the eggs one at a time like this will prevent the mixture from splitting you when you're left with a light and voluptuous looking mixture it's time to add the dry ingredients first off some plain flour follow this through and try not to get it all over the table like I have once it's completely combined to give the cookies a lift mix through some bicarbonate of soda now it's time for some festive ingredients dried cranberries and some white chocolate which will give the cookies great sweetness next up for a sweet crunch and texture sprinkle in some rolled porridge oats it looks like quite a lot here but take your time mixing them through and you'll be left with an even looking dough using two tablespoons form small balls of the dough and transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper leave enough space between the cookies to allow for spreading and then place the tray in an oven preheated at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes when they're done take them out and allow you to cool completely on a wire rack I love to finish them off with a drizzle of white chocolate over the top and just because it's Christmas a little sprinkle of edible gold stars check out these little babies they are so so simple very generous looking cookies and when you bite into them you've got my mother's fault you get sweetness you get crunchiness you get a little bit of chewiness and then there's these great little pops of

making something a really really yummy and these are my double chocolate white chocolate chip cookies and here the ingredients that we need 3/4 of a cup of cocoa powder 2 cups of all-purpose flour 2 eggs 1 cup of brown sugar 1 cup of white chocolate chips this is 225 grams 1 cup of unsalted butter 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt a recipe note if you are using salted butter simply remove the salt from my recipe so those are the ingredients so let's get started for our first step I'm gonna get all of our nice butter into a large bowl okay that's good too that my white granulated sugar and our brown sugar so I'm just gonna break that up a little bit with a fork and whenever you are measuring out your brown sugar you want to pack it tightly into your measuring cup so as you're pushing it into your cup push it down so that it gets really really nice and compact like you see here once you see that the whole mixture is starting to come together we can add a little bit of moisture a lot in my first day in our second day and then I'll add in my vanilla all that in my salt [Applause] and then we'll sifting our dry ingredients so we'll get our lovely cocoa powder in there and all of our flour and our baking soda grab the back of a spoon and I'll just push this through we'll grab our mixer speed number one I'm just gonna slowly start incorporating all of the dry ingredients into our wet so we're about halfway there another minute or so and we should be done okay so this is about a minute later and it's all nicely mixed so for our last thing we're gonna take our chocolate chip so I'm just gonna get those in there and what I did was I opened up the package and I took a few out and we're gonna keep these out to put on top of our actual cookies just before they go into the oven and now I'll just mix these in quickly so we're all set to go I have my cookie sheet here and a piece of parchment paper this is optional you can go directly onto your cookie sheet if you wish but I'm gonna use parchment today I've got myself a medium sized scoop and you can do this by eye just with a spoon but I'm just gonna go and use my scoop today okay once that is done now we have the little chips that I had leftover and you can just take these and just put them on the top do three or four it doesn't really matter so I'm gonna pop this into my 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes so my first batch is done and it's cooling now I did those for 10 minutes the second match I'm going to show you something slightly different I'm just gonna take my fork and I'm just gonna press a little bit onto each one and then I'm gonna put on the chocolate chips and pop these into the oven for the same amount of time ten minutes so I've just zoomed in just to show you the three different types so these are the original ones these are the ones that I scooped out and I did not push down at all then we have the ones that I scooped out and I used our fork okay those are there and then these ones here are the ones that I used with the back of the spoon and also push those down so there we have the three different types so you have three slightly different looks and all of these were baked for the same time ten minutes in my 350 degree oven and the last thing let's break into one of these and I'll just show you how nice these are look at this these are completely cooled by the way and look really really nice and moist nice and chewy you you want them a little bit more firm you want to go about 12 minutes but look at that mmm really really good mmm I love these so that's it for today's video if you enjoyed it please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that so that's it for

"dWzniPCLpqU": "- If you love soft and chewy cookie bars with big notes of brown sugar,\nvanilla, and white chocolate, then this blondie recipe is for you. Hey, you're watching\n\"Preppy Kitchen,\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to\nmake delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These blondies will be ready in a snap. So, let's get started. First off, I'm prepping a\nnine by nine inch baking dish with parchment paper. It makes it so easy to\nclean up, get it out. There's no fuss, no muss. Give your parchment paper\nfour snips on the corners, and then you can fold up. It seems random, but I've gotten a ton of\nrequests asking me to show how I line baking dishes. So, this is for you. Fold up the edges, and now it should just float in basically. Here you go. Okay, this is all prepped and ready to go. I'm going to set it aside. And now it's on for the dry ingredients. Into a medium bowl, I'm adding 2 1/2 cups or 300 grams of all purpose flour. There's a measuring cup\nin here, but it's okay. We'll make it work. Second time that's happened. Really want to encourage you\nnot to add too much flour. If you've ever had dry or\nbready baked goods come out, and I followed this recipe to\na T what is happening here, it's probably because\nyou added too much flour just by accident during\nthis measuring process. So important. Okay, one tablespoon of cornstarch. When you use cornstarch in a baked goods, it can make things a\nlittle bit more delicate and, like, melt in your mouth. One full teaspoon of salt,\nkind of seems like a lot, but this is almost like\na salted caramel brownie, except it's called a blondie. So it has white chocolate\nchips, but a lot of brown sugar, which gives you that caramel flavor. And when you have all that sweetness, you want to balance it with salt, too. For leavening, I'm using\none teaspoon of baking soda. And, in case you're wondering, the acid that's in the brown sugar will react with the baking\nsoda for the leavening. Give this a quick whisk, and set it aside. Scale's done too. Now time for the butter. In a large bowl, melt 3/4 of a cup or 170 grams of butter. I'm using unsalted butter, but if you only have\nsalted butter at home, just use half of a teaspoon of\nsalt in the dry ingredients, halve the salt. To the sugar, I'm adding one packed cup or 200 grams of light brown sugar. This is the main flavor of your blondie. It's that caramelly, brown\nsugar, amazing taste. Brown sugar and butter are the business. 2/3 of a cup of granulated sugar. One and two. In you go. So, you could definitely use an electric hand mixer for this part, but I am going with a whisk. So just break it up, and you're going to mix it\ninto a delicious slurry. Just make sure you're breaking\nup all that brown sugar. Sometimes you can have a lump in there. Okay, that's what we end up with. That's what you want. Now, it's time to add our\nremaining wet ingredients. The other predominant flavor\nwe have, of course, is vanilla. So, if possible, use a nice\nquality vanilla for this. And I'm using one tablespoon or 15 mL. That's a lot. Finally, two room temperature eggs. So, one. In you go. And now you are going to\nwhisk, whisk, whisk it up until it is really, like, very smooth. You're trying to dissolve some\nof the sugars in this step. So, on your marks, get set, go! And whisk, whisk, whisk,\nwhisk, whisk, whisk. If you have a few lumps\nof brown sugar in there, it will be okay. They're basically like the sugar version of a white chocolate chip. Dump that dry mixture in,\ngracefully if possible. Ooh, cloud. And now you're going to mix\nthis until almost combined. It's being a really soft, fudgy batter. But instead of chocolate, it is like a... almost like a butterscotch taste to it. Speaking of which, I'm\nusing white chocolate chips in this recipe, but you\ncould add walnuts or pecans, macadamia nuts. And if you don't like white\nchocolate chips, toffee chips? Butterscotch chips. This is really close\nto coming together now. All right, I still have some\nlumps of flour left in there, but it's okay because I'm gonna fold in those\nwhite chocolate chips. So, you know, you'll keep mixing it, and you're not going to overmix it. So, here I have about a cup\nof white chocolate chips, and I'm just gonna reserve\na handful of them for later, at the very end. These can get dumped in. Now, fold those chocolate chips in. I usually, like, pile my measuring cups with chocolate chips or nuts\nbecause I love them so much. But for this recipe, I used, like, almost closer to 3/4 of a cup of\nthe white chocolate chips. So, it was like a stingy cup just because this is really rich and\nit doesn't need, like, an abundance of white\nchocolate, just the right fit. We're going to transfer this into our prepared baking dish now. These are still set aside, Transfer your mixture to\nyour prepared baking dish. Plop. Okay, spread it out to the edges. It will self level a bit, but it's always a good idea to give it as much of a headstart as possible, especially because you\ndon't want the center to take too long to bake. These are going to be\na little bit underdone when you take them out. It's kind of like a fudgy brownie. So you're not going to have it be like a solid, baked cookie bar. It's going to be a little\ngooey, which is amazing. Once everything's all spread out, just sprinkle with some\nwhite chocolate chips, just like you would with a regular cookie. And one of my favorite things\nabout the white chocolate chips here is as you bake\nthem, they actually caramelize, and they become a little bit\nless sweet and take on, like, a deeper flavor. It's actually pretty nice. Bink, bink. All right, into the oven, 350 Fahrenheit for 30 to 35 minutes. On the lower end, they'll be\nlike a little bit underdone and fudgy in the middle. And on the upper end, they'll be more fully done and cookie-like. My blondies baked for 35\nminutes, and I set them aside, hard as it may be to not touch them and just let them cool, cool, cool. Because I want to remove them from my pan without them collapsing. Okay, see, look, was that easy? Parchment paper is such a godsend. Now, nice sharp knife. If you want to know how to cut\nthese without mangling them, would be to use a sharp knife and kind of score the top of it. Then you can press down. Perfect. That's what you want to see. All right, continue scoring and cutting. These smell divine.

chocolate macadamia cookies now these cookies are just exactly like the chocolate chip cookies only instead of pecans or walnuts we're going to use macadamia nuts and instead of the little chocolate chips we're going to use white chocolate yeah I wanted to show you this because I think it's a little confusing this is not white chocolate it's not white chocolate at all but it is is all the things that white chocolate has except instead of using the cocoa butter they're using palm oil and palm oil kernels so this is definitely not white chocolate so we are for sure of not using this and the purpose this is white chocolate and you can use it too you can see the picture cut strawberries and fruits you can use the other for that too but this actually has cocoa butter in it so the ingredients are white chocolate sugar cocoa butter milk nonfat milk soy emulsifier emulsifier artificial and natural flavors now and the other one if you read the label it's got the palm oil in it and a lot of people say they can't tell this is chai I can actually taste a little of a chocolate of this and that's what you want so we're going to make the cookies using this now it comes in packs wrapped individually now when you see when you have an old chocolate bar and I don't know if you've ever seen an old Hershey bar or Milky Way or something like that and it's old and you open it up and you'll see the white stuff kind of on it you think oh that's probably mold it's not it's cocoa butter that's that's leached out to the surface so what white chocolate is is a byproduct of the cocoa industry really and I'll just tell you a real quick story on this several years ago well more like 25 years ago we were in San Francisco and we stand a real fancy hotel and you know when you saw all the sides and one night we were just kind of out walking in the area and well it but a night it was probably five or six o'clock and there was a little cookie store there so of course I'm always in for sweets so I asked my husband said can we go in there and see what that God let's get some cookies and then all the cookies were super hung made it was just a little bitty kind of hole in the wall and the cookies that they had one of them was white chocolate macadamia cookies so I said well we're going to try those I got about four of them and we went back to the hotel and I was eating them and they were delicious they were just so good and we had gotten the chocolate chip too so I told my husband I said boy I'm will see if I can't figure out how to make these it seems just like chocolate chip cookies except for this white chocolate that said them and the macadamia nuts now that's the first time I'd ever had a macadamia and I thought they were just very delicious so we got back to South Carolina I started shopping around and lowered the whole food line that was open in there they since closed in our area but they were open been and in the basket in a big basket that set on the floor in the baking now there were these big blocks of white chocolate that's what it said white chocolate they were laying them out and wrapping them up just like he would meet and putting a little tag on over the way in the price so I went ahead and bought one and then I found the macadamia nuts in a jar about that tall I don't remember how many ounces it was but they were $7.99 and I said well I'm just don't get them anyway because those cookies were so good and sure now when I used the same recipe as the chocolate chip cookies and just used the white chocolate and the macadamia nuts they turned out exactly the same so you could say I've been making these for about 25 years now my husband has always want me to make them because he just super loves them so anyway he's been talking about it ever since I started videoing different recipes which was last August this is the following July he's at least once a week this is why don't you make some of those cookies well part of the reason was I couldn't find this now I don't know when the Baker's came out with this white chocolate but I did try several years ago making them with these yeah I remember I think unless I'm mistaken that the Nestle company called these white chocolate but they are anything white chocolate this okay and I'm not saying these aren't good but not for this recipe so anyway that's enough of that story I want to show you how you'll have to do these chocolate pieces now I've already got one choc Duff what you have to do is take them out of the wrap book now first I want to show you the difference between the two that's why I open that package let me get some of those out can you see the difference in the color I hope it shows up on the camera these are much wider than this white chocolate needs to look sort of a cream tan color almost a really super light gold color that's how you know it's white chocolate okay so to chop these up let me move in close what you'll need to do it's going to come like that and I think you get six of these squares in this box and you do need all of them for this recipe take a serrated knife that's very thin you don't want to use one of those great thing chopping knobs you want to use a very femme Knight just cut it down the middle break the two in half and then you want to just slice it down then and after you do that after you get it sliced it's going to break into several little pieces so you can just kind of break it in half or thirds and that's what you're looking for for the cookies okay so I'm going to go ahead now and chop all these other little blocks and I want to shave the nuts before we break off from that these were not available 25 years ago but they are now each one of these little packs I think costs 250 and for these cookies you'll need two of them two packs you can get them in Walmart now before when I thought I'm in the little jar they were $7.99 that I don't remember the ounces but anyway what you'll need is one cup so that's going to take two tags now for those of you who have never seen this kind of nut before and by the way I think these are grown like in Hawaii or somewhere and when I bought them in the jar they were together you know like they were gonna break apart kind of like split peas do and into two halves and we'll eat that one mm-hmm just as good as I remember okay so and you can also when you get these just put them if you want to keep them for a while and just put them in the freezer and they'll keep very well okay go go ahead and chop up my a little white chocolate and we'll be back and put this all together okay we have cut up all the chocolate and I've mixed the macadamia nuts with it and we're going to set that aside and we're ready to get our cookies together all right one cup of softened butter now I put this in the microwave for just a few seconds and then I kind of break it up with a whisk so to this 1 cup of softened butter you want to add 3/4 cup of white sugar 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar kind of mix that in with the whisk to start out with get the lumps all broken up into the first you're gonna add two eggs I'm just going to put my gum in the same time 1 teaspoon of salt put that right in and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and I think that's about all that's left in this little bottle so I'm just gonna pour it in if it was a little more that would be okay all right now we're just going to mix those eggs break them up a little bit and get it all mixed in with the whisk and you could use an electric mixer at this point if you wanted to I just think the whisk is easier plus it's just one little item to wash this and base it up pretty bit break up any little lumps of that brown sugar that you see then just cream it all together really okay that's probably about good enough white sugar there okay and you're through with the whisk you won't be able to really use that anymore now you're going to add 2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour and I just this is a 2 cup manager I just added another fourth cup to the top of it so you're going to type that in and I usually do about half of it and work it in with a spatula just get it started okay now I'm gonna add 1 teaspoon of baking soda now this is not baking powder it's baking soda let me show you this same can you put in your refrigerator to make it smell good baking soda and just sprinkle that all around and then mix that all in just going to dump the rest of my flour in this is gonna make a really stiff could be better okay we've got a lot of that in now it's not totally incorporated but I'm gonna go ahead and dunk my white chocolate in macadamia nuts in there cuz that'll actually help to get it mixed in thoroughly so I'm just gonna dump those in then just start using my spatula to press everything and get those nuts and the little chocolate chips thoroughly incorporated in there and of course you see that we're mixing the rest of them Wow ran at the same time you just really have to kind of mix it around and mash it to get it mixed there's a little piece of brown sugar just that brown sugar is too hard to even mesh up so I take that out now if I hadn't found that little piece of be okay because it would certainly melt in the oven alright alright this is pretty well mixed in there now you could go ahead right now and start baking your cookies but if you just go ahead and put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or so you'll find it a lot easier to load the cookies up on the cookie sheet so I'm gonna chill this for about 30 minutes and we'll be back I can fund a finger to cut the camera off there we go alrighty we have let our cookie down somewhat cool I'll tell you a little trick I use I actually put this in the freezer because my freezer is one of those frost free so it has a little fan and they cool really fast now you can't forget them because I've done that and just left them in there and the whole thing froze but what I do is put them in there for about 15 minutes and then just take my spatula and go in there and you know turn the the batter over and that way it gets cold bastard yeah I'm gonna try to use this again I've tried this on other cookies and I never am able to make this work I can try greasing a little miniature ice cream scoop but we're gonna try it one more time so yeah I make my missile ice cream suit holes one tablespoon so I'm making that a heaping tablespoon because I really like a bigger cookie so they'll put them on this sheet and that's gonna probably hold about 12 cookies in this somewhat works now if you cook these run together you can just take a little spatula while they're still warm and you know scoot them apart a little bit I'm gonna see if I can't yeah twelve I might only be able to get ten on this sheet and also you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees and these are going to need to cook for about nine minutes or depending on your oven you might need to cook them for eleven minutes but you wouldn't want to cook them any more than that because you want them to be sort of chewy on the inside and a little crispy on the outside okay actually only got eight on this cookie sheet now mr. Syd has a salary go ahead and put more cookies on this sheet because as soon as I get done I'm gonna put these right straight in and also I'm going to put my cookie dough batter back in the refrigerator while I'm waiting yeah if you have a big oven you could probably took two at one time which would be good let's see it's already getting too hard to get these out of a little scoop another little tip I might add is that all the macadamia nuts I really do think that the kind you get a little back and pack jar are better than these that you get in the pack you know the little cellophane packed but I think that the ones in the jars are more expensive but I do think they're better and I haven't looked this up I think I remember looking it up before and I remember that the macadamia nuts I believe are grown in Hawaii now it might be why they cost so much but you can also make these cookies with using pecans or walnuts and I've done that before and they're really just as good but I guess then you could call them white chocolate neck cookies but anyway alright I'm going to go ahead and get these in the oven 375 degrees for nine to eleven minutes and we'll be back okay the first batch of cookies are gone now what you want to do is leave them sitting on the cookie sheet for about two minutes then you want to transfer them to just a little wire rack but what actually happens I think they cook a little bit more just sitting on their hot cookie sheets so leave them two minutes then just transfer them to the little rack to cool alright when I finish baking all these will be back okay this is our last pan cookies and I wanted to show you I did have three of them that cooked together while they're still on the cookie sheet and still warming just put your spatula in there and kind of push them apart alright so I'm ready to take out the last of the cookies and again you do want to leave them sitting on the cookie sheet or a good two minutes and they will finish cooking a little more now these cookies do just exactly like the regular chocolate chip cookies do in that they puff way up then they fall back and that's what makes them you know chewy on the inside or really moist and then a little crispy on the outside okay we're gonna have one now here's what it looks like see how it's not like crispy or she don't really want them crispy just crispy around the edges and on the bottom and on the inside it's very moist okay few little tips if you use parchment paper on your cookie sheet that works a lot better now I ran out of parchment paper so I just had to use the regular cookie sheet this is no this is yes okay now there is probably many other brands of white chocolate but just please make sure it says white chocolate and then turn it around and read the label because in order for it to be called white chocolate it's really gonna have to have cocoa butter in it otherwise it's really not white chocolate and that's what this is palm palm oil excuse me and palm kernel so you don't want that I mean I think he muses for other things but not for this particular cookie now I have made these before with walnuts I've also made them before with pecans they're just as good and I would strongly recommend if you can defend the macadamia nuts if that's what you want to use in the jar that you get the kind that are in the back impact jar and I would say that I got probably three dozen cookies because of course I made mine bigger than then what the recipe calls for because the recipe says you can get five dozen out of this recipe and I'll be honest have never gotten five dozen it's always less because I made the cookie bigger anyway I sure hope you'll try these I know you'll like them now if you're not a really big chocolate fan you will love these cookies okay because there they really don't have that chocolate taste now I can taste it a little bit but most people wouldn't be able to taste it alright see you next time", "4-E8HF929cc": "Welcome back to Keep Calm and Bake. My name is Caroline and I also do a YouTube\ncooking show. Now at this episode I am going to teach you\nhow to make some raspberry and white chocolate cookies. [music] There is not that many ingredients to this\nrecipe, which is good. I got fresh raspberries. We are going to use fresh raspberries and\nsome white chocolate. I am going to put them to one side, we do\nnot need them until after we finish the dough. For the dough; butter, self raising flour,\nsugar, and condensed milk. Two hundred and twenty-five grams of unsalted\nsoft butter going into my food processor, my mixer. Oh, there you go. Two hundred twenty-five grams of caster sugar,\ngoing in. And we are going to use half the tin of this\ncondensed milk. So this is approximately four hundred grams\nso about just under two hundred, one ninety lets say. I do guestimate a bit. Beat these together, until it become light\nand fluffy. Super, that is light and fluffy. As you can see there. I am going to add my flour. I am going to do this in two batches, so I\nam going to pop half of it straight in and I am slowly start blending this all together. Okay, next lot going in. You can find all the quantities and the full\nrecipes in the description box. Excellent, as soon as the flour is mixed in\nyou can stop beating it does not need to be really well beaten like a cake batter, you\njust want to make a nice soft dough like this. There you go, see. That is perfect, it is like play dough. Now for the fun part, you can roll the dough\ninto balls, and I am going to pop onto a baking tray. So I am going to use about, about that much,\njust like a dessert spoon a heaping dessert spoon full will be plenty. Because you got to remember they are going\nto spread out once they start cooking. So that's going to go straight onto my trey,\nsquish it down a little bit like that. Now you can add your raspberries, that's the\nfun bit, the raspberries going in and the white chocolate, not going to eat it going\nto put it into the cookie. Yum. Ok so just a couple bits there, then what\nwe will do get some of the dough just want to squish it, you can squish it pack down\nagain just so it kind of encases it a little bit. Keep going until you have used up all of the\nmixture, and then they are going to go straight into the oven. The nice thing about this recipe is that you\ncan experiment and put whatever bits in that you like, so do let me know what you would\nlove to see in cookies, maybe its blueberries, maybe it it just chocolate. So something for everyone, make them your\nown, but yeah I love hearing from you guys so write your comments below. Look at all these cookies! So this mixture makes about 22 okay. These are going to go straight into the oven\nthe oven is on one hundred eighty celsius and I put all the other conversions on the\nrecipe for you. There only going to take about ten to twelve\nminutes so you need to keep an eye on these to make sure they do not burn. My cookies are out of the oven. Now do not forget to hit subscribe to get\nplenty more recipes like this and also you can take a look on my YouTube cooking channel\nfor tons more recipes. I hope you all really enjoy these and see\nyou next time. [music]", "0zsITyssWjs": "best bites forever hey what's up everybody it's chef Alicia and today I am making chocolate chip pecan cookies and this happens to be my very favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies so we're gonna start off here with two sticks of butter one cup of white sugar one cup of brown sugar and one teaspoon of salt now I'm gonna cream all of those things together now it's very important for you to understand the creaming stage when you're making cookies because the creaming really affects what your cookies turn out like so I just want to give you a little bit of a tip for this particular cookie we're gonna blend it to a smooth paste we're not gonna cream until it's light and fluffy if you cream until it's light and fluffy you're gonna incorporate more air and you're gonna end up with a lighter cookie because that air that you incorporate is gonna become part of the leavening and you're definitely gonna have a nice light cookie but I want like a thick dense chewy chocolate chip cookie so that's what we're doing we're creaming to a paste and this is what it's going to look like when you get it to a perfect beautiful pace so when it looks like this stop the thing that I'm going to add into my yummy cookies is two eggs these are two regular old large eggs and I'm going to mix these in I'm on low speed but I have a pretty powerful hand mixer so you may need to be on medium I'm gonna blend these just until they're incorporated because again I do not want to add a whole lot of air to these cookies I want to keep them thick rich and dense the next thing that I'm adding in here is some vanilla paste you can use regular vanilla if you would like to kind of depends with me if it's like kind of special cookies which these are because again these are one of my very favorite recipes so I'm using my vanilla bean paste it's a bourbon vanilla bean paste and it's Nilsen Massey is the brand that I happen to like but there are others out there the next thing that I'm doing is I'm going to mix together my dry ingredients what I have here is my baking soda my baking powder I have a half a teaspoon of each and I also have about somewhere between a quarter of a teaspoon and a half of a teaspoon of and then three cups of white flour sometimes when I make these I like to do them whole-wheat like if I know the kids are gonna be eating a whole bunch you can do like two and a half cups of whole wheat flour with a half a cup of wheat germ but then you need to add a couple tablespoons of water so anyway moving on we're using all white flour today and you just need to mix it until it's incorporated again that's just the theme of the day because we don't want to make these fluffy we're trying to have thick chewy cookies so I just mixed in that first half of my dry ingredients which notice I stirred my dry ingredients together that was kind of a key thing that I wanted to show you when you mix like your baking soda and your baking powder into your flour and my little nutmeg I put in there you want to make sure you stir it up so that it's kind of even before you even add it into your cream sugar and butter that way the it incorporates nice and evenly into the batter so as you can see this is a super super dry dough that's something that we want because the more liquid that you have in your cookie batter the more it's going to spread but this is also a temperamental dough so I'm showing you here the texture is just a tiny bit more dry than I want so I'm going to add one tablespoon of water now you may not need that tablespoon of water you need to touch your dough and feel it and see if it crumbles like minded but that one tablespoon see you're still gonna have the same kind of texture when you look at it see when you look at my dough it's not really coming together it's not you know coming together into the one ball and it's not real moist but see when I squeeze it together it's more like if you were making say a pie crust and it holds together just like you see here so that's kind of the texture you're looking for okay so the next thing that I'm adding in here is one cup of chocolate chips and one cup of pecans which I have broken up into like fours or so and normally I would tell you to stir these in with a rubber spatula but again this is a really dry stiff dough and you will get a serious arm workout if you try to do that and maybe you're way stronger than me which is totally cool except that I don't want to have a sore arm tomorrow so I'm using my hand mixer and I have a pretty strong hand mixer so it can handle it I'm gonna give it a little stir here just to make sure everything is getting incorporated in there nice and evenly and again I'm just gonna check my batter and then I'm gonna go ahead and play with my food because it's fun and also because I am going to try to mash everything together and make sure that everything is incorporated now it kind of looks like I'm doing a kneading motion here which I guess I kind of am but I am NOT kneading my dough you do not need cookie dough because well everything hates cookie dough but that's not what I mean okay you don't need your cookie dough because if you do it's gonna end up like weird and funky and stiff with tough cookies and that's not what I'm doing I'm just trying to match all my chocolate chips and pecans in there and also I'm gonna grab all those little guys stuck to the bottom of my bowl because they are very tasty tuna Swee don't want to leave them out so this is what your dough should look like it should kind of mash together if you try to mash it together okay here is my portion scoop this is a number 20 portion scoop if you don't own a portion scoop that is okay you can do it by tablespoon so a 20 portion scoop is the equivalent of 1.6 ounces by volume not by weight so that's just over 3 tablespoons we're gonna go ahead and put them out onto the sheet pan by scoop fulls or by tablespoons or whatever you're doing you don't have to space them too far apart because they're really not gonna spread because again we did that really stiff dough I'm going to bake them on 350 degrees and my oven they take 16 minutes and I rotate them halfway like you know switch the pan around during cooking so eight minutes in open your oven turn around the pan take them out let them sit on your sheet pan for about one minute then put them onto a cooling rack which is where minor chilling here now when you're cooling your cookies you don't want to have them like in a draft you don't want to try to cool them too quickly because that's what makes sure cookies crack when you're cooling them so if you have cracked cookies that's what your problem is you need to make sure that they're just having a little bit more cooling time so maybe put them in a little bit warmer of an area of your kitchen and then here are my pretty cookies they're all finished look how thick they are I mean seriously are they like beautiful cookies hi cookies okay I am going to eat you now so everybody enjoy and you can get this recipe on my site best bites forever calm happy cooking everyone back bite for and calm", "-Spbs97Dktk": "hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make a white chocolate chip blondies these have been crazy requested so I figured why not make it tonight so to make this this is what you need need some all-purpose flour some regular granulated sugar some brown sugar white chocolate chips and sour cream unsalted butter an egg baking powder salt and vanilla extract so it's a very basic ingredient but they're going to be really good white chocolate chip blondies are basically like a white version of a brownie everything is white so first thing you want to do get you oven nice and hot - 350 second thing you want to do is take an 8-inch an 8x8 baking pan like so spray it with nonstick cooking spray and lay the bottom with some parchment paper just to ensure everything comes out okay all right so the butter is very important the butter is at room temperature this is almost melting because it is kind of hot in here with all the lights it's very important otherwise it won't incorporate well with the sugar and to that you're going to add both sugars the brown sugar and the granulated sugar I'm actually just going to switch to my whisk and just cream this together that looks perfect now before I go any further with that I'm going to take my chocolate chips and I'm just going to take some of the flour about two tablespoons or so and I'm just going to mix them in this is so that once we coat all the chocolate chips with the flour it prevents them for sinking into the bottom of the pan and it just makes sure that they're evenly throughout the batter which is what we want just stir this those up and set those aside to the remaining flour I'm going to add my baking powder in my salt stir that up so I have these tube ready for me now to this I'm going to add in my egg just crack in a separate bowl because as I always said you want to make sure you don't get a bad egg some vanilla extract like so and the sour cream now sour cream just it's very little now about two tablespoons but it keeps this very moist and you can always substitute this with some whole milk or yogurt would work really well for this too just make sure it's not flavored so if you don't have sour cream that's the perfect alternative just mix this up now that we have all about wet ingredients incorporated what I'm going to add in our flour mixture just mix that up and last but certainly not least I'm actually just going to switch to my spatula because I want to be able to fold my chocolate chips my white chocolate chips through now that we have our white chocolate chips mixed through we're going to put this on our prepared pan so it's nice and greased up so nothing sticks there's no point I'm making something delicious if it's not going to come out remember that so it might it might be a little extra step to line the bottom with parchment paper but it is worth it so just patiently with a spatula just spread this till you have one even layer that looks just about perfect great now we're they're gonna be so good they're not going to super a heavy and dense they're going to be just perfect they're gonna go into your free and oven for about 25 to 30 minutes when it's about 25 minutes take a toothpick insert it into the middle if it comes out with no wet batter on it you know it's done they're going to let these cool and taste them together now I let these cool completely because now we're gonna cut them out just take a knife run around the edges just to loosen it just like that and it should come out pretty easily don'tdon't the knob but I'm not going to take off the bottom yet because I'm just going to use it to cut them out now you can cut them as big or as small as you like I think size is smell so incredible I can't wait to dig into these I can tell that the inside are gonna be really moist look I'm going to go for the middle piece look at that I can see that the insides really moist all the chocolate chips sorry I'm like a squirrel or nuts they're so good I love white chocolate I love adding hot chocolate white chocolate my favorite favorite favor when I started the recipe I had one cup buh-bye time I made it I'm sure I had like a half a cup ok picking up the MA these are super simple guys they've been getting requested like the optimized Oh everyone's been asking for them so now you have them to get the recipe with everything written down just go on to my website you today's Twitter question comes from crazy about Demi they asked what made you realize your passion for cooking what do you recommend for us beginners well I've always loved cooking I was a little girl you know I grew up in Italy tall was 12 years old so I was cooked with my mom and mostly my grandmom but when I really realized that a passion for it was when I moved to the States and I was very very homesick and you know people say that looking through pictures and stuff reminds you of people and brings you back to wherever you were but for me I turn to cooking I turn to things that I made with my grandmother I turned to things that I made with my mother the smells the taste the look of it just really like fed my soul more than anything else and that's when I realized food is so much more than fuel it's just feasible it feeds my soul and it gives me memories it makes me think about places I've been you know people I know I think about people through food I think about my memories through food and I would recommend to any beginner that deep thing deepened down inside what makes you happy what you think about what you enjoy eating family recipes that you can make family recipes you can change up just have to be something you're comfortable with stick with you within your comfort zone until you're you're think you're ready to go to step outside of it and to learn something new that's what I would recommend now if you have any questions for me tweet me at Lars kitchen don't forget the hashtag Laura metalli", "Vz6V70OKm_I": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how to make cranberry white chocolate Blondie's they're perfect for this time of year I'm using fresh cranberries in this recipe with fresh cranberries as I'm sure you know they're very very tart so paired with a sweet white chocolate they're fabulous and I'm going to just add a little Clementine zest for an extra seasonal spin but they're just so good you're going to love that then I went you through the list of ingredients you need all purpose flour baking powder and salt brown sugar and granulated sugar white chocolate chips these are fresh cranberries you see the bigger ones that cut in half in the smaller ones I slept whole I've got some unsalted butter that's been softened different temperature I have one small and a Clementine which is optional one egg a little milk and some vanilla extract I've got my oven preheated to 350 I have a 9 by 9 inch baking pan lined with parchment and sprayed within a little nonstick spray I love this recipe and I think you will too it is it's so simple but like it has all those beautiful flavors from this time of year they're jacketing they're dense or like it's just it's really really fantastic and I think you're going to love it I'm adding my butter and both kinds of sugar to a large bowl and I'm just kind of just by hand you can use of course a mixture but I'm just going to this by hand all I'm going to do is just make sure that deep butter is just well mixed with the sugar and then there are no lumps anywhere okay at this point I'm going to add my egg vanilla extract I'm going to add just a little bit of Clementine zest you don't have to if you don't want to add any orange flavor but I just think it goes so well together and then the way it perfumes your home as it bakes see I'm very very partial to citrus in my sweets especially around this time of year especially Clementine because coming tine orange because I grew up eating alcohol or kind of Tolan it and they have citrus running through them except to me just the smell of it is just like symbolizes holiday so that's why I try to add it in anything and everything because it makes everything to me much more festive so but you can't leave it out and some milk not a lot just a bit and at this point I switch to a whisk because it makes it easier and I'm going to whisk everything together until it's combined if you are not a fan of tartness because as you bite into the clam you know into the cranberries in this they will be charged you can use dried cranberries it won't give you the same flavor but it still be delicious it doesn't matter but I really like this excellent now I'm going to do is I'm going to add everything else in together at the same time say dry ingredients white cup of chips and my fresh cranberries and I'm going to switch back to my spatula and fold it all in until it's combined look at just the color of that and that to prepare pans try to get it all out of there every last dip and then just get it as even as possible now these are not going to be super thick it said it's a such a blondie not a cake but if you wanted them to be a little bit thicker you can by all means place them in an 8 by 8 rather than a 9 by 9 and it would be a little bit thicker but this works perfectly these are going to go into your preheated oven it's 350 for about 25 to 30 minutes but let them cool and I'll show you what they look like when they're done my Blondie's baked for about 30 minutes I've let them cool completely and now we're going to slice and dig into them we can cut them as big or as small as you want I like little small squares because they're really rich you know and I always find them a little slice of something is perfect so when it's too much sometimes can disrupt your stomach and trust me if I can say that you have got to believe me because I will eat you I will eat an entire week and I don't care but sometimes oh it's better to have a little like a taste it's like a it's like almost like you're you're teasing you know what I mean rather than a big piece so I just like to cut them into small little squares wait everyone's happy and if somebody wants to go for seconds they can it's looking such look at that gorgeousness can we just appreciate that for a second I appreciated it enough so good it's like sweet just finished on the white chocolate complements the TARDIS from the cranberries perfectly they're everything and we belong on your table this holiday season no matter what's the occasion go Laura in action calm I hope you enjoy spending time with me cook at that recipe they look so good I'm

already prepared most of it so let me show you you just with a small paring knife take off the green bits and any tacky bits that you feel don't belong in the cookie and then cut it into three parts depending on how fat the strawberry is and then you cut off the end bits like so and we are going to keep that separately because those are very pretty and these center bits are going separately we are going to use these end bits on the top of our cookie you'll see this as we proceed with the video to my chopped strawberries here what i'm going to do is i'm going to take about a tablespoon of our flour this is not separate flour this is flour from the recipe okay and we're going to mix it now this is going to create a little coating on the outside of the strawberry and it'll help keep everything kind of dry and not bleed okay the flower is a nice absorbent of moisture so that's exactly what's happening here but we are not putting any on the ends because this is going to go on the top in my large bowl here i'm going to take softened butter as you can see this butter is quite soft which is exactly what we want we don't want it to be too cold not too melted either okay such an easy recipe guys okay now to this we're going to add some powdered sugar you can use some caster sugar if you want i love recipes which just need like a bowl and a whisk or just a bowl and a spatula because minimum cleanup easy peasy right okay now that we mix that in we're going to add our egg now those of you who don't consume eggs you can use replace this egg with 40 grams of either mashed banana or cream cheese both of them will work in this case so just mix it in i'm going to switch to my whisk just whisking that in now we are not trying to aerate the mixture or anything because it's a cookie we don't need a lot of aeration here but we just want it to be a nice smooth mixture okay that looks good at this point i'm gonna add my homemade vanilla extract i have a recipe for this on my youtube channel i'm gonna link it for you in the description box if you've not watched it already or use any good vanilla extract this is just gonna give a nice floral flavor and aroma okay that looks good super simple now to this we are going to add our all-purpose flour ok some baking soda all of it some almond meal if you don't have almond meal you can just powder some almonds and you can use that here just some just powder some in your mixi and use that okay that looks fairly good and now to this we are going to also add some fennel seeds or soft because this is going to give such a beautiful complementary flavor to the strawberries do not miss this out so so so beautiful and don't use the you know the kinds which is like refreshments like mukwoas don't use that use the raw one which doesn't have any sugar or anything okay that looks good at this point i'm gonna switch to my hand you just want to sort of get everything together don't need the dough okay it's not bread it's not roti none of those it's a cookie so just try to combine everything now to this we're going to add our white chocolate i'm going to save some for the top okay now use a good quality white chocolate these are carrot shaped okay or chips shaped you can use some good quality bar which you chop up into bite size pieces don't use compound guys okay that's not real chocolate and don't ruin your beautiful cookie with compound if you don't know what the difference is between chocolate and compound i have a great article on my website for it a lot of my students always refer to it so i'm gonna put that in the description box below as well okay this is looking good now i'm gonna add our flour coated strawberries now at this point mix with a very gentle hand okay you don't want to mix it very vigorously because what's going to happen is that it's going to bleed and it's going to become mushy which you don't want at all this is a beautiful sort of fresh cookie all right guys so now what i have here is my baking tray lined with a silicon mat you can use a parchment paper if you want okay and then i have a ice cream scoop here and i'm just going to take some of this cookie dough space it a little bit apart okay this one seems to be a little bit small okay you can weigh these individually if you want if you want them to be perfectly same size and then what you do is i have some water here i'm gonna just dip my hand like so you don't want to wet your hand but just moisten it a little bit and then just form a round shape okay these are chunky beautiful rustic type of cookies so don't expect them to be like absolutely flat okay that's the beauty of it and keep them a little bit apart so that they have space to grow and now what i have here is my chocolate chip i'm just going to place a few on top like so and now what i have here is my strawberry end bits which we are going to place on top like so isn't that beautiful i'm going to continue doing all these and then we are going to bake them look at these beautiful cookies guys we got around 14 cookies you can make more or less according to the size you're going for just make sure that roughly all of these cookies have the same size so they cook evenly in the oven now these are going to go in a preheated oven at 150 degrees celsius for about 30 minutes or so just keep an eye on it you want the top to be slightly golden now we're keeping the temperature a little bit lower usually i bake my cookies at about 180 degrees or so or higher depends on what cookie it is but this is going at 150 because we have fresh fruit in it and we don't want to burn our fresh fruit okay so this is why we're doing this once it comes out of the oven i'll show you what it looks like so while our cookies are in the oven let me quickly remind you that these are made with fresh fruit and whenever cookies are made with fresh fruit you can't keep them for a very long time or outside so store them in the fridge for up to a week and whenever you want to eat nice crunchy cookies you can take them out put them on a baking tray put them in a preheated oven at 150 again just for about five to eight minutes and then that way they'll be refreshed if you're new to the world of baking or pastry or you want to learn more i have an awesome online school we have classes ranging from beginners to intermediate to advanced level most of the classes are egg free or vegan you can check out sprithy special online school the link for which is given in the description box below these cookies came out of the oven at the 30 minute mark and i've let them cool down a little bit they are still warm so there are two things that i want to tell you right now so one is that these are not going to be like super crunchy biscuits these have fresh fruit in them so obviously they're going to be a little bit kind of soft inside which is like the beauty of this okay this has a kind of if you can hear crunchy outside and i'm gonna show you what the inside looks like now this is how i like to eat it slightly warm beautiful and if you can see beautiful look at that beautiful fresh strawberry oozing out this is how i like to eat this i'm going to let it cool down completely so i can show you another kind of texture as it cools it's going to set and get a little more firm but again it's not going to be super crunchy okay so once that happens i'll show you the texture so guys these have cooled down completely and now i'm going to show you another cookie okay now it's still going to be a little bit cakey from the center as i said before but i'm gonna look at this so pretty so pretty i'm gonna chew on one so you can hear can you can you see that hmm can you hear that crunchy on the outside cakey on the inside beautiful fruit now these are my beautiful cookies let me describe it to you this way the the fennel gives a little bit of a floral note and then you have the strawberry which is kind of sweet and tart you have the white chocolate which is obviously sweet it is overall a wholesome cookie it's beautiful you can have it with wine if you want you can have it like when i say with wine i mean like in a cheese board or something you can have it with your coffee or tea or just as a snack and whether you're celebrating we day or not you should make these cookies because they are so good and whenever you do share a picture with me on facebook instagram wherever tag me so i can see your recreations the written recipe for this is given in the description box down below like this video comment on it because i love to see your comments and what you think and what you want to see next from me subscribe to my youtube channel for more delicious recipes i'll see you again next time bye you", "24cwDWF0FUU": "welcome to miele i'm vicki robb and i'm here at our miele experience center in princeton new jersey today we're going to be making a triple chocolate cookie using the combi steam oven on combination mode so if you're looking for a quick easy recipe to use combination mode this will be a great first one to try this is a basic cookie dough recipe but we're making it a little more interesting by using three different types of chocolate chips so we have white chocolate chips we have milk chocolate chips and then we have this dark chocolate chip that actually has some espresso in it so it'll be something that everybody likes but to start we're just going to mix up our dry ingredients in a bowl with a whisk i have some flour and i'm going to add some salt and some baking soda once i have my dry ingredients just whisk together i can put that aside now we're going to start to get our rest of our ingredients together i have two sticks of butter that are softened really nice and soft and i'm going to put those in a bowl of a stand mixer if you don't have a stand mixer you can use a hand mixer or you can even mix it by hand in a bowl i just like the ease of using a stand mixer so i'm going to add two different kinds of sugar i have white granulated sugar and then some light brown sugar and at this time i'm also going to add my vanilla extract so i have all of those in my bowl and i will put that in my stand mixer with the paddle attachment and i'm just going to let this cream until it's creamy and fluffy nice and nice airy texture and that'll be about two to three minutes on a low low to medium speed so we'll come back after we have that mixed together mixer is gone for about two minutes on a medium-low speed my sugar and my butter are really nicely creamed together i'm just gonna scrape it a little bit off of the paddle to make sure there isn't any extra butter that wasn't mixed in i also like to check the bottom of the bowl to make sure i've the paddle has reached the very bottom now i'm going to add two eggs i'm going to put them right in the bowl but if you're more comfortable breaking the eggs into a bowl to make sure you don't have shell go ahead and do that these are large eggs i have them at room temperature so now i'm just going to mix this additionally for not too long maybe just about one more minute to make sure the egg is combined so we have the eggs nicely blended in with the butter and the sugar so now it's time to add our dry ingredients and just add that all in in one [Music] one addition you sometimes see recipes that like you to add it in small amounts but i just add it all at once and then mix it on a low speed to start and then i can gradually raise the speed once it's completely blended which doesn't take long with the flour i'm already there i'm going to stop it and now i'm going to remove the bowl from the stand mixer so just scrape it off your paddle it's so tempting to take a little bit of a taste right now but i promise maybe there'll be a little bit in the bottom of the bowl that you could have a little taste all right so i'm going to put this aside i got most of it off you can you can work on it a little bit longer at home than i did and now we're going to add our chips so it's a total of two cups of chips so i chose to use one full cup of white because i think they'll really stand out and then i'm going to add my half a cup of milk chocolate chips and a half a cup of the dark chips with the espresso flavoring which are so nice and i'm just going to mix this up until everything's nicely blended in and then i chose to use a one and a half inch scoop to scoop the cookie dough onto my universal tray so you can go larger or smaller or even just use a regular teaspoon but i like to use the one and a half inch scoop so i'm going to continue to make sure all my chips are mixed in and then i'm going to scoop them out onto my two universal trays actually i have two and then we'll come back and i'll show you how to program the oven [Music] i actually ended up needing three trays for my cookies so i have two universal trays and my third tray i'm using the mila baking tray so if you're someone that likes to bake cookies using something that has a little less depth you might want to look into purchasing the baking tray which you can find on mila usa.com so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to put that on my third level again for those of you that are new to convection when you're using convection we're having even heat throughout the oven cavity so i can cook three trays of cookies without having to move the trays i'm going to program my oven now and i'm going to turn it on we'll go to operating modes and we're using combination mode so i'm going to use a combination of dry heat with a percentage of moisture it really gives the cookies a very subtly different texture than if you're just using dry heat it's going to have a more even crispiness from the center to the edges of the cookie so i'm going to choose convection bake again i have three trays so i need that even heat on all three levels and i'll set my duration the temperature is 350 i'm going to use 15 minutes because i'm putting it into a cold oven not preheating and i'm going to put the uh moisture level at 30 so i'll select okay finish and okay again and we're gonna start it now and so we'll come back in 15 minutes and i'll show you our finished cookies our 15 minutes of bake time finished and because we added that third tray we're noticing that we actually need a few more minutes so we're gonna go ahead back into the programming and add an additional eight minutes i think somewhere between five and ten minutes we'll do it so i'm going to go for eight so i'm going to select change and i'm going to add a cooking stage so i'll go add convection bake set the duration 350 degrees for eight minutes at 30 moisture once that eight minutes is finished we'll come back and i'll show you the final result our additional eight minutes have finished so it's time to remove the cookies from the oven they came out perfect and so i'm going to remove them from the tray and put them on a cooling rack until they are cool enough to eat or i can store them in a container in the freezer for up to three months and right now what i'd like to show you how to do is how to save the program so you may have noticed once the program's finished there is a save feature on your mail a combi steam oven so when you select save it's going to bring up a keypad and then i can type in chocolate chip cookies so the next time i want to make this recipe i can go into favorites and select chocolate chip cookies and i won't have to worry about the programming it's all saved in your oven so while i type in that and then i have my cookies cooling i hope you enjoyed this recipe and join us again next time", "pHE-bkp3TDE": "I love chocolate-covered treats but I have a little bit of trouble when trying to melt chocolate especially the white chocolate chips so I've invited Jenna to come show us how to melt white chocolate and milk chocolate so that we can make our own homemade chocolate-covered treats welcome to the bear pampas show if you're looking for authentic belizean recipes then you're in the right place my name is Barbara and this is cooking made simple today I wanna show you how to melt some chocolate for your Valentine's Day treats I have some water and it's hidden it's heating up and you get a glass bowl like this so that you don't burn it you don't want to just put it in a pot and just kind of melt it then you put a little bit of easy LLL give that trademark just so it'll melt butter and have like a shiny texture that's what people say so what you want to do is stir it up and let it melt slowly we'll be back when it's already melting so I think this is where I usually go wrong I don't have patience to stay here and just kind of stir this so by the time I walk away and come back my white chocolate is one big hard lump of nothing so I'm taking tips from Jada right here so she's putting a little bit more olive oil so I think she's put like I want to say a couple tablespoons already for the extra virgin olive oil and then she's just stirring and look it's melting into a nice thin liquid that we can drench the stuff that we want to cover in it or we could just dip the stuff in there you know so now let's take care of the milk chocolate so I have some more chocolate chips and we've got a bigger here with a bigger bowl and she's just gonna toss them in enough to know this chocolate because we're gonna dip five items in it she's having a little bit too much fun melting these chocolates for us today guys I noticed that she didn't put as much extra-virgin olive oil in the milk chocolate chips as she did with the white chocolate chips so when it comes to melting chocolate you have to be patient and put enough oil that it will be able to be runny and that we could do stuff in it so alright guys so you see all you'll need is some white chocolate chips some milk chocolate chips if you have dark chocolate that would work too Jayda use some extra virgin olive oil but you can use any vegetable oil that you have on hand melt the chocolates the way Jada showed us then grab your favorite fruit or snack because in the next video Jada is gonna show us how to cover everything in chocolate so we can make something special for our Valentine and we won't even have to wait in the long lines at the candy store thanks for watching the bear pantry show don't forget to

then we will mix all the ingredients really well and now we need to add our dry ingredients which are two cups of flour one teaspoon of baking soda and a half teaspoon of salt and mix all the ingredients really well once it's reach this consistency we could add the chocolate chips after is fully mixed we could form our cookies you can form the cookies into balls and place them on the

guys enjoyed this cookie as much as I do and please subscribe and like and comment below and see you in my next video", "wyuec0PPz68": "so what makes an ideal chocolate-chip cookie what ingredients and what techniques today I'd like to answer that question [Music] explain them very briefly and I'm gonna get right into the first thing is melted butter not cream none of that other [ __ ] melted butter that leads to a chewy cookie the second thing is an added egg yolk the egg yolk adds richness and fudgy Mnet's and now you've got fuzziness and chewiness and then the third thing is to rough chop a chocolate bar rather than using chocolate chips because chocolate chips are complete [ __ ] my opinion you get tiny little bits of chocolate it's it's it's not fun when you chop rough chopped your chocolate you get a beautiful sort of like chocolatey marbled look on the top and then you get random little sporadic bits of just like pure molten melty chocolate in the set I mean come on yeah that's a given if you want to use chocolate chips that's fine I'm not gonna judge you I'm just saying that it's not as good sort of a weird sort of cookie hack that I recently learned called the pan bang method well actually I'll just show you further down in the video because I can't give it all the way gotta get that full YouTube watch time you know understand so I hope you guys will be able to forgive me for that couple day hiatus that I had but I am back we're gonna go ahead and start with 200 grams or wanted a half cups of all-purpose flour three grams or a half a teaspoon of kosher salt four grams or a half a teaspoon of baking soda and then you're just gonna whisk all of that together to combine thoroughly take seven ounces of a dark chocolate bar breaking into large pieces and rough chop that bad boy another term rough-chop comes across little vague so I'll try and explain but you don't want it too small you definitely want it larger than a chocolate chip especially considering all the [ __ ] that I was just talking about chocolate chips next we're gonna take 112 grams or half a cup of unsalted butter and all you got to do is melt it down but don't forget on the stove like I almost did now here I'm using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment but you could totally use a bowl on a whisk a totally fine and you're gonna add in 200 grams or 3/4 of a cup plus 2 tablespoons of packed brown sugar and then 112 grams or half a cup of white granulated sugar start your stand mixer on a low speed to thoroughly combine and add in your melted butter once that's combined your gonna go ahead and add a whole egg increase your speed to medium low and add an egg yolk 6 grams or 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract now I'm very indecisive about my mixer speeds I ended up liking medium fest so you know do that now what's that's done you're gonna go ahead and add in oh oh yeah don't do that anyway add your flour mixture and any remaining flour that you find on the table below to your mixture now a lot of people like to fold in their flour but I just mix it in the stand mixer anyway it's gonna rest so it'll be fine next you're going to fold in all the chocolate chunks that you chopped earlier making sure that they are evenly dispersed next to use the world's most annoying saran wrap to cover your dough and place in the refrigerator for about 30 to 45 minutes to rest and chill or you could do this a day ahead and let it chill overnight up to you now when you're ready to bake you're gonna go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit there are two ways to approach this now the first would be my personal favorite which is to use an ice cream scoop for a cookie scoop to make gigantic cookies now the downside of this method is they will take longer to bake and you're only really gonna be able to fit about four cookies per tray so obviously with that note make sure that you space them far enough apart and then of course the other way would be to use a traditionally sized cookie scoop the choice on that end is completely echt to you but my vote will always go to the now once you've scooped all of your cookies onto a parchment-lined baking sheet you're going to bake them in an oven for 12 to 15 minutes for the large cookies and 8 to 10 minutes for the smaller cookies now here's the interesting tricky hack yep you're just gonna drop the pans it is called the pan bake method I discovered it off of a blog called the vanilla bean now I know it may seem strange at first but it totally makes sense you're basically just going to pick up your pan slightly about an inch and then drop it back down onto the grates you're gonna do that about two to three times the first time after the first six minutes and then the second time about two or three minutes after that the whole purpose of that is it basically interrupts the rise and drops the dough back down pops all the bubbles that the baking soda is developing in there and it ends up making a chewy and more sort of like dense cookie but in a good way totally up to you but it's a really interesting cookie hack that does actually make quite a nice cookie and it gives a cool label of fact on the cookie so now you didn't think I'd skip that b-roll part did you [Music] alright guys and that is it just do it the way that I told you to do it and you will always have beautiful cookies or most the time unless you don't space them far enough apart and they melt into each other and then you sob under your cookies and your cookies are soggy and then that's definitely not something that's happened to me before but anyway as usual if you enjoyed this video please leave like subscribe and hey let me know what kind of recipes you want to see what kind of videos do you want to see what do you want to see what do you want leave comment and let me know but either way I will see you next week [Music]", "MaNJKyoOS_8": "hi I'm Diane cometa and today ondition would die I'm going to show you how to make my homemade chocolate chip cookies light and crisp and load it with chocolate chips so let's get started indicial die this recipe has been a family favorite for years and it's really simple to make I've made it plenty of time right before my son would come home from school the first thing you want to do is get some softened unsalted butter and put that into the bowl of your mixer so I'm using a stand mixer today but you can use a hand mixer for this if you want to now just take that and give it a few spins around to get it nice and smooth now you're going to start adding in some sugar so the first thing is some white granulated sugar and just go ahead and add that in slowly with a mixer on low and then we're going to add in some light brown sugar so just get your measuring cup in there and just pack it down lightly and then go ahead and add that in the combination of sugars is going to give it a really nice texture so the brown sugar is going to give it a little bit of that chewiness and then the white granulated sugar is going to add to that crispness but the brown sugar is also going to add a little bit of flavor because brown sugar has molasses in it so this is the light brown so it's not too strong but it really adds a nice taste to the cookies so now what we're going to do is turn the mixer up in order to clean these two together for about two minutes while that's mixing you want to measure out your flour and you're going to have a separate bowl for this so just go ahead and get your flour and pour it into your measuring cup and then just level it off and then dump it into the separate bowl now we're going to add some leavening to this and that's going to be some baking soda and this is going to add a nice texture to the cookies and help them to be crisp and to rise just a little bit and then you always need some salt salt is going to help bring out the flavors of everything and that's an essential component when you're making cookies or any kind of dish really so now what we're going to do is mix this together and you're going to get as a whisk if it's really thoroughly combined so that everything is distributed evenly just set that aside and our mixture should be creamed pretty well so we're just going to go ahead here and give this a nice scrape down and it's nice and pale and kind of fluffy looking and now we're going to add an egg so I have an egg here and this has been sitting at room temperature for a little while and I'm just going to crack this into a separate bowl and I'm going to add to that some pure vanilla extract and this is really going to make these cookies taste great so pour it into the bowl with the egg and then I just give it like a little whisk to kind of get that combined and then we're going to pour this into our mixture over here so turn the mixer on low and then just gradually pour this in now mix that until it's combined and give that a little scrape down just to make sure everything's mixing well and really go from the bottom and bring it up so you don't miss anything now that that's mixed through we're going to start adding in our flour so with your mixer on low you just want to spoon this in now the dough is mixed through and I'm just scraping down the sides and I'm not going to mix it anymore with the mixer I'm going to stir in my chocolate chips what I have here are some milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips I really like the combination of the two and it does make a difference because I made years and years of chocolate chips with just the semi sweets and then I started mixing in the milk chocolate and it really makes them taste a lot better so just take your spatula and just mix this well until it's combined the chips are mixed through and now I have a small ice cream scoop and I'm scooping the dough onto a parchment lined baking sheet you want to have two baking sheets that are lined with parchment paper and your oven should be preheated to 350 degrees now take the dough and space it about two inches apart so this way when the cookie spread there'll be enough room so they don't run into each other the other important thing is that you do have those two baking sheets because you don't want to take the dough and put it onto a hot baking sheet so when these come out of the oven you're going to switch and have the other baking sheet filled up with dough and put that in so once you get your sheet filled up then you're going to put these into your oven 350 degrees for about 10 minutes or until they become lightly golden brown and then you're going to let them rest on the sheet for about two minutes and then you can remove them onto a rack to cool completely and what's the best way to eat a chocolate chip cookie with some milk mmm crisp delicious in fact I think it could possibly be illegal to eat chocolate chip cookies without milk these are really good you have to try them the recipe is on my website dishing with DICOM and I hope I made your life well more enjoyable and delicious by now you love your cookies don't you you", "MvPdE27Otig": "- Do you love s'mores?\nDo you love cookies? Say hello to my s'mores cookie recipe. These guys are packed with\nmarshmallows, chocolate, graham crackers, and just\nplain amazing flavor. Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cookies will be ready in\na snap, so let's get started. First off, we have a little\nbit of prep work to do. These cookies are gonna\nhave chopped graham crackers for nice crunch inside. I don't wanna use the crumbs because cookies shouldn't\nbe crummy, in my opinion. I'm here all day. Four crackers. If you don't have graham crackers, digestive biscuits, Biscoff cookies, those are all delicious\nand will work well. That's a good old rough chop to me, so let's set these aside in a little bowl. This recipe has one cup\nof mini marshmallows, but here's the deal. Mini marshmallows are small, but they will puff up,\nbecome really gooey. That all sounds delicious, but it might make your cookie go crazy. Rip them in half. If you're opposed to this work, you can dole it out to somebody else, or you can use the marshmallow bits. Marshmallow bits are like the little marshmallows\nyou have in cereal, and you can find them at\na lot of grocery stores, but not all. Rip them up, and I will be saving a couple for the very tops. And now the last bit of prep\nwork is just for our chocolate. I'm using chocolate chips and a Hershey's chocolate bar for this. I think these will look\nreally great on top, strategically placed. But we're gonna give them\na rough chop as well. Basically, I just wanna have\nvisible Hershey's bits here, so people are like, \"Oh, I get it, this is a s'mores cookie.\" That's good, that's one\nsmall bar chopped up. Set it aside, and now we're\non to the dry ingredients, let's get that started. For the dry ingredients I'm adding 1 1/2 cups or 180 grams\nof all-purpose flour to, like, a medium sized bowl. And because I'm me, I'm sifting it out. Exactly 180 grams. Quarter teaspoon of salt, half\na teaspoon of baking powder, and half a teaspoon of baking soda. I'm also adding one full\nteaspoon of cornstarch, aka corn flour in the UK, I believe. This will just make it a little bit more stay-together-y and delicate,\nif that makes sense. Sift it out. Look at this, I found an errant\nlump of some random thing that is not any of the ingredients. That's why I sift. Scale is done, whisk it out, and now we're ready for\nthe butter/sugar situation, let's go. In the bowl of my stand mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, I'm adding 10 tablespoons\nof room temperature butter. This is my new trick for\nmaking things room temperature, when I forget to put\nthem out ahead of time. Okay, that's eight to 10 tablespoons, that is 140 grams if you're counting. Cream it up just a little\nbit to get it started. (mixer whirring) I'm adding in a quarter cup, or 50 grams, of granulated sugar. And now one half of a cup\nof packed brown sugar. Pack it in there. When it comes out, (sugar thuds) that's how it should come\nout, not like sprinkling out, you packed it in. Mix it up. Yeah, and you know,\nscrape, scrape, scrape. Can you tell me, are s'mores\na thing in the US only, or does everyone know about them? Because here it is a very popular thing, but I get a lot of blog comments that graham crackers are\nnot a thing anywhere else. So, like, what are you doing?\nLet me know, I'm very curious. If you please. All right, we're gonna let\nthis go for a couple minutes and just beat it up. We wanna have it be really cohesive and hopefully nice and fluffy. (mixer whirring) That looks pretty good. Crack one egg, room temperature, please. I was not keeping that\nin my kangaroo pouch. All right, now we're going\nto just move everything down. Whenever I have a cookie,\nor any kind of recipe, with butter, brown sugar, and white sugar, I always like to add the white\nsugar first and give it a go. Because if you add the brown sugar in, it just becomes a paste. All right, we're gonna go back to this. (mixer whirring) One teaspoon of a nice\nvanilla extract, 5 mL. Now let's add that egg in. (mixer whirring) This looks bananas, because\nit is not at all mixed. Not at all. This is gonna run until\nit's nice and homogenous, and, yeah, scrape it down. Okay, let's take a look. There you have it, nice,\ncreamy, homogenous, and it's ready for the dry ingredients. Dump your dry mixture in. In you go. I've discovered that the\nkey to not making a mess, which you know I struggle with, is just to give this a\nlittle bit of a headstart, kind of get it premixed before you run it. Now go on low. (mixer whirring slowly) Once it gets to a point\nof being almost combined, we can add in our graham crackers. Mm, crunchy. Three quarters of a\ncup of chocolate chips. And last but not least,\nthose marshmallows. (chuckles) This looks ca-razy in\nthe best way possible. Are you gonna be my dream cookie? Okay, this mixture looks just so good, but do you know what time it is? It's time to chill the dough, because this needs to really firm up, and this is definitely one of the cookies where you want it to be chilled, settled, and ready to go into the oven. Right now, it would just go (puffs). Cover your bowl. Pop it into the fridge to\nchill for at least an hour, and we'll be right back\nwith the magic of editing. Bye bye.\n(glockenspiel glissing) My cookie dough is chilled,\nand it's time to roll it out. Also, set that oven to 350, don't forget to preheat that oven. Look at the inside, that is amazing. I love seeing the marshmallows\nand chocolate chips. All right, so get about two tablespoons, roll it out, and place it, and you can see that there's chocolate chips and\nmarshmallows all in there, and they will be kind of oozing out, so it will be like gooey, ooey. It may be a little bit messy, but sometimes I think it's worth it. Give your cookies a quick\nroll in your clean hands, and place them about two inches apart on that lined baking sheet. I'm using a Silpat,\nwhich is a silicone mat, but you could definitely\nuse parchment paper. Once your cookies are all out, just give them a little bit of a tap down, and then we can decorate them\nwith a few marshmallow pieces, just like you would with\na chocolate chip cookie. Okay, and now we can add our shards of Hershey's\nchocolate onto top. My cookies are loaded\nup with marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers. They're ready for the oven,\n350 for 10 to 12 minutes. The outside will be set,\nthe inside not so much, but it'll continue to set after baking, so don't try and bake\nit all the way through. So I baked the cookies two different ways. The first way, which I\nshowed you on camera, was all assembled with the toppings, they went into the oven\nfor like 10 minutes. But they came out like this. I actually like the way they look, the marshmallows totally melted, the chocolate was distorted,\nbut still visible. However, if you want the\ncookies to really pop, though, bake them for eight minutes\nwithout anything on top, then pull them out of\nthe oven really quickly, pop the chocolate and marshmallows on top, and bake an additional two minutes. You're gonna have cookies\nthat look like this, which is really clear marshmallow and chocolate pieces on top. If you liked this video,\ncheck out my cookie playlist, all my favorite cookies in\none playlist just for you. But now, it's time for a bite. So good! It's basically just chocolate,\nmarshmallow, graham crackers, and a little bit of cookie\nto hold it all together. It is really good, you've\ngotta try this recipe.

"u6T20HEuqxo": "hey guys welcome back to my channel i'm myra from low carb love and today we're going to be making a keto chocolate chip cookie so there are a ton of recipes out there but this one here um does use three different flowers i'm gonna go over everything it's delicious you guys are gonna love it you can make these at home for movie night for you know on the go your choice but anyway we're to go over the the ingredients really quickly and then i'll show you a step by step on how to make it super simple and you guys are going to enjoy so we are using almond flour lupin flour if you guys aren't familiar with lupin flour it is almost like a dusty consistency um it's like a bean and um it is very low in carbs so you know it i love the texture it gives our baked goods then here we have coconut which coconut is also very very very fine and we have our sweetener and i use powdered sweetener which is also very fine like you can see here um if you don't have powdered sweetener you can just throw it through your blender your food processor or even a little coffee grinder um and then we have here a little bit of baking soda we have our chocolate chips so you know that i am obsessed with chalk zero i've been using their products for over two years and love love love so these are dark chocolate but you can use milk chocolate or even white chocolate okay then we have our softened butter and you don't want it completely melted just softened two eggs that are room temperature guys you need to make sure that your ingredients are room temperature so that they all mix in together and you don't end up with um little chunks because that's basically what what it does it makes your food get chunky and then we have a little bit of mayonnaise so that's a little secret ingredient and um yeah let's get started um we're going to mix in all our dry ingredients and then we do have some chalk zero um caramel syrup as well you can use the caramel or the maple and then you can use vanilla extract um right now i told you guys i've been like having this love hate relationship with vanilla extract i don't know why i feel like i can always taste alcohol in it and i'm it's just not viping with me right now so we are using just some vanilla flavor um i do you'll need a little bit more if you're using vanilla flavor versus extract but i love vanilla bean paste uh the thing about vanilla bean paste is that it does have sugar um for me like if i'm making a whipped cream if i'm making an ice cream or like a cheesecake i feel like it's worth the sugar it's not like it's worth it because it's such a small amount but i feel like the vanilla bean gives it such a great taste so for now we have vanilla flavor but i will show you once i get my extract um once i find the one that i'm in love with of course i will share it with you so let's go ahead and start off with our dry ingredients okay okay so let's start off with our almond flour this is one and one fourth cup of almond flour then we have our lupine flour and i will show you here the carbs on this but again they are very low and here we have a quarter cup so a quarter cup of lupin flour then we have a quarter cup of coconut flour we have a third cup of sweetener okay and um lelos does not give you the that cooling effect then we have our baking soda okay and our baking soda is going right in either way i will link the full recipe in the description below um so look for it there's like three little dots you click it and then it shows you everything that i have linked in the description i also have like the syrup where you can use my little discount code um it basically links everything that i use so as well as the recipe okay so um you guys can grab that there and then you're just going to give your dry ingredients a good little mix and now let's go ahead and um let's go ahead and do our wet ingredients okay so for our wet ingredients we are creaming four tablespoons of butter with a quarter cup of powdered sweetener you just want it to get nice and fluffy and after that's done we are going to go ahead and add our two eggs so make sure your eggs are room temperature because it's only gonna help make sure that everything gets well incorporated and doesn't end up chunky okay and if you're using vanilla flavor then you can add one tablespoon if you're using vanilla extract one teaspoon and then here we have our chalk zero syrup and we're using the caramel flavor this adds a little bit of flavor and also helps with the texture so but it is optional so if you don't have it don't worry your cookies will still turn out and now let's make sure we blend everything together i'm using a hand mixer to make sure that we get everything well incorporated and the texture don't be afraid it does get a little separated because of the syrup but trust me when i tell you this everything will turn out fine and now let's mix it up just use your little spatula make sure everything is well incorporated like this you don't have to over mix just incorporate the wet with the dry okay and now we add our chocolate chips so of course i'm using chalk zero chocolate chips i ran out of the milk so we are using the dark but you can use milk dark white whichever you prefer and now we have our baking sheet we're using a sheet of parchment so that it doesn't get you know stuck trying to keep things clean i'm using a little mini ice cream scooper and now we're just going to scoop them up look at how perfect oh my gosh guys i look so professional here and here we are all right guys so here are cookies i have a tiny bit left and i'll probably make like one jumbo but we're gonna put these into the oven make sure of course that your oven has been preheating at 350 degrees we're gonna put these in for i'll show you what they look like at about 10 minutes because all of our ovens are different and um yeah you want to make sure that they are have a little crisp on the outside and they're nice and like chewy on the inside these are not like crispy cookies that will be for another recipe so let's get these in the oven okay so we're gonna do eight to ten we'll check back at eight minutes just because you want to make sure that you don't burn your cookies if you burn them they're going to be extra dry remember we are using coconut flour and you want to make sure that they're nice and moist so always safety first make sure you have your oven mitts let's go okay look at these little babies so this is at 10 minutes okay as you can see they were starting to get nice and toasty at the top we could have probably gotten away with eight to nine minutes so make sure you keep an eye on them when you get them out of you know when they're cooking at least for the first time because then you will know that's your set time okay so our cookies are nice and brown now if you wanted to have your cookies be a little more flat then you just press them down before you bake them but i personally love for them to be kind of uh chewy in the inside well the sun literally looks like red oh my gosh guys i want to show you the sunset okay let's go see the sunset okay okay so that's a beautiful sunset now let's get back to our recipe okay let's go guys and see oh chocolate chip let's see the taste test um these are so good i think after you try these you're never gonna have to buy like another chocolate chocolate chip cookie um very good if you can see it has a nice little crust on the outside and then the inside is nice and moist and you have the chocolate chips this is really delicious um i'm super excited to hear what you guys think make them let me know what you think comment down below your review and of course tag me on instagram so i can share your recreations

but I am always in the mood for a good cookie today's recipe is low-carb sugar-free white chocolate macadamia nut cookies they are so good and so easy anybody can make them so the first thing you're going to do is pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and then line a large baking sheet with parchment paper you definitely want to make sure your baking sheets are always lined when making cookies otherwise your cookies can stick and we don't want sticky cookies next thing you want to do is we're gonna make a brown sugar substitute brown sugar is basically white sugar with molasses added to it I've heard it said that brown sugar is more healthy for you it's not it will do the same thing to your blood sugar that white sugar will do it's not any better for you so this is a good substitute and what it is it's a 1/2 cup of granulated stevia or any type of granulated sweetener that you want as long as it is granulated so you take a half cup of that granulated stevia and add a half tablespoon of molasses get it all in there whisk it together just until the molasses and the stevia is all fully incorporated together you can do this with a small whisk or you can do this with the fork after you're full in with that you're going to set that aside take your mixing bowl take one and a half cups of almond flour 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum this helps keep your cookies together 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt and you're going to whisk this all together just until all the clumps of the almond flour are out because remember I've said before almond flour likes to clump up on you so whisk it together just until all the big clumps are out then you're going to set that bowl aside and you're gonna move on to your standing mixer you're going to add a half cup of granulated stevia or granulated sweetener of your choice then this is where you need your brown sugar substitute and you're going to just push that all in there you need 1/3 cup of softened butter just basically softened at room temperature you don't want it completely melted but you also don't want it hard it's got to be able to mix right so 1/3 cup and whisk this together just until the stevia and the butter are a little bit fluffy they're incorporated together without any big granule put this on well once your stevia and your butter are all incorporated it should just take a few seconds for you shouldn't take a very long time once they're incorporated you're going to add one large egg and 2 teaspoons of vanilla we like our vanilla we want it to taste good then you're going to put this again on low for a few seconds once that's all mixed together then you're going to take the dry ingredients nice and slow there then we're gonna turn this on to loan just until that's fully mixed once that's fully mixed scrape down your paddle if you need to then we're going to put in our add-ins a 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips along with your 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts stir all the way around make sure they get fully incorporated and all the mixture if you don't want to get a cookie that doesn't have any chocolate chips or any macadamia nuts so make sure it's stirred all the way up all throughout the entire dough once that's done then we're going to scoop our cookies onto our lined baking sheet that we already lined earlier and we're going to stoop it I have a cookie scoop it's about one tablespoon at a time you're going to scoop it onto your cookie sheet once you've scooped them onto your baking sheet make sure you space them out by about two inches apart the flour is gluten free so because it's gluten free they will not spread the same way that white flour would white flour cookies they they spread all over the place but gluten free flours they don't do that so basically whatever shape you put these cookies onto your cookie sheet that's what shape they're going to be when you take them out of the oven if you leave them in a ball they're gonna be a ball when you take them out of the oven so if you want them to look more like the traditional cookie shape all you have to do is just smash the tops down just slightly and just shaping around the edges to where they just have the traditional cookie shaped flat disk [Applause] once they're all shaped put them in the oven and bake them for about 15 minutes most of the time alternative flours they take a little bit longer to cook at times because you cook them on a little bit lower temperature than you would regular cookies most of the time cookies that are made with white flour you cook them at around 375 these ones you cook at 350 so about 15 minutes should be perfect once they're baked pop them out of the oven let them sit on the baking sheet for about 3 minutes then transfer them to a wire rack then eat and enjoy oh they smell heavenly mmm so good excuse me while I indulge myself that's it for today hope you enjoyed it if you did remember to hit that like and subscribe button remember once a week I will be posting new videos teaching you how to cook delicious foods without the use of white flour and white sugar so until next week keep cookin [Music]", "nyciBuaIZxs": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie juice gave joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate chocolate chip cookies this is what they look like really what this is is we're making a chocolate chip cookie only we're going to add melted chocolate to the batter and then we're going to also add chocolate chips so we're gonna get a really nice double dose of chocolate so the first thing we need to do is melt some chocolate so you will need a saucepan of simmering water and then in a heatproof Bowl I like to stainless steel you will need 8 ounces 240 grams of a good quality semi-sweet chocolate I like to use a bar of chocolate and then just roughly cut it if you're going to go buy like a lot of times now when you buy bar chocolate there'll be a percentage number on there so I like to use like a chocolate with a 55 to 60 percent cocoa content now I like to use bar chocolate because it melts really nice and smoothly a lot better than chocolate chips but if you want to use chocolate chips I you will need about one and a half cups so I'm just going to put that over simmering water and just let it melt okay our chocolate has now melted so take it off the heat and then what I'm gonna do is just put this aside because we want this to cool down to room temperature and while that's happening pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and then you will need two baking sheets and then just you can line them with parchment paper like I've done here or you could just butter them if you'd like to do that or even spray them with one of those nonstick sprays so I'm just gonna let the chocolate cool and when we come back I will start the batter so now our chocolate has cooled to room temperature so we can make our batter so if you have a stand mixer like I have here use your paddle attachment or could use a hand mixer for this or really you could you've just used a wooden spoon so the first thing you will need is one cup which is 226 grams of butter have that at room temperature I prefer unsalted butter I like the flavor better but you could use salted here if you'd like and so what I'm going to do first is just beat this until the butter gets nice and smooth okay it's good and as always scrape down the bottom and the sides of your bowl as much as you need to to make sure everything gets all mixed together so next we're going to add a half a cup about 105 grams of firmly packed light brown sugar and as you know brown sugar tends to have lumps so you know there's some large ones you might want to just run your fingers through them to get rid of any of those and then also you want a half a cup a hundred grams of granulated white sugar and then I'm just going to beat this on medium high speed for a couple minutes one see a little bit of air to get into the batter so until it's nice and light and fluffy okay looks good so this is what you're looking for you can see this just want to get some air in there so I'm just going to leave this out so now what I'm gonna do is add our melted and cooled chocolate you wouldn't want that you you need to cool down your chocolate because you don't want to add like warm chocolate to your batter you'll start melting the batter which we don't want [Music] so now I'm just going to beat that in along with one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract try to use a pure better flavour to speak that in hey it looks good so now what we're going to do is add two large eggs one at a time beat one in and then beat the second and make sure your eggs are also at room temperature okay looks so beautiful just give it a good stir so now in the separate bowl I have two cups that's 260 grams of all-purpose flour you may know that as a plain flour and to that I'm going to add a half a teaspoon of salt now if you use salted butter I would probably just leave that salt out and then I'm also adding one teaspoon of baking soda so the baking soda is used for leavening but it's also when you use it in cookies it produces a cookie with like nice crisp edges which is perfect on the chocolate chip cookie so so now what I'm going to do is add the flour mixture and then I'm also going to add because we are making a chocolate chip cookie I'm going to add one cup 170 grams of chocolate chips now you don't have to just use dark chocolate chips which I am using a semi-sweet but I'm also using some white chocolate chips so I'm using actually half a cup of each you could also use milk chocolate chips really anything mix what use one uses a variety whatever you like kind of like the white chocolate chips because they really show up with the dark colored cookies so now I'm just going to beat this in just until everything's mixed together [Music] looks good so if you found I'm going to this my batter looks pretty thick so I'm going to bake the cookies off right away if you found your batter is a little soft then you could just cover and put it in the refrigerator for a half hour an hour until it's firm enough or actually you don't have to bake all these cookies off the day you make the batter you could keep the batter in the fridge for a day or two because you know this is quite a bit of batter you might if you like freshly baked cookies then might want to save some of the batter for tomorrow so now I like large cookies so I'm using I'm actually using an ice cream scoop but you could use just a quarter cup measuring cup 60 milliliters and form your cookies because I like to use about a quarter of a cup nice large cookies and if you want away you could also weigh it it's about 60 grams of batter for each cookie or two ounces now you could make them smaller if you want I mean you don't have to make them large so now because they do spread you only want to put about six cookies per baking sheet and six so now what I want to do is just flatten these just a little so I just have a little bit of water here and then I'm just going to put on your fingertips and and just slightly flatten them so you don't have that dome shape so now we're going to bake these now like I always say everybody's ovens a little different and the other thing is with chocolate cookies as you may know they are really hard you can't it's hard to tell when they're done so what you are looking for is the outside edges will be set but the end like the center of the cookies will be really soft so I find this size cookie in my oven somewhere between 14 and 16 minutes and I do like to rotate my pan front to back about half way through baking okay our chocolate chocolate-chip cookies are done don't they look gorgeous nice big cookies now this is what you're looking for the outside like I can I can feel it's set like but inside here I don't know whether you can tell it is really quite soft now that's if you want like a crisp you want the cookie depth crisp edges like kind of a soft and chewy centers of course some more you bake them the more crisp they will be so I guess it's about personal preference here so now these are really soft so I'm just going to let them cool in the pan on the wire rack for maybe five minutes and then after that they'll be set up enough that I can transfer them over to or big error wire rack to finish cooling so that's when I'm gonna bake another sheet off and when we come back we will try one okay so now we'll just transfer them over to like so and then let's try what don't they look gorgeous he's still night it's still a little warm so it's nice and soft I don't know whether you can see that really nice inside oh that's sir you like chocolate good cookie um wonderfully crisp crisp add just really nice and soft I mean with the chocolate in the cookie and then chocolate chips really good tasting cookie so of course really good the first day they're made but you can cover and store them for a few days and they can be frozen so enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm [Music]", "ck9X_zOl7Lk": "these cookies are green with Matra matcha is a powder made from premium green tea leaves and not only gives a beautiful shade to these sweet cookies but also lends some of the benefits of green tea so you can finally say that eating a cookie is good for you and it'll be true we'll get started by preheating the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit then grease baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray or a line with parchment paper now let's sift together 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of green tea powder 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into a bowl in a separate bowl add one cup of packed brown sugar 1/2 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cups of melted unsalted butter beat together with a handheld mixer to combine next add 1 tbsp of vanilla extract one whole egg and one egg yolk continue to beat with a mixer until light and creamy let's fold in the dry ingredients just until blended and stir in one and a half cups of white chocolate chips drop the cookie dough by heaping tablespoonful x' spacing them two to three inches apart and bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned let these cool for 2 to 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely the cookies a lovely green in color are an ideal partner to a glass of milk or a steaming cup of green tea you might even say a matcha made in heaven if you have any leftover try using them to make ice cream sandwiches with green tea ice cream you", "MTD-O-Q466Y": "hey everybody welcome back to my bake like a pro YouTube channel in today's really fun video we are gonna make some amazing chocolate chip cookies for our recipe today we need 1 cup of salted butter 227 grams half a cup of white granulated sugar 100 grams 2 cups of chocolate chips 400 grams and I am using semi-sweet chocolate in my recipe today 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract 10 grams 1 teaspoon of salt 5 grams 1 teaspoon of baking soda 5 grams 1 cup of brown sugar 233 grams we also need two and a half cups of all-purpose flour 375 grams all purpose flour is also called plain flour in many countries so those are the ingredients so let's get started for our first step all of our butter into our bowl and I am using salted butter but I'm also adding a little bit extra salt because I do like my chocolate chip cookies a little bit more on the salty side all of our granulated white sugar and our brown sugar and I'm using a lighter brown sugar but you can use a darker brown sugar if you wish and also note that whatever you were measuring brown sugar make sure to pack it into your little measuring cup so now we'll just mix this up speed number one always start off at speed number one when you start your machine because you don't want everything flying out of your bowl [Applause] so at this point what we want to do is get all of our stuff well combined and well creamed [Applause] so that's about two minutes of creaming and then we will add in our eggs you can add them in one at a time or at the same time it doesn't really matter and there's our two eggs then we'll incorporate that and what this is going to do it's going to loosen this whole mixture and it's gonna make it that much more creamy so that's a good minute of mixing on a higher speed and you can see how nice and creamy our mixture is I'm gonna add in my pure vanilla extract I'm just gonna give that a little mix it's good so now what we're gonna do is switch over to the dry ingredients so to our all-purpose flour which is also called plain flour we're gonna add in our salt and our baking soda just mix that around and then we're gonna add in all of our mixture and now speed number one and let's mix this in [Applause] so this is about 30 seconds of mixing I'll just turn that off lift it up at our last ingredient all of those chocolate chips and I am using semi-sweet chocolate chips you can use any type of chocolate chip that you wish if you don't have chocolate chips you can take a chocolate bar and just shave it into little pieces and then pop that in and the amount of chocolate doesn't matter either it doesn't have to be accurate as I did in my recipe here you can put whatever amount that you like into your cookies close this down speed number one so just keep your mixer going until it looks well incorporated and that's it for the recipe I wanted to just show you how nice this dough is this is really really nice dough so we're just gonna scoop this up so what I do is I scoop it up and I push it against the side here just push it and then scoop it right out look at that nice get nice and round that looks good and just continue on you don't want to have these too close together that looks nice I think for this recipe I am going to use another size scoop as well just to see the comparison I'll just give you a little difference between smaller cookies and larger cookies well that dough sells amazing okay that's perfect for the first tray so you can see I've arranged them so that they don't melt into each other I'm gonna pop these now into my 375 degree fahrenheit oven I'll bake these off I'm going to do another batch with a slightly larger scoop and we'll see how those are so off to the oven and I'll be back in a little while for my next batch I'm gonna try out a slightly larger ice cream scoop or a cookie scoop and we'll try this out just for comparison you can see much larger so my oven will stay the same 375 degrees Fahrenheit I'm gonna leave a lot of room and hopefully I will remember to weight each cookie because I know a lot of people like to know the weight of the dough ball so there we go that looks good so I'll go bake these and I'll come back when everything is baked hey everybody I am back I have finished all of my baking so let's quickly go through what we did number one on the plate I have two samples I have the larger scoop here which is a total of 80 grams and the small scoop is a total of 30 grams so 30 and 80 so we have a difference of 50 grams and you can see that this one here is substantially larger than the small one for the small scoop we have 16 cookies here plus one here is a total of 17 and then we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 here 7 8 9 10 so a total of 10 here Plus that one 11 for the large scoop for a little bit of a variation I took the same scoop which is this one here so this one here created all of these and also this so before I put these into the oven I just press down the cookie dough so you can see that it's rounded I pushed it all down and you can see the difference I'll just lift this up so you can see so there we have the one that I pushed out and we have that there and both of these were created from the larger one here and the last bit of important information all of the small cookies were baked for a total of 10 minutes these ones here were at 12 minutes because they are thicker and then because I press these ones out I only did these for 11 minutes so I'll take these these are

Today I am going to show you how to make Chocolate\nChip Cookies, mmm yummy, these chocolate chip cookies are soft, chewy, super yummy, really\neasy to make, chocolate chip cookies are my favorite cookie to make and eat. What is your favorite cookie? Drop a comment down below and let me know. Let's get started. First preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Then\nwe start with 1 cup of softened butter, 1 half cup of white granulated sugar, 1 cup\nof packed brown sugar, okay now using a hand mixer or stand mixer, let's cream this all\ntogether, once it is creamed together let's go ahead and scrape down the sides, at this\npoint we are going to add our eggs, one at a time, first large egg, now let's add two\nteaspoons of vanilla extract, now we take 2 and a half cups of all purpose flour, we\nwill add one tsp. of baking soda, on half tsp. of salt. Then we will go ahead and use a whisk or you\ncan sift it together, and we will mix it all together. All right now let's take our flour and we\nare going to just add about a third of it at a time, mix, alright add some more flour,\nnow we want to scrape the sides as needed, add more flour, and then before I add the\nrest of the flour, at this step I am going to add 2 cups of chocolate chips, these are\nsemi-sweet, you can you use milk chocolate as well, this equals about one package here\nin the States, I am going to mix those in. Okay, and then let's add the rest of our flour,\nthen one last scraping of the sides. Alright our cookie dough is done, and now\nwhat we are going to do is we need to separate our beaters and now time to clean off those\nbeaters, and then you can just use your spatula, come in here and push them out. Alright once our cookie dough is done, it\nis time to form our cookies, I am using a cookie sheet with an Artisan Mat on top, this\nis a Silicone baking mat, really awesome, really love these silicon baking mats, they\nclean really easy, they last a really long time, they help to keep the cookies from getting\nburnt on the bottom, and uh, if you want to pick a couple of these up, I will put a link\ndown below where you can get them, really awesome, I highly recommend them especially\nfor cookies. So what we do is we take a spoon or ice cream\nscoop and we take some cookie dough, it's about 2 tablespoons worth, and go ahead and\ndrop it on there, and you can form it a little bit, with your hand if you want, just like\nthat, whatever side you want to make, big ones, little ones, whatever you want to make,\nabout an inch and a half apart. All right and then you bake these in the oven\nat 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of the cookie, if you make them\nbigger, bake them a little longer, smaller a little shorter, until the edges are just\nslightly brown. All right so we cook them until the edges\nare just slightly brown right there, and then you take them out of the oven and let them\nsit on the cookie sheet, for about 5 minutes to cool before transferring them to a cookie\nrack to cool the rest of the way. Alright I am going to show you the bottom\nof this cookie, look at that, nice golden brown, pretty awesome. All right our chocolate chip cookies are done,\nthey turned out amazing, super soft and chewy, mmm delicious, this recipe makes 2.5 to 3\ndozen chocolate chip cookies, depending on the size, they are really easy to make, if\nI can do it, you can do it. I am Matt Taylor this has been another episode\nof In the Kitchen with Matt, thank you for joining me, as always, if you have any questions\nor comments put them down below and I will get back to you as soon as I can, Thumbs up,\ndown in the corner, push it, Don't forget to subscribe to my channel, take care. Time for me to dive into one of these, oh\nyeah, my favorite part of the show, I am going to grab this guy right here, mmm, mmm, mmm", "3eCq2xNI95k": "hello everyone and welcome back to crumbs and doilies HQ and middle of V January I hope you've been enjoying all the vegan baking and I hope you've been doing a lot I've seen lots of your work on Instagram so well done this recipe is an absolute brillo pads recipe it is so so good if you just recently turned vegan and one of the things you're missing the most is a good chewy chocolate chip cookie then this is your lucky day because this is a vegan chocolate chip cookie and it is so delicious the first thing I'm going to do is to mix my dry ingredients together just sifting them into a bowl so I've got some plain flour here there's 300 grams of that I've also got a teaspoon of baking powder and I've got 3/4 of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and half a teaspoon of salt so just shuffle that all through so once that's all through you can put that to one side and now I'm going to mix my wet ingredients sort off because I've got some wet ingredients and my sugar so I've got a hundred grams each of caster sugar and light brown sugar going into my bowl and also I have 120 milliliters of oil and I also have 75 milliliters of water and also put a teaspoon of vanilla extract in there and then give it a good whisk so once that's all combined you don't have to risk it for too long you then need to put your dry ingredients in with your wet ingredients and give it a really good mix now once it's all combined you don't want to go crazy whisking it and then that it's pretty much ready now you'll notice it is a very strange consistency not the kind of consistency that you normally associate with cookie dough don't worry that is how it's supposed to be it's just a little bit odd but you need to wrap this in cling film put it into the fridge for overnight and then come back to in the morning right so I've just chopped up some chocolate chips just so that they're ready to go and my cookie dough which has been sitting in the fridge overnight and is firmer a lot of Fermin than it was yesterday is ready to be molded into lovely balls of yummy cookie dough so I've got my scales here because I like to be precise and I'm going to weigh my balls 40 grams each [Music] now you want to put your rolled cookie dough balls into the fridge or the freezer before you bake them but before you do obviously you're probably wondering where the chocolate chips are going to go well they're going to go all the way around the outside around the outside right so I'm just going to roll them in white chocolate chips and then put them into my trade [Music] I've always preferred using chocolate chip as in a chocolate bar chipped up by my own fur hand for chocolate chip cookies just because you then get little pieces and big piece it's a little bit more irregular rather than using like pre-made chocolate chips and obviously don't forget to make sure that your chocolate is vegan otherwise these ain't gonna be vegans [Music] so this recipe makes about 12 cookies if you don't want to make all your 12 cookies then you roll them into balls and put them in the freezer for just cover them for them in the freezer and then bake them whenever you like but for now just put your tray or cookies into the freezer for about 10 minutes just to firm up a bit so these have been in the freezer for about 10 minutes and that will just help them to stop spreading way too much but for now you want to put these onto a baking sheet lined with paper and you want to spread them out quite far apart just in case they do spread [Music] and then you just want to bake these at 170 degrees C for 12 to 15 minutes and they want to be lightly golden around the outside but it's still a little bit poofy in the middle [Music] [Music] [Music] mmm-hmm how about them they look just like real chocolate chip cookies right but they're vegan so technically they're still real and they are absolutely delicious and if you eat them in a minute like I'm about to do they'll stay all warm and gooey and they're just so delicious and I can't wait these even so please give them a go take a picture put on Instagram use hashtag cupcake Gemma make sure I see it maybe I'll even feature you on mega fan Monday if I like your picture enough but the main thing is that you just make them and then obviously eat them because they are so so good so I hope you've enjoyed all the vegan treats I've had for you this January it's vegan you let me know how you get on in the comments box below and I will be back next week [Music] Yama's seriously yes it's so dude everything is falling apart it's like an earthquake", "HmqgsTz18ZI": "hi guys and learn Vitaly and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how I make my coconut chocolate chip cookies they're incredibly easy to do but I kind of came up with this recipe last minute a few weeks ago actually two weeks ago and I made them quite a few times since since everybody really enjoyed them so I figured I love you guys and I want to share the recipe so let's get to it but before we do that let's go to the ingredients you'll need some unsalted butter in a little bit of vegetable shortening both have been softened at room temperature all-purpose flour salt baking powder baking soda brown sugar plain old regular granulated sugar shredded coconut semi-sweet chocolate chips an egg and vanilla extract that is it my friend the ingredients are really simple now basically this is like my classic chocolate chip cookie recipe that I made here in Laura in the kitchen actually a few years ago um and I that sites like my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookie because everybody loves it and then a couple weeks ago I was getting ready to leave for Florida if you follow me in Facebook you already know this and I was making a batch for my coworkers and I didn't have enough chocolate chips but I had a little bit of coconut leftover so I figured combine the two and they love these so much this will be my fourth time making them so that tells you something they're pretty darn good now the first thing you want to do is get your oven preheated to 375 get a couple of baking sheets with some parchment paper ready in handy because these are going to go so fast within 20 minutes from here till about 20 minutes um now they'll be done so I'm going to make these in my standing mixer just because it's easy will being a little bit lazy today I'm going to put in my butter and shortening now if you don't have vegetable shortening just substitute it with a little bit more butter the equivalent of the shortening you would use butter I like the shortening it gives you a little bit more of a delicate texture on the cookie I always use it people love it if it ain't broke why fix it you know what I mean so now to the butter and shortening I'm going to add both kinds of sugar and I'm going to cream this together pretty well until they're all really nice and combined that looks good enough as always you want to take a spatula just run it along the sides because you want that all to get mixed all right now I'm going to add in one egg and some vanilla extract now if you want this this cookie to be like really coconutty forget the vanilla extract substitute just a little bit of 1/4 teaspoon of coconut extract that will really bring out the flavor of the coconut I tried it's a little too strong for my liking I like the subtle sort of warm toasted coconut II that comes through in the chocolate so I think it's a perfect balance this way but hey you know you don't know unless you try it so if you really like coconut quite a bit like you really like that strong taste do do try it cuz I think that's you know you only want to know whether you like it or not just going to mix this together and then in the meantime I'm just going to take my dry ingredients which is just my flour salt baking powder baking soda yeah that's just a quick little mix and now because this is a cookie not a muffin or a cake or anything like that I don't need to toss my flour with the chocolate chip cookies because it's just gonna bake evenly it's not like it's a cake batter where the chocolate chips are going to sink all the way to the bottom so I'm eliminating that step and just gonna wait for this to get combined a little bit more and we'll be ready to add in our dry mixture that looks great let's add in our dry mixture I'm just gonna mix this just enough until they're all combined good enough for me all right let's add in the coconut and the top of chips now have a quick question this is gonna sound really awkward but is it just me or does coconut remind you like summer and tropics and beach weather and all things fabulous I don't know why any time I eat anything with coconut in it that's what I think of I think right now I'm just craving spring and summer so badly that I'm finding any excuse to feel like it's right around the corner even if I just have to bake with coconut I love everything about spring and summer and I want to know what you love about spring and summer most for me obviously most of the time the best part of any season is the cooking you know I'm saying full-time pumpkin cinnamon all those warm spices summertime fruits vegetables the grill I love fighting up that grill and getting it ready for some good steaks and chicken and veggies and oh so let me know what you're most looking forward to because if it has anything to do with food I want to make it so ok enough chit chatting getting this dough off for this hook I want to get as much of it as possible off of there you don't want to waste a thing yeah it's looking good all right now you know the trick handy-dandy ice cream scoop a 1 this is a 1 tablespoon measuring ice cream scoop so if you don't have an ice cream scoop just take two spoons make little balls put them on your baking sheet good to go same thing this just makes my life a lot easier take little mounds of it plop it right on allow a couple inches apart from each other because these will spread out and they bake and then just keep on rolling let's do one more now there's this dough mix you know more cookies that I'm gonna bake obviously but I have to tell you if you've been following me here and Laura in the kitchen and you know anytime I make cookies I always have extra batter that I save I plop it all on a ziploc bag stick in the freezer then I take the whole thing when I'm ready to bake them in the microwave for 30 seconds cause it perfectly plump it on the baking sheet in the oven homemade fresh cookies for any time someone stops by and I tell you if your friends love you now wait until you see how much they love you when they show up I noticed without announced and you can get homemade cookies on the table in about 15 minutes that's pretty impressive all right these are going to go into your preheated oven at 375 about nine to eleven minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown let them cool completely but rotate the baking sheets halfway through for even baking I'm gonna show you what they look like when they're done my cook these four in the oven for 11 minutes and I just rotated the cooking sheets with baking sheets halfway through and they're exactly how they should be I let these cool for a bit now don't think that that little tiny bit of shortening may be super crunchy because what these are are perfectly chewy and delicious it's just somehow that little tiny bit of shortening makes that cooking just a little bit lighter in texture and the coconut is just subtle enough to make its presence but it doesn't take over which is what I love about it I really do love coconut like a lot mmm all right I'm gonna have to wrap this up because I got to wrap these babies up and take them to my co-workers tomorrow morning before I keep eating them and they'll be not left for the Hema I hope you enjoyed spending time with me get this quick and easy recipe Laura in the kitchen calm like all my other recipes if you enjoy spending time with me in su next time you", "OwTIdxWcktc": "Well, with the holiday season upon us, lots\nof people head into the kitchen, they bake cookies, they bake cakes, they bake all kinds\nof things. And this is what those companies who sell\nthings like marshmallows or chocolate chips or whatever it is live for. But unfortunately, according to a new class\naction lawsuit, one company is selling a form of white chocolate chips that may not be chocolate\nat all. Joining me now to talk about this is Scott\nHardy with Top Class Actions and Scott as somebody who watches food network pretty much\nnonstop, white chocolate is technically not chocolate because it does not contain any\nof the cocoa solids, but white chocolate is in fact a thing. But this lawsuit against Ghirardelli says,\nokay, we understand white chocolate's not necessarily chocolate by definition, but you're\nnot even giving us white chocolate. You're giving us a bunch of things that you\nconcocted in a lab and you're calling that white chocolate. This is, you know, pretty deceptive of a company\nthat's been around for a long time, you know, pretty well respected in the candy world and\nso tell us what's going on now. Yeah. Ghirardelli, I mean, you go to their, their\nfactory, their store when you're in San Francisco, they make delicious chocolates. I myself am a fan, but then you have this\nclass action that was filed because as you said, white chocolate, yes, it's not real\nchocolate. But what they're doing here is they're just\nadding flavors to their hydrogen, hydrogenated and palm oils, hydrogenated oil and palm oil\nand then coloring and selling this stuff as white chocolate chips. And that's the issue. But the, the funny thing is, is that they\nwere hit with a class action and settled it back in 2014. Back in 2014 it was a very, very, very similar\nclass action settlement. And so we're trying to take a look at this\nand say, what, did Ghirardelli just forget? Were they acquired, so then the new acquisition\nmade that they didn't have to abide by the terms of the class action settlement from\n2014? Did those terms expire and so Ghirardelli\njust went back to marketing it in the same way? I'm not quite certain yet. The team's looking at both class actions to\nsee exactly what's happening. But it's surprising that you have an established\nbrand that's trusted and loved like Ghirardelli, come back and get hit with a class action\nthat they already settled five years ago. You know, and again, this is a trusted company. You know, Ghirardelli is known for chocolate. That is what they do. And so if you're out there baking, you want\nto have the best thing possible. So you do reach for these, you know, Ghirardelli\nwhite chocolate chips. You pay a little bit more for them, but you\nthink you're getting a better product and that, you know, is something we talk about\nall the time. You pay a little more because you think you're\ngetting something a little bit better. But as this lawsuit states, you're not using\nany of the cocoa fats, which is what makes it actually white chocolate. Instead, you're using the other oils that\nyou're just mixing together and claiming that this is white chocolate. You've somehow managed in a lab to mimic the\nflavor of it to an extent. They're also claiming it's obviously quite\ninferior to real white chocolate, so they've got a good case because this one's going to\ncome down to science. You know, you're going to be able to look\nat this, you're going to be able to test this. They're going to be able to find out what's\nactually in there and again, knowing that they have, as you pointed out, done this in\nthe past, their own history is working against them on this one. It really is, I mean you got hit with it five\nyears ago, oh, please just do the right thing. Maybe put the premium ingredients that we\nexpect from Ghirardelli in your chocolate. Because if you're looking at, in the grocery\nstore and you're making a yummy Christmas treat or Hanukkah treat or holiday treat for\nyour family and you're taking a look there and you see the Ghirardelli brand and you\nsee the generic brand, the store brand, well of course you're going to go for the Ghirardelli\nbrand. But it'd be crazy if that store brand actually\nhas the premium ingredients that you were expecting in that Ghirardelli chocolate. So I'm hoping that they go ahead and address\nthe labeling or even better, just go for the premium stuff. Give us that premium Ghirardelli taste that\nwe love when we go to Ghirardelli square in San Francisco and, and eat that chocolate. Right, I mean, the consumers are already paying\nfor the superior product, so all you've got to do is actually give us what we're paying\nfor and we're going to be happy. But at the same time, obviously with this\nlawsuit, you need to go ahead and compensate us in some form for the inferior product that\nyou duped us into buying. For more information about this particular\nissue, please follow the link in the description of this video. It's going to take you over to Top Class Actions\nand while you're there, make sure you sign up for their weekly newsletter. Scott Hardy with Top Class Actions, always\na pleasure talking to you. Great talking to you too, Farron. Thank you.", "4TztsTYyQwY": "hello friends today we're making right chocolate cookies and here's how we did it yeah now the first thing we did was that we the next job is to get together all the ingredients and we have put the oven on at 180 degrees first to measure out 125 grams of butter and it needs to be softened so it can either be left out of the fridge or we softened it in the microwave for about 15 seconds then you add to that 80 grams of brown sugar how much have you got Emily 206 good do you need more yeah keep going now Emily is adding 75 grams of caster sugar next we need to mix it together go go go Emily then we add a beaten egg and we mix it we have four oh yeah we beat it up with a fork then we mix mix mix and we add one teaspoon of vanilla yeah mix mix mix we creamy ready that's going in as well right we then add two teaspoons of baking powder gonna add that first can't see you behind the top so that's two teaspoons of baking powder come in and we're gonna put the bowl back on the scale yeah and measure out 225 grams of plain flour so now emily is mixing in the 225 grams of plain flour into the mix so now we've mixed that in it should look something like this we are then gonna cut up some white chocolate so you've got some powers of [Music] rather than flying chocolate as chocolate chips we've got bars of chocolate which we're gonna cut up and do really chunky please so now we've cut up the chocolate and we're gonna mix it all in but it's really hard to mix isn't it yeah really hard job it's funny because she seemed to have chocolate on your lips darling [Music] so all ends up eat and then we little blobs of the mixture onto a baking sheet we like to use about a walnut size but quite generous size onto the cooking sheet and bake them in the oven for 10 minutes all right so now emily has got all of the cookies set out in the tray and from that amount of mixture we've got 16 cookies so now they're going in the oven so these have been in the oven for 10 minutes I've just got them out what do you think Emily amazing that's gorgeous they're still soft and chewy at the moment so we're gonna let them cool down we've got yeah we're just gonna get them out away yeah so this is our final product these were white chocolate chip cookies and they are yummy and chewy should we try one to try one and break one open and try it they're really really delicious oh they're really soft and still chewy and they've just come out of the oven cool yeah if you liked this video then give us a thumbs up subscribe and we'll see you next time see you

to click reading back to the click baby back to you John it back to you Emma okay click beating okay so oh yes we are going to be testing cupcake Gemma's raspberry white chocolate cookies but I'm sorry I do not have Asperger's but actually potatoes potato potato hey that's not right this recipe just like your other one requires caramelized white chocolate as you can see here we have the finest ingredients we have the signature select a generic brand this is gonna take a while so bear with me please it's a minute 13 if this expedition I'm trying to get anyways this is taking a long time which I knew it would but I didn't think it would take this long and it's it's taking a while so you might be wondering what this is and this yes is my caramelized white chocolate it's hardening right now see but uh yeah well there's my chocolate is freaking good it's really delicious not to let me tell you it takes a long time to make I guess there's a way to make in the oven which I would recommend doing in the microwave takes so long with my friends getting a little agitated because honest to god it took me like 30 to 40 minutes to do it I'm just warning you you got to commit to the recipe which I'm pretty sure I said that same joke in my last video so I guess I need to work my metier a little bit but for the New York City cookies it's always a little different than making normal cookies you first mix the butter but you're not gonna steam it little bells up you're not trying to creaming it you're just trying to give a little a tender touch and just break it up a little that's right [Music] hey you know what it's not gonna work like this this time we're gonna do something a little different and some people might not like it's gonna be little controversial the guy that video said that he had some friends you had no mixers and they just use their hands and it worked out fine so I think when we use my hands which I know how to disturb some people but we go and do it the butter is gently broken up now we're gonna add in the two sugars I have to mix together it's just white and brown sugar so I'm gonna try it with a spoon the knife I have to get there in my hands I might now you're supposed to make little nuggets with the sugar so again the cue of these recipes is not over mixing them we're just kind of like getting everything just there but not quite there okay guys I'm going in with the hand so if you're squeamish we believe building those muscles working out we got our nuggets what do you think okay so the next thing is the chocolate now for my chocolates the last time somebody jump up she goes raining good cover anyway and she's handsome now we need to add a nice special caramel and chocolate let's see it's actually done I'll be right over here hold on mmm it smells good I never I haven't tried a piece yet mmm Thomas I'm afraid nothing like little little Chomp Chomp ears and stick them in oh I think it looks pretty thing good now we're just gonna mix that all together I think next week baggie so cool let me try no we need to add in the strawberries hmm I haven't had fusion fruit and so long lesson right now fries I appreciate fruit there's some a lot of water and freeze-dried fruit than drive-thru face our crew and all the same things free shampoo is great for baking laughs but is very powdery you can use the powder to flavor things like promise they're young go ahead and tell your pet cat those interesting facts fetish or anything else good oh this is gonna be perfect we have quarantine you're beautiful oh my gosh this is butter and sugar and chocolate I love it we're just gonna add the flour and there's also baking powder in here I'm just gonna put a little in at first and then mix that around and then add the rest everything is looking crumbly and good it has like the big chunks like they do I think we're on the right track now the last ingredient are two eggs which they recommend can't say can tell you are and that's the last thing so away yes this is the final mix so it was all done guys now we need to roll these into larger balls put them in the freezer and then we're gonna bake some tonight it's like too much appealing making them into balls but here they are they're looking good I'm gonna put them in the freezer so there's no more time wasting on their to our town down to medium guys look at the aftermath of this this is not good I don't know why today turned out being so messy no don't look at the ground I don't know and I'm really just not feeling the cleanup today sad got the oven preheated we're gonna pop them in the oven I forgot to put the training you're supposed to put the train that I've been like a little before to heat it up I forgot anyway so I'm gonna put them in for 14 minutes the ovens at w55 it's supposed to be it's like 180 degrees Celsius which I think of birds like 356 or something weird bird honey so I'm putting it there do you got it so let's go okay guys they're coming go ahead ready here are the cookies these things turned out really nice and shaped look how thick that is geez didn't really flattened so I had to manually manually flatten these things out and it worked fine I mean like you can see here a little damaged ice hut here's a little damage and see where I put the spatula on there see that but it worked out in the end I'm very interested to see how they taste and what they look like on the inside because why wouldn't I be right that's what we're here for it's so hot Oh oh my gosh could you see the steam coming out dang it I don't see any the caramelized chocolate I think it's cooled out enough to try so let's try it mm I good good strawberry flavor II thought overwhelming I feel like the cookie could be moister though it is moist it's not dry I might have over baked them I mean I have more I saved six in the freezer that I can't again and try and see I mean it really does just taste like a strawberry shortcake but not as honest biscuit make sense I think it's a really nice summer cookie it's fun it's a unique I've never had a cookie like this I don't believe I only is so sweet raspberry I totally forgot if they were raspberry I don't know if would make that much of a difference leave your thoughts in the comments below because I am torn on the Hat so overall it's a pretty good cookie I mean I'm definitely gonna enjoy eating them okay cool so that wraps up another taste testing video and let's untie something else what was it on that now I'll be wrapping a good day I will see you another video that means peace bye", "z-0JaLfXJlE": "hey it's Lisa and it's been a while since I've done a cooking video but we have a ton of the jello mix and the jell-o pudding so we're gonna try a lemon pudding white chocolate chip cookie I've never made cookies with pudding mix before so hopefully they come out good and today we have chef Sean so he's gonna be the chef today since I don't like being on camera but he's gonna help us out and make the cookies with us as well as of course being the tester as always so let's first talk about the ingredients we have 2 eggs 1 cup of butter it has to be room temperature 2 and 1/4 cups of flour 2/3 of a cup of sugar a cup and a half of white chocolate chips 2 tablespoons of lemon juice it's a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of salt is in there and then we have 1 box of the jello lemon flavor pudding this is the four and a half cup serving size it's the 3.4 ounce box [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] now that the batter is done you're going to line a pan with parchment paper and we're making about one-inch sized cookie drops and they're going to go into the oven at 350 degrees for 8 minutes while the cookies are baking you can put together a quick glaze it's a cup of powdered sugar one and a half tablespoons of lemon juice and you have the option of adding a little lemon zest if you'd like we gave the cookies an extra minute we took them out at nine minutes they looked a little underdone but after they sat for a few minutes they did harden up so just be careful not to overcook them we got 28 cookies out of the batch and the last step is to drizzle the glaze on top all right so our cookies are done and sean's gonna do his taste test they seem to come out really nice they feel soft and I already tried it but I want to see what you have to say first okay washing pretty good you weren't expecting that oh that was not very lemony like the glaze and they're soft they're very soft I think the glaze makes it so I really do like the cookie as well the glaze just seems to kind of finish it completely I think without the glaze it would have something missing so I highly recommend putting the glaze on it I did use the lemon zest in the glaze as well I don't know if it was necessary but I did put it in there and it's kind of nice to see the little flecks of the lemon zest in the glaze the cookies very soft I like the white chocolate chips in there they're still kind of warm right now that we're eating them so I'm not sure if it's gonna harden up a little bit but right now it's kind of just melting in your mouth but there you go now we have about another two hundred different putting combinations we can try but at least it was good so now we know something we can do with all that pudding that's right make thousands of wedding cookies no well I don't have that much lemon I've got a lot of chocolate and vanilla and pistachio so I guess we'll make new combinations do another one you must like them you don't really like lemon do you killing me smalls", "kq5pun897sw": "hi I'm desi the Baker today I'll be showing you how to make easy white chocolate cookies that are so decadent very delicious and

so much for watching guys I'll see you next week goodbye [Music]", "i7KZ4dSj-GU": "hey guys what's up today I am so excited to share with you my family's secret chocolate chip cookie recipe and we always get so many compliments on this people ask us to bake them all the time at any time I have my friends try them they always say it is hands-down the best chocolate chip cookie they've ever had that is because our secret ingredient that we put inside of it is actually vanilla pudding and this is going to make the cookie seem as if it's not completely all the way cooked through even though it is and that's because it has kind of like that gooey Center and they stay nice and chewy and just mushy even after you've taken them out of the oven you don't have to eat them same day that I do think they taste the best straight out of the oven so without further ado let's go ahead and get started to get started I already washed my hands but now I'm going to go over and create the oven to 350 degrees now we get to do the actual fun part which is the baking so I'm going to start off in the bowl of my electric mixer with a paddle attachment you can also just use a hand mixer if that's what you have I am taking two sticks of room-temperature butter it's very important that you actually let it set at room temperature you don't try to heat it up in the microwave if you forget it in the fridge when you're ready to bake just because it does change the texture and consistency of the cookies and it also will be at a different temperature throughout with the butter being a little bit colder yeah okay so basically I turn this down and I'm gonna start feeding it pretty slowly and then you can go up a little bit then I have 3/4 cup of granulated cane sugar and 3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar I'm going to mix both of these in probably half of each of them at a time just so it really has a good amount of time to completely combined now I'm going to keep adding the second half of the plain white cane sugar speed it up a little now I'm going in with some of the brown sugar now I'm just going to take a spatula and make sure that I get all of this down on the sides you really want to make sure that everything is getting combined and you're not going to be left with like a dry patch at the end now I have two eggs and these are both at room temperature so they've been sitting out just as long as the butter and this is a very important step also to make sure that everything is that a consistent temperature when it goes into the oven so that it bakes evenly and I'm going to start by just pouring one of the eggs in and turning on the whisk it that was like food porn right there with so good now I'm just going to get the signs down with a spatula again continue eating and I'm going to put in one teaspoon of organic vanilla extract I do think I can taste the difference between organic and non-organic so we're going to have very vanilla to eat today I think that's got to be about it cheese spoon because it's half a teaspoon so I was going to need two of these that I got in there so you want to put in 1 teaspoon of working experiment extract then we are going in with the secret ingredient this is the vanilla setting so this is a 5 foot 1 ounce box sometimes they're in smaller quantities you want to make sure you have about 5 ounces I prefer the flavor french vanilla for this that's what my family uses but I could not find that my grocery store because vanilla so it's going to have to do now I'm going to pour it in and combining so I'm going to do about 1/2 turn it up now I have two cups of all-purpose flour and I have one teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of baking soda I'm going to my oven is preheated I'm going to go ahead and with all the dry ingredients right here together we'll just be very dry ingredients so just these three ones I'm going to whisk this together to combine then I'm going to gradually add this into my mixer so I'm going to start from a little gonna start with about half and the last one if you are going to be baking a lot I definitely recommend investing in a stand-up mixer it is something that is completely changed the way I bake and I recommend it all right now is the fun part we are going to add one cup of dry oats not the instant oats but these are just the dry player oats that you cook on the stove top these I would not consider to be oatmeal chocolate chip cookies they are definitely chocolate chip cookies with just a little bit of oatmeal that gives an added texture and it's just really delicious but it's not so much oatmeal in it where is overwhelming so I'm just going to combine that and this is where the batter starts to get really thick now you want to add in your chocolate chips I really recommend verging on the Ghiradelli brand I think it just tastes a lot better than the typical like Nestle Tollhouse ones I also like using Hershey sometimes but I know it's a little bit more expensive but with the semi-sweet morsels I really do taste a difference in the Ghiradelli so I'm going to add this into my mixer and I actually add the inspired bag I think the red key calls for like 3/4 of the bag that I like my chocolate chip cookies to be chocolate chip cookies so that's what I'm going to do and when you are combining this you don't actually want to completely mix the chips all the way in that's not what you're trying to do you're just trying to kind of fold it in so I just say very gently sprinkling them in accents on a slow speed don't try to really beat it in because that can actually break some of them then you get more of like a brown muddy chocolate chip cookie instead of like a cookie with chocolate chips in it okay gotta get started alright and now our batter is done now you are not supposed to eat this right now because it has raw eggs in it but I've already had a whole life and I think that lightening pretty much doesn't strike twice so it is fo delicious so I'm going to go ahead and take this paddle attachment off we do not need that anymore and then for me to get the best equally sized chocolate chip cookies I like to use a small ice cream scoop this is not a standard ice cream scoop this is a small one I got it I think externa table and it actually makes the perfect sized cookie that completely cook evenly and they look like you bought them from a bakery because they're all uniform and the same it's weird how serious I am about my chocolate chip cookies but it's a big deal to my family like I'm sharing this recipe with you and some of them may not be now that I have the size and approximate shape of these right I go around and just kind of make them a little rounder okay and then I do a quick press down in the center not too flat but just enough now you want to put these in the oven for about 810 minutes I start to watch them around these seven minute mark because there's nothing worse than a burnt chocolate chip cookie [Music] these cookies that might not look completely done right now but this is how you want them to look because out there on this hot hand for an additional five minutes they are going to continue looking from at the bottom so you know that are ready to come out and you can see this golden brown grin around the bottom edge and if you leave them on the sheet for five minutes before you transfer them onto a sheet and that's it I really hope you guys enjoyed this make sure you leave it in a comment below if you try this recipe and what you think about it and I'll see you with my next video bye yeah that one ring so bad okay you're on but you're going to", "4kP0v0rXqfA": "in this video I'm going to share with you one of my favorite chewy chocolate chip cookie recipes and at the end of the video I'm gonna show you a way that you can freeze that cookie dough that way you can make fresh baked cookies whenever you're craving and I'll also show you how we store these cookies that way they stay nice and fresh and soft even days after your baking [Music] what's good everyone if this is the first time we're meeting my name is Philip Lemoine and I'm actually a full-time cinematographer but I love to cook before I jump into this recipe I just want to quickly plug my youtube channel aside from all of my vlogging and business book I also post a ton of cooking videos with honestly just great tasting tried and true recipes for dishes that I make not just weekly but even on special occasions there are even a couple of videos where I share some of my favorite dishes made with my mom I try and post a video a week so if you want to catch more then make sure you spank that subscribe button so there's like a million chocolate-chip cookie recipes on the internet and I swear to you I've tried every single one of them including BuzzFeed tasties perfect chocolate chip cookie although I think all of them are great a few of them just had some of those extra ingredients or extra steps that I just didn't think we're necessary and I always kept coming back to this recipe that I found on all recipes mom I think that all chocolate chip cookie recipes are kind of the same but what makes them big and chewy is the way that you incorporate those ingredients and the ingredients where these chocolate chip cookies are going to be 2 cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 teaspoon of salt 3/4 cups of unsalted butter about a stick and a half and you're going to want this melted 1 cup of packed brown sugar 1/2 cup of white sugar one tablespoon of vanilla extract 1 egg and one egg yolk and 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips or a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips the first step is to preheat the oven to 325 degrees next you're going to sift together the flour baking soda and salt then set that to the side the secret to making the chocolate chip cookies chewy is that we're gonna melt the butter we're gonna end up mixing everything in the butter so I'm just gonna melt it right into my large bowl [Music] so once the butter is melted I'm just gonna go ahead and mix in both the brown and the white sugar and I'm gonna keep mixing that up until it's all creamy and all together [Music] [Music] next you're gonna beat in the vanilla egg and egg yolk until it's light and creamy after you'll mix and sifted ingredients until just blended so at this point I added all the dry ingredients and you don't want to over mix it you just want to mix it to the point where your forearms on fire and then I think you're pretty much good show the cookie dough should look something like this [Music] so now I'm gonna go ahead and add one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and then we'll go ahead and mix that all together you're gonna want to make sure you use a wooden spoon when you do this [Music] sometimes it's helpful to use a spatula to sort of get everything off of the wooden spoon and what I like about this spatula is I got these little rubber like into it and it kind of forms to the bowl that way you can kind of work all the ingredients in together and kind of work everything off the bowl and back into it so so now that the cookie dough is all ready to go what I did is I went ahead and I lined a cookie sheet with some parchment paper and I have this one ounce ice cream scoop that I'm going to be using I think this is like a good size for not too large cookie and you can fit a few I think you can fit about six to eight on this cookie sheet I'll be sure to put a link in the bio for one of these I think they're great I use them for a lot of my recipes and one ounce seems to be the magic number for a lot of the things that I use it for so so I'm going to go ahead and scoop out a few of these cookies I'm gonna put them on this baking sheet [Music] you want to make sure to keep these cookies just a couple inches apart because they will spread when you bake now that I got these all ready to go in the oven you're gonna let them bake for about 15 to 17 minutes just want to keep an eye on them and once they start to get golden brown around the edges that's when you'll want to pull them out and let them cool so anytime that I make these cookies what I actually like to do is I'd like to make a huge batch usually I'll triple the recipe that I put online and what I'll do is I'll scoop out a bunch of individual cookies and I'll place them close together on a piece of parchment paper and then what I'll do is I'll throw this into the freezer and I'll pour freeze these I'll let them go overnight in the freezer and then what I'll do is I'll take them out once they're frozen and then I'll put those into a bag and that way whenever we're craving cookies we don't have to go through the whole process of mixing everything together we already have a bunch of individual cookies frozen in our freezer I wouldn't recommend baking them directly out of the freezer what I would say is maybe at least let them thaw out maybe come to room temperature before you throw them in the oven and then just bake them like you normally would at 325 degrees for about 15 to 17 minutes so once the cookies are done you're gonna want to go ahead and let them rest on the cookie sheet for a little bit before you transfer them over to a cooling rack cooling rack isn't super necessary but I think they're really great I mean aside from just cloning out cookies I do like to place other things on here so that it cools off quicker as well as doesn't get soggy for example when I fry things I like to put them on the rack that way the oil can drip down and it's not sitting on like a napkin and a plate or just getting it soggy sitting in its own grease so I highly recommend one and I'll put a link in the description I mean I probably just grab [Music] and there they are folks my favorite chewy chocolate chip cookie I'm not really sure how I could show you they're chewy maybe I could break one in half [Music] take a look at the inside here I'm going to take a bite breach so if I could describe the texture of these cookies I would say that the outside has a nice soft crunch to it but the inside is a really dense chewy middle and that chew is sort of like a caramel like the type of chew so it's really chewy and that's even the flavor to a nice current caramely chocolaty cookie flavor so I think what really got me hooked to these cookies was honestly like a day or two later they're still chewy and they're still nice and soft and they still have that same crunch and I feel like most cookie recipes that I've tried in the past you know once you bake them and you put them away like next day they're brick hard and you know they lost that like nice soft fresh-baked texture and I feel like these stay true to their texture and their chew even days after so I actually like to store these cookies in these food saver containers and what they do is they actually vacuum seal these and it sucks all of the air to these containers which lets them last so much longer I think a lot of people avoid purchasing a food saver mainly because they think that they have to use those resealable bags but honestly I use mostly in mason jars and these reusable containers to store most of our food because of the different container sizes you can store different types of food in different amounts of food and I really think that this thing will pay for itself over time because there's so many times we've bought food in bulk and it just went bad before we can eat it all I really wish this video was sponsored by food saver but it's not and even though it's not I mean still would highly recommend one it's something that we use daily it sits on our countertop and like I said we've saved so much food which in turn saved us so much money so I'll be sure to leave a link in the bio for where you can purchase one in Amazon there's a bunch of different models this one is the fancy one that feeds the plastic bags which I don't think it's necessary like I said we mainly use the reusable containers as well as mason jars so thank you guys so much again for watching if you enjoyed this video please be sure to hit the like

cookies see I've affectionately referred to you guys as my cookies for years but yet I don't have a dang cookie recipe on the channel that changes today with these super delicious double chocolate cookies they're so easy to make so let's do it all right first things first I Papa freak saw the hood in my bed okay so we're gonna pour some melted butter into a bowl then add in the brown sugar and some granulated sugar and I'm gonna whisk using just a hand whisk I don't want to use my electric mixer but sometimes I get a little excited and I overdo it so we're just gonna hand mix it today really really well when that's done we can add in our egg and some pure vanilla extract the good stuff break out that whisk again and lose your mind honey just mix it really really well until the batter starts to drool off the whisk you see how it's just dripping ever so delicately and it looks so good that's the consistency you want good now it's time to sift our dry ingredients into the mix so we're gonna add some all-purpose flour a little bit of baking powder not so it up with the Box down and a pinch of salt we'll use salted butter but you know it's always good to add a little bit more salt sweets need salt so once you have all of that sifted in go ahead and fold it into the batter until it's nice soft and pliable like this now we can add in our chocolate chips get a good quality milk chocolate chip and then some white chocolate I just took a white chocolate bar and chopped it up and then I add it in some walnuts it's optional but I highly recommend you add the walnuts it adds a nice little crunch and texture mix it together well like this get it nice and combined and then we're going to cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate so it can set for like 30 to 40 minutes when that time is up we're going to preheat the oven to 350 degrees grab your cookie dough scoop and then scoop out the dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet and we are going to bake these for 10 to twelve minutes on 350 now when you take them out it may seem like they're a little underdone they're not okay there's gonna be a little bit pill but just make sure they're nice and golden brown around the edges now we want to allow them to cool completely before boy let it cool completely in the meantime we're gonna pour some milk damn it look at pour some milk throw a little

have his cookie now until next time be blessed boy I said one vile", "ON93zWUo5h8": "so for the last few two or three years I found that tahini chocolate chip cookies were getting a really popular online I started to see so many recipes for it so this year I decided to do my own version so I love the bitter taste of cocoa powder and I found that it really brings out the nutty sweetness of tahini so I wanted to create a chocolate chip cookie that had more cocoa powder in it so I corporated that into it to really bring out the nuttiness of the tahini it took me about six or seven tries to get it right that involves the amount of butter to use and is it better to have melted butter as opposed to softened butter softened butter makes it a little bit chewier melted butter makes them spread a little bit more so it's kind of getting that fine happy middle ground between the two cookies and hopefully I have the perfect cookie for your holidays", "-dHB_Y3TajQ": "in this video I'm going to be making some eggless chocolate chip cookies if you are curious about the recipe if you want written instructions the recipe is going to be at hamidonet I'll give you the link to where I found the recipe so what you're gonna do is heat your oven to 350 degrees you're gonna need a cookie tray with a piece of parchment paper you need a cookie scoop or just you could use a spoon too but I have a cookie scoop and these are the ingredients you need you need one cup plus 2 tablespoons of flour you need half a teaspoon of baking soda 1 stick of butter at room temperature 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup of light brown sugar you need half a teaspoon of vanilla 2 tablespoons of milk and half a cup of chocolate chips so the first thing you do is you have you put your dry ingredients together which is your flour and your baking soda and you put those together and you take a whisk and this is just an attachment that I have so the flour baking soda and you kind of mix it up like this and then you're gonna set this aside and then we're going to take our butter and we're gonna put it in our mixer and we're gonna mix it until it's creamy I've had this butter sitting out for probably an hour and so you want to use your whisk attachment on this as well and mix it until it's creamy like I said [Music] okay now you're gonna take both of your sugars your white sugar and your brown sugar and you're going to mix those add your milk and vanilla and mix again [Music] you want to add your dry ingredients put that right in there and mix it again start it off on low so that it doesn't cook that [Music] [Music] you take this off of your the stand and you want to stir in your baking chips and I'm using the Hershey's milk chocolate baking chips so once you have these stirred in you want to leave this just like it is and put this in the refrigerator for half an hour to let it chill so once a half an hour is up we'll be back okay this has been in the refrigerator for 30 minutes but I'm gonna use my cookie scoop and you see I have my parchment paper and so I'm just gonna place balls of these onto my paper [Music] they're cookie sheets that I'm gonna fill up but while I'm doing that I'm gonna put these in the oven for 11 minutes to bake this is how the cookies look after 11 minutes and they didn't spread out very much I was worried that they might spread out a little bit more but they didn't on my second cookie sheet I only got 5 cookies so 16 there will be 16 total cookies that this recipe made for me of course you could make them bigger or smaller but I think 16 is a good amount and they look beautiful so I'm gonna let them sit here and cool completely okay we have our cookies here and they look absolutely we do this one has tons of chips delicious yeah I know that's what I look at and they're perfect on the bottom no they're really not yeah these are eggless no way huh or they haven't listen you know they have flour baking soda regular sugar brown sugar vanilla milk stick of butter chocolate chips that is delicious it's a very big so I wonder what makes them how about the point of an egg is anyway absolutely delicious a binding I guess mm-hmm very good that the texture of that is it's soft hmm you you get a better e flavor from my that's full Tom touch of course it's a whole stick of butter you know so hmm I would definitely make these young I think this is perfect if you can't have a for some reason yeah well more Jicarilla you're allergic or if you're out of eggs if you happen to have everything else no you're just out of eggs you could you don't have to use chocolate chips you could use peanut butter chips you could use well white chips you could use what did I say butterscotch we replace them with some coming up like a or that is a very absolute lie dealership if you didn't if I didn't know their records I would you saying that's a really good choice or good yeah you would have no idea that these were any different no sound they're really good so if you are I think most people are allergic to egg they don't do a gross stuff no more EXO or deej don't want somehow a chicken but maybe one yeah these are really good yeah I think that's a fantastic cookie so well like I said if you want the written instructions I'm going to attend me dead I'm going to post a link to where I found these because I went to someone else's blog and I found them so I will post a link to that and I hope you enjoy it I hope you try them out if you do let me know I think these are perfect maybe those we're so easy to make too so thanks for watching

these in five minutes flat\nput these in a bowl with some milk and this will be your new favorite way to enjoy\nchocolate chip cookies okay so we're going to start with some butter which we're going\nto melt we want a really soft loose toe for these cookies and you'll see why as\nwe go along if you were to cream the butter with the sugars you would just\nget a regular traditional cookie dough and we don't want that for this recipe\nto that I've gone ahead and added the vanilla extract\nand the sugars if you're new to my channel welcome make sure to subscribe\nand click that notification bell I post new videos every week once those are\ncombined you can add the egg and the step to dry ingredients which you'll see\nin a moment now let's talk for a moment ideally you want to use an extra-large\negg if your batter should seem quite stiff you can add one to two tablespoons\nof warm milk and you'll only know this once you've mixed in the flour the\nconsistency of your dough will depend on the flour and the egg you use and so\njust keep in mind that you may need that extra milk to loosen the dough this is\nthe consistency you want the dough to be is going to look and feel like a cross\nbetween a very thick cake batter and a loose\ncookie dough that's perfect I've added the chocolate chips and this is ready to\nbe transferred into a piping bag this is why we made a soft dough we're going to\npipe the cookies that's the easiest fastest method with the best results I\nremember at one of the hotels that I used to work ad we used to have\ncompetitions to see who could pipe the cookies the fastest even if this is your\nfirst time piping cookies you'll find it's one of the easiest ways to make\ncookies and you'll ditch the cookie ice cream scoop method try to make these\nroughly all the same size so they bake evenly\nand leave some space between each cookie because these will spread out once\nyou've piped out all your cookies you're going to lightly and I mean lightly with\nyour hands and press the cookies down add some more chocolate chips on top and\nmove on to piping the next sheet of cookies this recipe does make quite a\nlot I want to say at least 150 many cookies but that really depends on how\nsmall you make these the beauty of these cookies is that they don't need any of\nrefrigeration at all so you can make these and bake these right away one\nsheet at a time and a preheated oven at 160 degrees Celsius or 320 Fahrenheit\nfor about five to seven minutes allow the cookies to cool completely this will\nalso allow them to set and

the sourdough a discard in my own kitchen and I'm going to share that recipe with you today so let's get started [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you for watching I hope you enjoy the video and these cookies are kid tested husband tested me tested we all love them and we think you will too so give them a try and have a great day please like and subscribe and come back and see us again bye bye [Music] you", "ZrQjCaLuuVs": "this cookie is a little bit different but it uses something that is so being talked about right now matcha I'm sure so many of you have heard about it because it apparently has amazing health benefits and well I don't necessarily know about all those benefits in a cookie I know it's good so it may deplete a lot of those benefits but we'll just pretend these are really healthy cookie because it is a matcha white chocolate chip cookie and let me tell you is one of my favorite cookie of the month it's a little bit green and this month that is perfect so let's get started and make one of the best cookies cookies don't really change lot and we start off the same as so many others so we're going to take one of my favorite ingredients some room temperature butter throw right into the stand mixer then we're just going to add some brown sugar lightly packed just kind of lightly pack it with the palm of your hand dump that right in the mixer and then some white sugar now just cream back together now a lot of people do not cream cookies long enough this is what really creates a lot of air in the cookie and will give them good lift later on and really starts to dissolve the sugar so whip them until it is extremely light and fluffy and that's at least three to five minutes I know you think you do it but time yourself you probably don't I know I used to not so make sure to do it for long enough until it is really light and fluffy once it's done just scrape down the sides of the bowl just to make sure everything is incorporated completely and then we can move on next you just want to add one a and I just like to crack into another bowl because I seem to always get some shell in it even though I do what you were supposed to do and not get shell in it I always do so just crack into a bowl and then that way you can get the shell out easier than have it being your cookies put that in and then let that mix in and then you just want one yolk adding just a yolk adds some more fat to the cookies without adding all that moisture of the egg white so they won't be so cakey but they'll be really rich and delicious which who doesn't want that my cookie once you add the yolk and just make sure it mixes in completely then you can just add in some vanilla I know I should probably measure my vanilla but I never do I you just usually dump because I love vanilla once that's mixed in we can just sift together our dry ingredients so in a separate bowl I like to just use a big sieve that you would use like a colander for other things so just put your flour right into that and then your matcha powder or matcha green tea you can find this at any health food store or usually in the maybe health market of your grocery store it's really in right now so it shouldn't be hard to find if you're not used to matcha it does kind of smell different but don't be worried it kind of has an earthy or grassy smell to it but it is so delicious if you haven't had it so don't worry about it and just throw it right in and then you want to add a little baking soda and finally a little bit of salt just sift that together right into a bowl and then with the mixer running on low just slowly add the dry ingredients right in there after all that is mixed in you can just add a few drops of green food coloring if you like now this is of course completely optional it is festive for st. Patrick's Day but also the matcha powder it gives them a green hue but not a fully green color so they kind of just looked a little off and odd and I just think a little bit food coloring makes it a little bit more appealing and pretty look at but completely up to you it will not change the flavor once they're in and incorporating you just take the bowl off the mixer clean off the beater and then just fold in your white chocolate chips now I sometimes just add my chocolate chips right to the mixer and let it mix in but I use an aftermarket beater on mine that kind of gets everything off the size of the bowl and I've broken like two of them because it's a little bit too much with the chocolate chips so I like to just fold them in in that way better safe than sorry once they are folded in you are ready to go so just take a parchment-lined baking sheet scoop out your cookies with a handy cookie scoop and place them right into a preheated 350 degree oven it is important to pre-heat your oven because when the oven is heating up it sometimes gets extremely hot to start with and then cools down just make sure it is preheated for at least fifteen to thirty minutes before you're going to bake when they are slightly puffed and just set around the edges and just starting to turn golden I just said the word just a lot sorry then you know that they are ready so pull them out and let them cool in the pan for at least five minutes that's where they're going to finish baking so that's really important once they've cooled for about five minutes just remove them from the pan and put them right onto a rack to cool completely you'll see they'll kind of get those wonderful cracks in the top and just settle a little bit and they are amazing I cannot wait for you guys to try these cookies they are perfect for st.

"4WwWkwwv4KM": "today on the stay at home chef I'm showing you how to make chocolate chip cookie shot this recipe is an easy do-it-yourself at-home version of Dominique Ansel famous chocolate-chip cookie shots that are sold at his bakery in New York now I've had the opportunity to go to his bakery and they are absolutely divine I would highly recommend stopping and ordering one if you ever find yourself in New York City today I'm going to show you how to make an easy at-home version so that you can enjoy it even if your funds don't allow you to travel to New York to get one we're going to start with one cup of shortening and this will allow the cookies to hold their shape a little bit better than butter then we're going to add in half a cup of brown sugar and the third a cup of white sugar take a hand mixer and cream this together once you have a smooth creamy light-brown batter it's time to start adding in our other ingredients starting with one egg two teaspoons of vanilla extract and then half a teaspoon of salt we can cream this in as well once that's mixed in I'm going to add in two cups of all-purpose flour but instead of using my hand mixer to stir this in I'm going to switch to a wooden spoon to stir it all together this mixture should be a little bit more dry and crumbly than regular chocolate chip cookie dough but if you press it together it should be able to hold its shape then I'm going to stir in one cup of mini chocolate chips next we're going to shape our cookie dough into that fun cup shape to do that you can actually buy special molds on Amazon and I'll give a link in the video description to that or you can use a muffin tin if you don't want to buy a special item for this it's just a little bit of a short fatter cup for that but today I'm going to use what I like to use which is a popover pan if you have one and they are a little bit taller and thinner than a muffin tin so it works really well to form that cup shape so what I'm going to do is take a spoonful of the batter and place it into my popover pan and then I'm going to use my fingers to press it against the sides and bottom of the pan and mold it into that cup shape you want to press that dough in so that it's as spin as you can get it while still forming a sturdy wall you should end up with a little something like this and I like to make sure I clean up the edges give it a nice finished look then we're going to bake these in a 350 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes this recipe makes about nine cups so you may have to work in batches especially if you're using a popover pan if you're using a muffin tin it should make about 12 once they come out of the oven they might be a little bit puffy so just take either a butter knife or a spoon and against the sides to reform that cup shape you want to make sure you do that while it's still warm so you get that nice cup shape next we're going to take a cutting board and place it on top of the popover pan and then gently flip it over and tap the top of the pan then lift it off and the cookies should slide right out let the cookies cool completely on the cutting board before moving on to the next step I've melted another cup of chocolate chips I'm going to take a spoonful and spread it over the inside of the cup make sure you get the bottom and all of the edges once the inside is coated with chocolate make sure you let it cool and harden completely before pouring in your favorite beverage for me of course the best combination is milk and cookies feel free to be creative with the beverage you serve in your delicious cookie cups you can find the full written recipe in the video description be sure to subscribe and check out the rest of my channel where you can find hundreds of restaurant-quality recipes you can easily make at home see you later [Music]", "hCzVqaFMlIw": "soft and chewy thin and crisp or cakey how do you like your chocolate chip cookie I've actually received countless questions and comments on the chocolate chip cookie and I want to show you how to make the perfect chocolate chip cookie for you and there are two determining factors in the overall texture and look of the cookie two special ingredients for soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies it's two sticks of butter but if you want it to be thinner or if you want it to be cakey er you're gonna have to adjust the ratio of the recipe for a thin and crisp cookie it's two and a half sticks and for a cakey cookie it's one in three quarter sticks I'm gonna put the two sticks into the KitchenAid mixer here and make sure using unsalted butter when you're baking you always want to be able to adjust the salt on your own I'm going to add the sugar now and sugar is the other ingredient that really affects the overall texture and look of the cookie so I'm making soft and chewy cookies here and that is one cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of granulated sugar the greater quantity of brown sugar adds chewiness to the cookie because it has molasses in it for something that's thin and crisp cookie you want a higher ratio of granulated sugar so we have a 1 and a quarter of a cup of granulated sugar here too 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar and for a cakey cookie you need to reduce the overall sugar in general and we have 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and 1/4 of a cup of brown sugar so I'm gonna cream together the butter and the sugar and that's going to incorporate air into the batter and cleaning is a very important step here because what it does it dissolves the sugar into the butter and it also incorporates air which will help to leaven your cookie so the butter and sugar is light and fluffy and to this I'm going to add two eggs now the rest of the ingredients for this chocolate-chip cookie are the same regardless if you're making soft and chewy thin and crisp or cakey so two eggs one at a time you want to add them into your mixture your butter and sugar mixture here two teaspoons of the best quality vanilla extract and I'm gonna eyeball it here and now I'm gonna add the dry ingredients two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and baking soda is what helps cookies cakes pancakes spread baking powder puffs so think of it that way soda spreads powder puffs so that's a half teaspoon and one teaspoon of coarse salt using kosher salt here and whisk that together and you really want to make sure you take your time here and whisk the ingredients together you don't want any pockets of leavener in your flour mixture make sure it's evenly distributed and then this goes into your mixer and I like to just dump it in all at once so mix on slow speed until it's just combined add two cups of the best quality semi-sweet chocolate and just mix this until it's just incorporated don't go any further than that otherwise you're gonna toughen your cookie you're gonna develop gluten that's in the flour you're gonna end up with a tough cookie so now for scooping and baking about a tablespoon of cookie dough batter two inches apart on a parchment lined baking sheet and I like to use these ice cream scoops for perfectly portioning out cookies you get really nice rounded sides so these go into a 350 degree oven and depending on the variation whether it's chewy thin and crisp or cakey it will take anywhere from 8 to 15 minutes so there you have it the trick to getting the perfect chocolate chip cookie just the way you like it if you have any kitchen conundrums if you have any baking conundrums write in the comment

the people who want them super crispy wafer like soft and chewy raw cookie dough in the center standing up off of the baking sheet and the things that came out most of all were crispy chewy having like a crisp edge but that feeds into a little bit of like a gooey chewy Center so that's what we tried to achieve here and chocolate chip cookies in particular they're like snowflakes at the end of the day like they're all a little bit different for recipes where they are a very well-known thing usually what we try to do is have a really long development process the reason being that what I like to do is from the beginning I'll cook recipes that are very well reviewed just to see what's out there and what we liked about each one to try the Rick Martinez ones oh yeah well I'm very familiar with the Rick Martinez chocolate sort of toffee chip cookies I love that recipe honestly like this takes probably most closely after that cookie as its inspiration we worked you know over a period of like several weeks you know I had people trying these I went through multiple multiple multiple rounds of development even with my own cookies once I understood the direction I wanted to go in but I knew from a flavor perspective that I wanted at least some brown butter in this cookie so that is the starting point we're gonna take this to the stove and we're gonna take it from there so here's the thing about brown butter and cookies when you use like a liquid fat there's no need to cream out the butter and the sugar which is amazing because in this instance you don't need to use a stand mixer or a hand mixer for that matter for this recipe you know we're asking very little of you in terms of equipment what we are asking is that you brown your butter so just let it kind of all melt together over low heat so I'm starting to get a little browning that's great I just want to make sure everything stays moving that nothing sticks to the pan so that's the kind of color I'm talking about I'm gonna transfer that kind of quickly so I can stop the cooking I added the rest of the butter right away it might kind of start to foam and spit a little bit and that means that you're driving off the water content of the butter which is what we don't want to do so I'm just gonna do a little tester with one piece of the butter just to see if it's cooled enough yeah a lot of people were very insistent in wanting grams for this and you know what they're absolutely right we heard you and we republish the recipe with grams you know just to take into account your needs and wishes honestly there's no reason why we should be not publishing grams and our baking recipes so this is dark brown sugar which has the highest molasses content molasses actually has a good amount of acidity to it and that acidity is what is going to react with our baking soda which is you know our only leavener in this cookie aside from our egg so brown sugar is going in along with 1/4 cup white sugar as you can see this is gonna stay super grainy because the fat does not want to dissolve it however the sugar is more or less smooth from the standpoint of there are no huge lumps here I'm going to mix my dry ingredients just so that they're ready to go so this is one and a half cups of all-purpose flour I'm putting in 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda and then one and a quarter teaspoons of kosher salt I'm just gonna incorporate these just a little bull make a difference you need to do this in the smallest Bowl possible only using one whole egg for this recipe and part of the reason for that is egg whites act akin to water in terms of how they interact with the proteins and the flour so I didn't want to introduce too much liquid from the standpoint of having a dough that was too loose to work with what I found was that what had the biggest impact on the flavor of the cookie but also helped control spread and gave like kind of a cool kind of glossy Sheen was the yolk so I've got one whole egg and then I've got two yolks from large eggs here so one whole egg plus two yolks going in here and this is the point at which those sugars are gonna start to dissolve it's gonna take on this like nice kind of almost matte Sheen so you don't have to go crazy whisking but that's the vanilla going in but you definitely want to see that change where it goes smooth on you so here we have guitard 70-percent bar chocolate so it's like really you know kind of assertively bittersweet you get that fruitiness and that kind of like that brightness from the acidity of the chocolate I chop these into like pretty rough pieces and what's nice about the bar is like you can do it like relatively quickly and what's cool about breaking down the bar yourself is that you get these lovely irregular pieces you know you get some like big fat chocolate moments and then you get these like little kind of chocolate shards that was an aesthetic to that that I really really liked I felt so much better about putting a chocolate chip cookie out into the world that like got like it had a little bit more of a modern look to it with those kind of graphic regular chocolate pieces so now dry ingredients are going in folding these together there's not really much of a danger of overworking this certainly not by doing it by hand you know you definitely want to work all of that flour into this mixture just in the last like 30 seconds it went from being like fairly loose to like loose but stiffening by the second so for anyone who felt like their first pass might have spread too much I would say like this is the point where you know once a chocolate goes in you could rest this dough just kind of room-temperature even for five or ten minutes that shouldn't make like a pretty big difference in terms of the getting the flour to hydrate and and stiffen this dough up so chocolate is going in there is gonna be a lot of spread with these this is about the consistency that it should be you know it should be able to stand up on the the baking sheet hold that detail the cookie scoop just allows me to know exactly how much I'm putting into each one and therefore how much space I need on the cooking sheet so I find like eight cookies on a sheet is about all you can do you know so you do need two cookie sheets for this one person was like quite irate that this recipe was only yielding 16 cookies at the end of the day wouldn't you rather have like 16 like dangerously close to perfection cookies than like 24 smaller you know compromise cookies they can these at 375 which is you know kind of on the higher end for a cookie part of it is that we want the heat of the oven to really set that edge give it a little bit of color and a little bit crispness but once the heat kind of sets the edge we want it to kind of spread out to about yay big or so once that edge is set and baked it's gonna kind of arrest the lateral spread of the cookie and make it want to spread up a little bit so anyway here goes nothing I like to stagger them a little bit on the baking sheets just to keep the air circulating around so eight minutes you want to reach should we look at some reviews oh yeah we wait let's read those relocating reviews let me grab my computer all right and figs of Montreal honestly the best basic cookie recipe I've ever used these are definitely a few notches up from regular chocolate chip cookies the brown butter added great flavor made mine pretty large and still had 24 cookies that seems wrong now let's get to some of the bad stuff not sure what I'm doing wrong these cookies turned out really runny for me anyone have suggested made these cookies using the new weight measurements provided they spend quite a bit so I ended up with a thinner cookies gonna usually prefer but the real issue I'm having with these is how greasy oily they feel when you're eating them I mean that's like that's something that's kind of interesting to me you know the comments about like grease eNOS because like when is grease butter and when is grease eNOS butteriness not to skip ahead here but just for the sake of argument there is in the texture like a lot more kind of like richness forward quality but in terms of like you know like grease eNOS like I certainly have like more chocolate than butter on my fingers right now so I don't know what to chalk it up to if it's like you know a different brand the flower that's hydrating in a different way different amount of protein you know that's not you know so it's not like kind of like activating this similar amount of gluten to like what we're developing with here like this is far from over or it's like if there's anything and that Guns N'Roses has taught us is that like it's never over you know Never Say Never Axl can reach out to / they can get back on the same page you know they can make you know their next album happen and you know look like there's a lot of people who reached out to me on via you know DM like on Instagram and I feel like I responded or reacted to the vast majority of them I tried to diagnose issues where I could I also frankly saw like a lot of great looking cookies and you know at the end of the day like there is gonna be a tremendous amount of variability just between ovens users ingredients and all the rest of it into it as you can see like even between the two baking sheets these have a little bit more kind of cracking across the top these have a little bit more of a ripple to them same same dough same oven same time but snowflakes I feel like this is my Everest I feel like this is something that you could work on and refine your entire life I will never be done with it I am it and it is me and yeah it's it's very intense putting this out into the world you know so anyway fly they're so beautiful I know you know I I see that too you know yeah no way because every time I said it my parents would reward me for speaking oh yeah another cookie oh yeah no duh great future food editors unite I mean that's like yeah that's hot that's hot perfect yeah that's nice I don't know if this is something people have noted there's a seabream into the cookie there richness of the chocolate the bitterness the like the texture the whole thing it is a real delight all right cool All Right see ya wow they're beautiful are these bees best their ba is tried real hard the crisp yeah it's trying to get those two things happen at the same time that's that's that's tricky gets almost like that like crumbly crispness like the edge will do that and you have the Center bends that's the world I'm living in take the journey with me yeah make cookies be happy that's all I have to say I'm done engineering our own school we're good it's cool my mom said I needs to I need to smile more in my videos anyway so Andy's uh and he's on target with that", "degkGwsyUx8": "First place 120g of butter into a mixing bowl Add 70g of brown sugar to the butter Then add 70g of

gently mix the ingredients You should achieve a smooth consistency like this. Take 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract or vanilla syrup and add this to your mixture Continue to whisk the mixture until the vanilla is mixed through completely In a new bowl, take 160g of plain flour Then add 1 teaspoon of baking powder to the bowl of flour Add half a teaspoon of salt Pour the bowl of flour, salt and baking soda into the first mixing bowl Gently mix the ingredients together Place 80g of macadamia nuts on a chopping board Using a large knife, chop the macadamia nuts into smaller pieces.

whoa how is it you like it [Music] hi guys I'm here and I'm Ilana and today we are on our way to start our journey to find the best chocolate chip cookies in New York City so there are so many places in New York City to get and we narrowed it down to four top spots based on internet research word of mouth and a little bit of personal experience and I am starving so let's go do it Ilana and I luckily have similar tastes when we're talking about the ideal chocolate chip cookie we're looking for a crunchy crispy exterior and a gooey interior and a bunch of chocolate chips spotted throughout the cookie our first stop is Jacques Torres chocolate Jacques Torres is a world-famous pastry chef and chocolatier chef Torres specializes in handcrafted chocolates made with fresh real ingredients hello I am Jacques Torres from Jacques Torres chocolates and this is the home of the best cookies in New York this is my go-to spot for chocolate chip cookies I come here at least once a month and it's conveniently very close to my house in my office so it's easy to stop by it's very dangerous give to your customer what your customer wants an American love cookies so when you do the things right your cookies will be a little bit crispy on the outside soft on the center with a nice layering of chocolates not too chewy not too soft so John now is responsible for pastries the pastry chef and John going to show you how to make all those cookies we're also gonna mix this together so it's nice and light and fluffy next we're gonna add the eggs eggs and vanilla so we use two kinds of flours we use a bread and a pastry flour and that's part of what makes our cookies a little bit unique as well that contributes to the texture and consistency of the cookie this is a dark chocolate 64% we use two bags with us to make of a batch of cookies that's 30 kilos we lift a hundred kilo cookie dough with a forklift from there we have a blowtorch to warm the bowl to loosen up the cookie mix so that it can be removed and added to the hopper the cookie machine will cut 80 cookies a minute from there they are taken in place on trays to be baked after they're baked they are cooled down and wrapped shall we yeah I like this very much okay okay no I love the chocolate - cookie ratio and I love the crispness mm-hmm and the chewiness I love the additional sense of vanilla that I get and this cookie compared to a lot of the other chocolate chip cookies that I've had just in my life in general what about you for me I'm kind of on the same boat with you I love the chocolate like and you just look at this cookie it's just one big big mama glob of chocolate Big Mama glob a chocolate right there in the center oh but yeah I really really love this if I could just want one more thing hazel I would want sweet at all yes see sold on top definitely see salt on top that will make this cookie like ten times better and a little softer on the inside I love a crispy exterior but I want something a little softer inside our second stop is Dominique and sell bakery chef and sell is a revered pastry chef famous for his creative takes on classic desserts his take on the chocolate chip cookie is a little unconventional so I create the cookie shot a few years ago now when I was invited at South by Southwest to create something for for the show I created the cookie shot and at the time it was just for one day and it got so popular I had to bring you back to New York it was a great cookie shot like some it was cold milk and then it was a warm cookie with chocolate inside so I think it was a really nice place I've never had a chocolate chip cookie with this before I think the cookie shot is simply simple it's something that is easy to understand it's fun and it's a great way to experience Takashi cookie the cookie shot is one of our best sellers and to this way to eat the cookie is actually to serve it warm add the vanilla milk inside have a sip of the milk from the out of the cookie and then take a bite of the cookie so first we use a silicone mold that is hollow in the center and here we have our rectangle of dough so we use Valona chocolate chips in our cookies we'll take this dough and we push it inside the mall all the way down and then we'll close off the top once it comes out of the oven we let them cool then we'll line them with our chocolate in the center to make sure that the sip the milk doesn't seep out and then we pour the milk infused with vanilla in a son of the cookie so the cookie is hot and the milk is ice-cold so fun really fun what you enjoy it have you ever seen a chocolate chip cookie fashioned in this way I've seen a lot of things in my 26 years of life can't say that this is one of the things I've seen so you know genius is this cream right it's pretty freakin genius all right shall we yep let's go to tears oh it's soft yeah when really there's so many different ways that you could go to town on this thing but he suggested taking that sip and then taking a bite of that cookie and it's that perfect bite of like cookie to milk when you take a bite of it after drinking the milk you have that kind of mushy cookie thing that you get with when you dip it and not for a while yeah when the cookie itself it's just a solid delicious cookie it's not just like a fun way of presenting a chocolate chip cookie this is a solid chocolate chip cookie I loved that milk that's like mixed in with that she shouldn't vanilla and the sugar and I just wanted more of that that is my only critique otherwise chocolate chip cookie every time you take a bite of this thing ideal bite [Music] our third stop is levin bakery it's well known for its massive cookies and has won countless awards from near and far levin bakery is most known at this point for our cookies and most known for the chocolate chip walnut is our most popular cookie i think it's a classic cookie that's people love this is my very first time at the baby my daughter has been telling me non-stop that we have to get one of these cookies where the lines are long at the bakery they move really quickly which is great aline is great as long as it's moving it's usually about 15 or 20 minutes after we realized that they were a hit then we started kind of playing with the recipe a little bit more took us about a year to get it exactly how we wanted it but no really big changes we get to people to get the bowl because it's so big and heavy with all that dough and carried over the table we weigh each cookie by hand to be sure that it's six ounces every location makes everything freshly each day and what we don't sell we donate at night every cookie that you get when you come to levin bakery is probably gonna be less than an hour out of the oven they have this cookie recipe too with science and their whole objective is to have this crunchy like crispy exterior and then the inside should be like molten kind of still gooey on the inside okay okay how is it do you like it I'm sure this thing is chock full of chocolate chips okay it's literally maybe like an inch in wet it is um you see the interior hmm what is the reason why this place is so popular this cookie for B checks off all boxes the textures are right the chocolate chips are just literally speckled throughout the cookie and there's like a hint of nuts I seriously just don't see yet how any cookie could compare to this this is gonna be really hard to beat our last stop mama this Cafe slash bakery slash restaurant is home to the nutty chocolate chip cookie the cookies are so popular that my mom makes around 3,000 cookies to last for just two days so for those of you who don't know my mom means mother in French and we named it that as a tribute to our mothers who our biggest influence in the kitchen so my husband and I opened up my mom in October of 2014 we opened it up kind of selfishly we wanted to kind of create a space that embodied wonderful home cooking and a beautiful home inspired environment deliver across the road so this is kind of like my local coffee shop and this the cookies are amazing especially the chocolate chip cookie it's like a really like homemade cookie like it's definitely like freshly made but the chocolate in the cookie is just you know really really good and just melts in your mouth so our nutty chocolate chip cookie is one of our most classic dishes and the best dish that we're known for here at my mom so we really wanted to mix that classic chocolate chip cookie with the buttery salty nutty essence that the French culture offers so we've had quite a bit of notoriety on our nutty chocolate chip cookie and our claim to fame was back in 2017 for the holiday season Oprah put it on one of her favorite things one batch made 3,000 cookies and that normally lasts for two days so this sort is from a small city in as west of France and is closer and more soldiers and the table sort so that it's one of the ingredients who makes the cookie very special next we combined together all of the nuts making sure we're using full salted almonds macadamia nuts and walnuts and next up the chocolate to make sure there's a gooey chocolate piece within each bite we use 61% Guittard chocolate wafers okay so I'm not like that chocolate chip expert here but this already has gained 5,000 points do you know why oh it's a positive okay - mine is a positive because this cookie is mostly chocolate this chocolate chip cookie definitely has more chocolate than the other ones we have tried all right let's dig in wait first I'm breaking oh my god okay like there's barely any room for the actual cookie up in here let's just appreciate first it's like you're melting out okay there's not one a basic bite in this cookie I am big on desserts that aren't just straight sugar I feel like I just that really isn't too sweet no no it's like the nuts and the salt balance it perfectly but it's not like a salty cooking no not at all I'm trying to find like any negative I can he really can I don't know I'm like but this might be a really hard one to decide which was the best and now it's time to decide which cookie is the best of the best so unfortunately Alana our journey to find the best chocolate chip cookie is finally over so many good ones I know it's so many good ones but it's time to pick the best chocolate chip cookie in your city are you ready don't look don't look I already have an inkling of an idea of where you're gonna pick one two three I knew it as much as I am disappointed in your answer I want to know what your reasoning is okay so when I have them on my cookie first thing off the bat it's the chocolate every single bite my mouth was just covered in chocolate the nuts in the cookie just had this wonderful crunch great textural component so for the exact reasons that you just explained I did not pick them all for that specific really it was a delicious cookie don't get me wrong but I picked the vent because it checked off all the marks it's crispy on the outside it's molten and gooey on the inside you're still getting globs of chocolate every time you bite into it it's just there are two iconic cookies in their own way if we're talking about my favorite cookie I'm gonna say my mom but if we're gonna be objective the price is just you know they're about the same and you get more cookie with Lavinia the lines out the door is just another thing that I think like symbolizes New York City and that so if you're talking about the best chocolate chip cookie in New York City it is Levesque I hate being wrong but I guess for this one time I'll have to consider more episodes here I just thought of how many times I am going to be or whatever all right I will say for this the best of the best cookie is liveable the bang I don't know so there you have it Levin the winner they're saying all four of these places were fantastic but I want to know do you agree with me or do you agree with Alana or do you think there's another cookie place we should visit let us know in the comments section below Oh", "6h3uLXZjHb8": "hey guys it's Peeta welcome today we're gonna make chocolate chip walnut oatmeal cookies they're absolutely my favorite and they're gonna be your favorite after you try this recipe you're not going to need any other cookie recipe well that's not true I'm sure you're gonna still love all your favorite cookies but this is really my favorite cookie recipe and that's why it's the first cookie recipe that I'm bringing to you guys it's it holds a special place in my heart because that's actually this cookie is what made me like cookies I am gonna get a lot of flack for this I'm sure but I am NOT a cookie person but I love these cookies so much that it turned me on to chocolate chip cookies first thing that we're gonna put into these cookies and it's a One Bowl recipe super super easy really I sometimes get this craving for them and husband really likes these cookies too and I'll just whip them up real quick and they're chewy and they're delicious and there's a lot going on but they're simple at the same time so I have two sticks of butter that I made sure was softened and I'm gonna go ahead and add a cup a cup and 1/4 a tightly tightly packed brown sugar brown sugar actually the molasses in it helps soften the cookie or give it its chew and so if you just substitute white sugar for this you're not gonna get that chewy chocolate chip cookie that you say everybody loves you know white sugar half a cup two eggs right into the mix and we're gonna put in two teaspoons pure vanilla extract all right so next thing we're gonna add is the dry ingredients 1 and a half cups of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and just put it right on top of the flour because then after we add the salt which is this teaspoon it gives the salt gives it a little bit of a little extra you know every sweetness needs a little saltiness to balance it out and so here is no exception so it's one take one take one teaspoon and you can add less but I like that when I have you know that's why salted caramel is so popular because you have something very rich and very deep and and sweet and you want something to balance it out and that salt give us a little bit of a nice zing where you think that's a good pairing so your your taste buds know okay so what I do actually what I do right there is I add the flour and then the salt and the baking soda and then I sort of just mix the dry ingredients just barely whatever just so I know that there that the salts not just in one spot that the baking soda is not just in one spot because the next step you don't want to over beat you just want to barely incorporate and then start a little bit we're gonna add the chopped walnuts three cups of oats more or less so this is two cups almost perfect and then two cups milk chocolate so yeah I like the milk chocolate much better than the dark chocolate because even though this can this cookie is simple there is like I said a lot going on and so you don't want to I don't know for my taste buds I don't want it to be too too rich and too heavy and just it's it just gives a gentler smoother flavour I think boys make a mess when I bake always who cares okay just gonna incorporate this well and then put it on to my baking sheet alright so now that we have this beautiful dough beautiful cookie dough gonna take golf ball more or less like a golf ball shape um cookie dough and throw it right onto an ungreased cookie sheet sometimes I make them bigger sometimes I want them bigger sometimes I want them smaller but so these are maybe maybe a little bigger than a golf ball but they're not gonna flatten out too much they're gonna keep their form but not you know you're not gonna have a ball for a cookie for dessert uh-huh but it's gonna they're not going to be little thin cookies either they're gonna be nice and chewy and thick and delicious and then so just I'm gonna keep doing this and then we're gonna pop them into the oven like I said 325 15 minutes these are so pretty look that beautiful shape happy looking cookies okay so I got them onto the cooling rack and I'm gonna give it a try because I can't wait and warm cookies are always the best these are gonna be hot though and I'm gonna burn myself but for you guys I'll burn myself lovely and I love these things so gorgeous and just they're asking just take a big bite out of me whoops another bite little of them these are the best cookies guys go home try it if you're already at home try it now go to the store get the stuff that you need or maybe you already have most the stuff at home you you just any I need another bet make them please excuse me make these

these awesome chocolate chip cookies filled with the delicious Nutella filling and if you want to make homemade Nutella head on over a rock and Robin's cooking check out the video and subscribe because she's gonna show you how to make this at home the first step is to take a stick of butter and this is at room temperature so I'm just going to add this to a bowl followed by 2/3 of a cup of sugar then I'm going to take my mixer and beat this until it's fluffy and creamy after that go ahead and add in a couple of eggs a teaspoon of vanilla extract and once again we're going to take our mixer here and beat it until it's smooth and well incorporated now we're going to go ahead and work on our dry ingredients and to do this we're going to add two cups of flour to a separate bowl followed by a teaspoon of baking soda take your whisk and mix until it's well combined because the last thing you want is a big mouthful of baking soda once you've done that add 1/2 of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients then you're going to take your spatula and fold it in at the second half of the dry ingredients and continue to fold until you get a smooth mixture with no obvious lumps of flour okay now we're going to add in a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and gently pull them into the batter then culture cookie trayvis in baking spray what I'm going to do now is scoop up all I'd say about a tablespoon of the cookie dough place it in the palm of my hand and press down and flatten it out until I kind of get like a three-inch bitty pancake after that we're going to scoop up oh I'd say about a teaspoon of the Nutella and place this delicious goodness into the center of the dough what I'm doing now is grabbing all the edges and kind of folding them towards the center Pynchon shot until the nutella is sealed and entirely covered once you've done that go ahead and put them on the cookie tray and it doesn't matter if their seam side down seam side up same difference now these are a fairly large cookie and that's what I like but if you want them a little smaller use a little less cookie dough so what we're gonna do is slip these into a 350 degree preheated oven and bake them for about twelve to fourteen minutes while the cookies are baking don't forget to subscribe and never miss a video after about 14 minutes our cookies are done and they smell ever so delicious so we're just going to go ahead and transfer these to a wire rack and allow them to cool a little bit and there you have it our Nutella chocolate chip cookies when you crack these open you

chip and oatmeal cookies they're easy to make and are absolutely delicious you can view the ingredients list and full written method for this recipe on the recipe page on my website I leave links at the end and under the video or just click on the eye icon top right of the screen before I go any further I'd like to give a quick shout out to this week's patreon and PayPal donators and they are Gerald Morgan Frank Pell Linda Thompson Gary Ford and finally Judy and gram Thomas and once again thank you for you continued support everyone it really does help keep the channel going ok for this recipe you'll need a couple of baking tray lined with parchment paper and this is the size of the trays arm using a good way of keeping the paper flat is to rub a little butter here in there time to pre-heat your oven to 190 degrees Celsius that's 375 Aaron hight on gas mark 5 I'm setting mine to 170 because my oven spun assisted and it runs about 20 degrees hotter than indicated on the dial right I'll start the recipe by adding the sugars under butter to a bowl and cream Norse together until you have a nice smooth paste and this job is much easier if your butter is at room temperature you can't of course use a stand mixer to do this pot if you are using a stand mixer use the puddle attachment and keep the speed slow you won't be able to use an electric hand mixer for this as the finished cookie door will be way too thick for a handheld machine don't forget you can view the ingredients list and full written method on the recipe page on the website now add the vanilla extract and the egg and once again make sure your egg is at room temperature or make your butter go hard [Music] now mix those together until you have a nice smooth butter [Music] [Music] [Music] next add all of the dry ingredients starting with the flour try to use these rolled oats if you can they give the finished cookie a great texture but if you can only get instant oats that's okay too when it comes to adding the baking powder push it through a sieve to avoid any of those little hard lumps getting into the mix for the chocolate chips I'm using half white and half dark chocolate but you can use all milk all white or all dark it's entirely up to you [Music] now give that a quick fold then art one tablespoon of honey I'm guessing - its Asia to squeeze it straight from this bottle the honey adds a little flavor but also gives the cookie a slightly sticky texture but you don't need much writer fold a lot together until everything is combined into a sticky mass of cookie dough [Music] okay you can either guess the size of each cookie or you can do it the correct way by Wayne and dividing the door equally know if your measurements were correct at the start your door should wear around 750 grams that's 26 and a half ounces okay I've divided that weight by 12 cookies that that gives me a weight of 62 grams each now an imperial weight that's two point two ounces so I hope you can see it's much simpler to work in grams on your digital scales I'm not free Qing I'm just saying once you get it weighed off roll it into a ball in the palm of your hands and press it down slightly into a puck shape about 13 millimeters that's half an inch thick place six cookies on each tree equally spaced apart I like to use this scoop with this sticky dough [Music] [Music] they look a bit small at the moment but once they're cooked they'll have doubled in size once they're on the trace place them into the preheated oven and set a timer for 13 minutes [Music] once the times up place the trays on wire racks for 10 minutes [Music] after the 10 minutes the cookies will have hardened enough to get them off the tray and the paper but leaving them on the wire racks or the air can circulate around them and leave them to completely cool now you can call these done if you want or you can continue along with me and turn a good cookie into a great cookie by decorating them right what a half here is a hundred gram bar of cheap white chocolate and I'm going to melt it but to make sure it sets hard again on the cookie I'll have to temper it and without getting into complicated temperatures and thermometers this is probably the easiest way of doing it first I'll break off 2/3 of the chocolate and break it into smaller squares and get them into a small stainless steel bowl next I'll cut the remaining third into even smaller pieces and put those in a separate container FDF do not get a little water into a small saucepan and bring it to a boil place the larger ball of chocolate on the pan and turn off the heat and melt the chocolate once it's completely melted take it off the pan altogether [Music] now add the smaller bits of chocolate to the ball and stir it until it's all melted this is called seeding the chocolate and what this does is ensures that the chocolate will set hard again once it cools if we didn't do this process the chocolate will just stay soft on the cookie right it's now ready to use okay each cookie should take about 1 TSP of melted chocolate I'll start with one so you can see how it's done first I'll add a teaspoon of chocolate to the top of the cookie um with clean hands just spread it out with your finger until the top surface is covered with a thin coat of chocolate I'll get it back onto the wire rack and not chocolate should set in about 10 minutes okay I'll crack on with the rest of them you could use a pastry brush to do this but the heat of your hands keeps the chocolate melted right that's then done and once again you can call it done or knock it up another notch by putting a nice design on the top for this I'm using these little cappuccino coffee stencils I'll leave a link on the website recipe page where I get them they are very cheap and very handy in the kitchen for all sorts of applications and this is only two out of the pack of sixteen designs and once again are not being sponsored and I'll be using dark cocoa powder to make the pattern and to make the pattern all I'm doing is sifting cocoa powder through this little tea strainer it works great and doesn't that look nice [Music] and this one's my favorite the bitter coffee cup with the heat waves coming out the top very cool design and if you're clever you know you can make your own stencils by cutting designs out of cardboard or paper and now let's have a look on the inside and as you can see they have a nice soft texture but still crispy around the edges best of both worlds right now for the most important part of the whole process what does it taste like and I can assure you they are fantastic the Ortz give the cookie are fabulous texture and the only way I can describe this is moreish old fashioned word but it sums these cookies up perfectly

recipe for you one of you guys message me a while ago and requested this and I gotta say I'm sorry for the delay but with my busy schedule I'm finally getting around to it so I'm gonna make Michelle Obama's winning chocolate-chip cookies but I'm gonna veganize them the vegan zombie all right so let's just jump right in this is a very simple recipe I found a really easy way to veganize it so we're gonna start out with I have a cup and a half which is three sticks of vegan butter you can really use any vegan butter you like and you want that to be room temperature as you can see I can mash it up pretty easy and the next thing we need is some granulated sugar I got this Organic woman's brain sugar and we're gonna need three quarters of a cup i ball that next we're gonna need some brown sugar there's several brown sugars out there that are vegan I grab the dominoes and if you're in my area and you're Domino's sugar comes from Yonkers New York it is vegan it's not processed through bone char you guys are wondering on other sugars and what sugars are vegan and what sugars aren't I will post my video on that below to help you guys out there this is also a non-gmo sugar you're gonna want three-quarters of a cup and you're gonna pack it in nice and tight BAM all right you got your sugars in there you got your butter I never said this was going to be a healthy recipe this is just gonna be a veganized Michelle Obama's winning chocolate chip cookie recipe I have a teaspoon of salt I also have a teaspoon of baking soda and I'm just kind of kind of fold this all in incorporate it like so you want your oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit this recipe doesn't take long at all all right once your make sure it looks like this we're gonna make our vegan egg replacer now for this recipe I'm using an actual egg replacer and I know in a in a previous video I talked about Bob's Red Mill I really like this but this one right here is already open and it works really well and we need two eggs to replace and we're not going to use real eggs because that's gross so for every egg it's gonna be one tablespoon of this I replace or powder followed by two tablespoons of warm water so via two eggs that means two tablespoons of the egg replacer and then we need two tablespoons of the warm water I just like to put the warm water in a cup and then one two three four or a quarter cup and then we're just gonna whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk and you'll see it start to thicken up and then with a little spatula here I'm just gonna get all of it out of there right into the bowl all righty it's looking good and then we have one teaspoon of vanilla extract we're just gonna mix that together there's the consistency and at this point we need some flour so I have some all-purpose unbleached flour it's got beyond it for vegan we're gonna open that up and we are gonna put two and 1/4 of a cup of flour in there and I'm just gonna use this info bar I'm not gonna go by weight one two and a four now I made this earlier today or when I was testing the recipe and at first I thought it was too thick and I would need to put in some like vegan milk or some maple syrup or something but nope this is a perfect recipe these are the perfect measurements and it all works so you're just gonna fold that in incorporate it in just like we did earlier if you have a KitchenAid or mixer go ahead and use that put it on like a slowest speed and mix it together we don't have those in the zombie apocalypse and we do but all this work you don't works your arms out you know so you can get some exercise while you're making something that's not quite good for you but they're not Michelle Obama's winning cookies for nothing I should have sent her this recipe so you know for 2020 she can be more conscious of the environment and more compassionate you know vegan cookies we have the dough all mixed out now we need our chocolate chip because it's chocolate chip recipe so this calls for not just regular chocolate chips but three different kinds this isn't a winning chocolate chip cookie recipe for nothing semi-sweet chocolate chips he says just the Wegmans brand it's a vegan it has the viana right there but you can find other vegan chocolate chips and stores enjoy life has a few other brands have vegan chocolate chips so so here's a cup one couple of these throw that in there but we don't stop there because Michelle Obama didn't she also has mint chocolate chips I couldn't find mint chocolate chips but I did find some mint vegan chocolate so we need one cup that smells good give it a rough chop don't drop your fingers off alright we need a cup of these so that's roughly a cup I'm gonna I'm just gonna put that in if you want a whole cup you probably have another quarter of this one but I'm not going to open it right there and then she also put some white chocolate chips in there and I gotta say I just found these at Wegmans I have not tried them yet it's called Pasha organic and they are reading certified white chocolate chips I can't say anything good about the price because they were very pricey when you can find some other vegan white chocolate in fact what I was going to do before I found these was use this vegan white chocolate I was just gonna cut this up to like I just did the mint so I follow these are white nuts let me try one it's good and we need to call these oh my god that's like almost six bucks worth now we have all of the ingredients that we need right in this bowl no we don't we don't she also puts walnuts in it two cups of walnuts chopped walnuts I love walnuts I could sit there and snack on walnuts all day but for some reason I don't like walnuts when they're cooked into baked goods brownies or cookies or whatever I don't like them anymore and that's because of an experience that I had when I was a kid so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna mix these together and then I'm gonna take some of the dough and we're gonna put some of those walnuts in there so we have an authentic Michelle Obama cookies look at that this is like pure deliciousness but not nutritious nests don't make these every don't even make these every week make these like I don't know maybe once a year once a year come back to this video and say I'm gonna make these delicious cookies so everybody thinks that I am a master chef or a baker smells like magical cookies now the recipe calls for two cups of chopped walnuts but I'm just gonna take I don't know about 3/4 of a cup of walnuts walnut something is good for you in here you got your omegas fold those in I like to say that we're folding them in no not all these are nutritious you're gonna need a cookie sheet you can use parchment paper or what I like to do when I open the butter is I take the little butter sealing packages thing and I rub it all over the tray like I did over there so it won't stick and you're just gonna take little balls of the dough about that big depending on how big you want your cookie but this is how I did earlier space them out a little bit like I am here so they don't form together I mean you could have made one big cookie or you could make cookie brownies like a big tray of cookies my mom used to do that when I was younger I think that was just like hey I don't feel like waiting here while the cookies bake I'm just gonna make one big thing really quick anyone hear a funny story while I'm putting the same trick when I was little I used to always sneak I mean what kid didn't try to sneak a lick of the cookie dough and my mom didn't like it when I did that you know she got mad at me and then she'd always make cookies but she would never so that probably explains why she would make the big one later on but she would always make dough to make cookies but then she wouldn't make them all so she'd have leftover dough like this wrap it up put it in the refrigerator and I would always like wait for her to take a nap or what you know I was pretty young I was less than 10 years old and I would like open the refrigerator and sneak it you know get a nice amount she would always find out she'd be like Christopher because you know there was fingerprints in it like that she knew but one day I saw the container it was a Tupperware container does she always put the cookie dough in I was set on getting some of that cookie dough so she was taking a nap or something well she wasn't looking at maybe she was vacuuming downstairs I don't remember but she was busy and I went for my chance I opened the freezer and I opened it up and as I was looking down the hallway I stuck my fingers in there and I've put it in my mouth and I was like oh my god it was disgusting it was disgusting because it wasn't cookie dough it was frozen gravy and this is way before I was vegan so I just I just had a mouthful of frou and gravy and I can still remember the taste it was disgusting anyways these are done well there as far as Brady go in the oven we're gonna put them in the oven for about 12 minutes it could vary depending on where you are you know where you are your elevation the temperature of your oven I know know at Craigs oven is very low temperature so you put on 375 it's not really 375 you got to crank that up to like 400 we learned the hard way when we make pot pie at his house I have it at 375 12 minutes seems to work perfect for these so I'll see you at 12 all right so that's what the finished product look like they look delicious they smell delicious and I just want to show you guys I left these ones in for a little bit longer than 12 minutes they're still good but they're a little bit darker and a little bit crispier than the 12 minute ones so this is the perfect time to make the perfect cookies 12 minutes they just they look so good and I'm not gonna taste one because of the walnuts and also because I want to stay in shape and I may have already had one earlier when I tested the recipe so all right fine I'll have one minty chocolaty delicious but it's missing something perfect Michelle Obama's winning chocolate-chip cookies veganized I kind of made up my own recipe the fudge don't come after me well it was worth it so if you guys liked this video give it a thumbs up subscribe if you're not already and if you're wondering about these aprons you can get them right on my

out for zombies it's like 6:00 in the morning I'm going to bed [Music] you", "Ed3c0vGCx0c": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate cookies first pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius and lying to baking sheets with parchment paper or you could butter or just spray them with a nonstick vegetable spray and then in the bowl of if you have an electric stand mixer with the paddle attachment or you could use a just electric hand mixer with a large bowl I'm going to place a half a cup that's 113 grams of butter that's at room temperature I like to use unsalted because I like the flavor but better plus I like to control the amount of salt in the recipe so I'm just going to beat that until it's creamy and smooth okay scrape down the sides and now I'm going to add a quarter of a cup that's 50 grams of white granulated sugar and a half a cup that's about 105 grams of light brown sugar and I'm just going to beat that for a minute or a couple minutes just until light and fluffy strike down the sides here to this I'm going to add one large egg and one teaspoon of vanilla extract try to use a pure because I was wait a lot more flavor than the imitation ones and I'm just going to beat that until it's all smooth okay now in a large bowl here we're going to mix together all our dry ingredients I have 1 cup of all-purpose flour that's what 130 grams I'm going to add to that 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and just a pinch of salt but 1/8 of a teaspoon now if you use salted butter just leave the salt out now and over top I'm going to sift in 1/4 of a cup that's about 25 grams of unsweetened cocoa powder now I like the flavor of the Dutch processed cocoa powder in this recipe because as a mild chocolate flavor but I know Dutch process cocoa powder can be hard to find so if you can't find it then just use a regular unsweet unsweetened cocoa powder okay so set that to remove any lumps and then I'm just going to whisk the cocoa powder into the flour I'm just going to beat that until it's incorporated when it's almost fully mixed together just scrape down the sides and then to that I'm going to add one and a half cups that suppose three 260 grams of either white chocolate chips like I have here or you could just cut up a white chocolate bar if you have that into chunks either way I've usable 1/2 cups now if you'd like to use a little less than that a cup that would be fine the white chocolate adds a really nice sweet flavor plus it the the white looks really nice against the dark chocolate batter now because we just used a little but a quart of a cup of cocoa powder it colors the batter very nice a nice chocolate brown but it does it adds a chocolate flavor but it's a mild chocolate flavor okay so we're done as you can see that's easy batter to whip up now I like to to form the cookies I like to use an ice cream scoop this is about 1/2 tablespoons if you don't have this you could just use 2 spoons that's fine as well but this makes really quick work of forming the cookies and also every cookie is exactly the same size which so it bakes you they all bake evenly in it for the same amount of time so I'm just going to join these a couple inches apart on the baking sheet okay now a couple things about this recipe if I didn't want to bake this recipe makes about 20 to 24 cookies if I didn't want to bake these all I could just freeze the unbaked cookies just take this baking I could take this baking sheet put it in the freezer when these the cookies are frozen then you could just take them all put them in a plastic freezer bag and then just bake them on demand but I'm going to bake them all today so we're going to bake them about 8 to 10 minutes just until the outsides are firm but the insides are still soft so into the oven they go our cookies are now done so you can see the outside around the edges is quite firm but if I push the center as you can see they're still quite soft they're quite fragile right now so let them cool in the pan for about five minutes and then transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling you can cover and store these at room temperature for several days so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "m5hrrzbyl9Y": "Oh hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm gonna share with you my recipe for my chunky chocolate peanut butter cookies they're so good and could not be easier to make so let's go over the ingredients so we can get started you'll need some all-purpose flour some plain greenish sugar brown sugar semi-sweet chocolate chips unsalted butter at room temperature some creamy peanut butter one egg baking soda salt vanilla extract and these are some salted peanuts that I've just chopped up roughly you don't need to be precise about that but that's a total optional ingredient I just love the combination of like salty and sweet and I think because these are peanut butter cookies by adding in the salted peanuts that's my favorite part about this cookie so first thing you want to do is get your oven nice and hot to 375 and then take some baking sheets line them with parchment paper and now we're just going to get right into the cooking I'm making this in my big standing mixture but you can just as easily do this recipe with a bowl and a regular old wooden spoon or a whisk or spatula does not you don't need any fancy equipment to cook remember that so in here I'm going to cream together both kinds of sugar with my butter this will take about a minute or so one until it's fully creamy and looks good we're going to add in my egg and my vanilla I'm just going to mix ounce once incorporated and while that's going I'm going to do really quick please I'm going to take my flour and my baking soda in my salt and I'm going to just mix these really really quickly together just because I don't want to get like one big lump of salt and one big lump of baking soda that's good and now this is almost why I wanted but not quite yet so I'm just going to give it another few seconds that looks good I'm just going to give us my mix here with my spatula because remember sometimes it doesn't always incorporate everything as look as well as I like it too so just take the spatula and just run it on the sides of the mixer of the bowl but now we're going to add in my creamy peanut and and this is just an optional thing you can always buy chunky peanut butter and completely forget about the peanuts I just like to use smooth peanut butter in salted peanuts because they have that extra but you know extra flavor from the salt and it's just so I could anything like me where you love the combination of sweet salty then these cookies are right up your alley so just mix in the peanut butter and just mix everything together until you have a nice smooth mixture that's perfect so now I'm going to turn this off I'm going to add in my dry ingredients and I'm just going to mix this enough so that the dry ingredients are incorporated but like I always say you just don't want to over mix it otherwise you're gonna end up with such a tough cookie I always giggle when I say that the cookies gonna end up being so tough and it won't be like a nice chewy fluffy cookie so I'm just gonna literally mix this until I can no longer see the flour that's perfect so I'm just gonna add in a chocolate chips now whoa and my peanuts and just mix this for a few seconds that's it doesn't take very very long and you don't want to over mix it that's just be number one key when it comes to baking unless you're making bread or a you know pizza dough or a pretzel there's something that does need a long time for it to need you know because you want that consistency then you want the texture to be chewy and you know not hard but you know what I mean like right like you don't want that make sure your might you don't want your cookies or your cakes it tastes like that so just give everything just a mix with my spatula that looks combined enough and now we're just going to go into rolling these bad boys now I'm only going to make a dozen tonight because she's my husband I and I want to bake the whole thing because chances are we would eat them so these is a great dough to freeze just put it in like plastic containers with a tight-fitting lid pop it in the freezer and then freeze them and if you want to defrost them right away put them in the put the batter the frozen batter in the microwave for 30 seconds and then it's perfectly ready and scoopable I do it all the time so now I'm going to do of course is take my little handy dandy ice cream scoop and put these on some parchment paper lined baking sheets put them a couple inches apart from each other because these will spread out just a little bit that's one now using your fingers or fork I'm just going to Pat these down just like so you can also use just use your hands of course these look great this one needs a bit more now these are gonna go into my preheated oven at 375 for about 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges or lightly golden brown the middle will not be completely set but that's because they will set as they cool and then after their cup they're cooked you want to let them cool completely and that will serve them my cookies baked for about 8 minutes I mean they bake really really quickly and then just let them cool completely I'm just going to go straight into one but I want the one with the most chocolate chips so you know I'm going after this one it's just peanuts that's the bomb the bomb diggity dog mmm what a delight salty sweet chocolaty chewy crunchy what's the definition of like the perfect cookie I have enjoyed spending time with me I'm going to go embarrass myself by eating at least three or four of these and I'll see you next time get this recipe nah go www Laura in the kitchen comm see ya", "za9xPzQ6MQo": "hey guys welcome back to my channel i know it's been a while since i last posted a cooking or baking video we've just been super busy with life and everything else on the side but anyways we're back and today we're going to be baking some red velvet cookies okay no more talking let's start so we're going to start off by just prepping the flour mixture [Music] once that's done we're going to move on we're going to go and beat the butter with eggs and the sugar okay so now we are going to beat the butter with the sugar we're going to beat this on medium speed until it's nice and creamy is so after all this is combined we're gonna swap to low speed and we're gonna add the flower mix [Music] slowly [Music] when i go to sleep at night the last ingredient to this recipe before we start baking is the white chocolate chips okay so we're just gonna scatter that in and then we're gonna slowly fold to make sure that it's spread it out nice and even so every cookie that you bite into you get this bit of white chocolate inside that is looking good before we bake these we're going to cover it and chill it in the fridge for four hours it only takes like 14 minutes to bake you can prepare this overnight i'm gonna bake it the next day but i prefer just to make it in the morning and then bake it in the afternoon okay i'll see you in a minute [Music] hey hey all right it's been four hours the cookie dough has been resting in the fridge we're going to prepare our cookies also preheat the oven so it's 160 degrees what i have here is half a cup of granulated sugar and half a cup of icing sugar powdered sugar okay and i also have this um fry light like light butter just to grease my hands so the cookie doesn't stick too okay right let's do this so we're gonna roll these balls out to around one and a half inch balls and we're gonna place them on the baking tray two inches apart so you're just gonna roll them out like that i love this stuff guys it's so good i use it to make like pancakes and waffles and stuff okay so you're gonna roll it out like that you see it's not sticking to your hands and then you're gonna roll it in the granulated sugar and then you're gonna bring it over to the icing sugar and roll it lots first batch of cookies is ready to go in the oven we're going to bake these for 13 to 14 minutes depending on how hot your oven is i'll just double check these around 13 minutes to make sure that they're not burned okay all right oh and guys i forgot to tell you that halfway through so around seven minutes make sure not to forget to rotate the baking tray so the heat is distributed evenly throughout all the cookies and they're all baked properly around 13-14 minutes you should start to see the cookies kind of like puff up and the top should be cracked for doing this right um so it should crack and then um the thighs should set a little so you know that they're kind of ready okay let's see if this is gonna work [Music] all right we'll let them rest for 10 minutes on the baking tray and then when we transfer them over to the cooling rack we'll just have a little bite [Music] i'm going to try [Music] that guys it's like very gooey and chewy and moist and the outside's so crunchy oh wow oh wow these are yum oh my god my new favorite cookie there we go red velvet cookies guys i think my cocoa powder was quite dark that's why the color red is not really popping but usually with ingredients that i've given you guys it should be a little bit more red than brown but it doesn't really matter because it tastes super good and yeah i think these are my new favorite cookies i think i like them more than my chocolate chip cookies hope you guys enjoy see you later [Music] [Applause] butterflies when i go to sleep at night", "tDiyxE9shN0": "just so that the essential tip to make sure that we come out by like nice and softly hey guys come back to my channel so today I'm going to be doing my cookie recipe so these are my cookies I like really soft they're quite big they're really soft they're really like gooey on the inside so I'm going to show you all the tips and tricks on how I keep my cookies daily soft for the next day in the fall and day and whoever lonely lost in your house I have got a couple of tips to keep them like nice and soft moist and yeah so often I've been on a bread recipe I thought I could do a cookie recipe I will link my banana bread recipe up above and below but yeah I thought I'd start with the smaller things with everything that's going on at the moment I'm not really gonna be making sort of like massive big cakes and decorating them so eventually I will be doing that but for now I'll just be showing you how I make my cookies so I will show you everything that you will need okay so this is everything that you will need so you will need a bowl the spatula just so you can get the edges I always recommend using a spatula when you're baking because it just really gets everything on the side and just feel also needs like a small whisk or mixer and we will need some scales and then onto ingredients so you're going to need 200 grams of butter you will need 300 grams of caster sugar at the moment I only have granulated sugar so that's just what I'm gonna go with right now you're going to need 325 grams of flour you may need a dash of milk depending on the consistency of your mixture but we shall see you will need one large egg and then you will need 200 grams of white chocolate and 200 grams of milk chocolate and you can adjust the chocolate ratio quarter how much you want so tell me I use a bit less than tons of use of it well actually never one but sometimes they use a bit less chocolate if I don't really want that much so the first thing you don't want to do is turn you off and on and set it to 200 degrees so the first thing that you want to do is measure out your butter so I need about 200 grams so I'm just going to get my skills put my bowl on top and make sure that it is on zero so out some zero I need 200 grams of my butter so it should be softened to room temperature to unbundle so this might take a bit longer than I would have hoped for but it should be fine I'll just cut it up into small pieces and it should be okay so usually people mix the bottom on the sugar straight away I personally don't like doing that I mix up the butter by itself whisk it up and completely by itself that way it gets like really light and fluffy you want to make it so it goes from like the yellow yellow color and make it so it goes through like a white whipped color so you need about 200 grams of that so I'm just going to cut off 50 because this is 250 [Music] sorry caught the bottom and how about for disaster so for myself because I have this often determine the temperature I'm just going to cut it up into several pieces so it's easier for it to whisper don't break my work I've done that before don't be that person this might take a few minutes I'm gonna put some white and fluffy [Music] I'm just going to add in the flour so with the flour you want to add it slowly so I'm going to do in three two hookers so you need 325 grams of self-raising flour [Music] getting quite stiff so I think I'm gonna have to add definitely the dash of milk to help the mixer mix it through my - was always a bit too big but it's okay so at this point my mixture is coming together it's not probably I would say which is why I added the dashing milk so it's not currently it's still coming together at this point you need to start using your hand to get it because what it Walter combined and just work together so what I'm going to do is well because I'm not use my hands make sure you have to clean by the way what's your hands at the stop so I'm just going to add in the chocolate now as well so if I add in the chocolate now I can just stop mixing back throughout as well you definitely don't want to add the chocolate whilst you using the mixer because a it's just going to get stuck in the mixer and maybe stop breaking up but you don't want one nice big chocolate chunks so we can use another mixer and I have myself some cherry milk and I have some milky bars or for my white chocolate so 200 grams of each and just stop breaking it off piece by piece and adding it in [Music] so this is what your mixture should start looking like so I have mixed all the flour thorough and all the chocolate has sort of been spread throughout the mixture and now what you're going to need is a tripe but I'm just going to grab about this much mixture any chance for on this tray and i jus wanna make sure this pile of space between them because they do separate out i usually keep my cookies as round balls and then they sort of spread itself so you don't need to do that so i've rolled out about four of the cookies and i still have about that much mix collapse i probably for another fall so in certain you can get about 12 cookies out this and so pop them in the oven at two degrees okay so with the cookies this is the tip the essential tip to make sure that they come out quite like moist and soft so you're going to put them in for exactly ten minutes so i'm just gonna put my timer on myself so I don't forget you want to put them on for 10 minutes and when you take them out of the oven they're gonna look quite soft and they didn't look like they kind of undercooked but that is exactly exactly how they need to be and then you'll leave them on the side for a bit and they'll start cooling and that is when it will just become amazing and delicious and it will still stay cool if you overcook them that's when they start to become quite hard and they're gonna be a bit like crumbly which is still nice to be fair but that's not the type of cookie that were aiming for so if you want to keep them soft just only put them in for 10 minutes maximum I think like 11 or 12 I think I did like 11 and a half minutes once and it was just way too much so if you keep them exactly at 10 minutes that's where you make sure you pre-heat your oven and make sure that it's exactly at 200 degrees once you put the cookies in stop put in about 8 cookies and we will see how it goes ok so it's been around 11 minutes I check up on my cookies they look amazing okay so this is what my cookies look like if anything actually kept importance I kept in 411 because I've got a distracted and now it's the hard part of letting it cool for a bit [Music] as you can see it's quite gooey and soft on the inside and it's gonna have a taste I'll make sure I get a bit of chocolate but it's so that I've definitely done it slightly too much I always trust your instincts this so I mean keep in to ten minutes exactly do not seem to cook any over and these will come out perfectly and gooey and chocolatey on the inside and it's amazing oh I wish the whole bite with the white chocolate so if you do make these cookies you let me know and tag me in the pictures and I hope you've enjoyed my video and give it a like give it a comment subscribe and hope it'll be a lot more baking videos coming up and began icky thanks", "r0hldRvsMKk": "so welcome back everyone if you watched my recent video where I shared with you we baked brownies together yesterday you know that I did some baking which I don't typically do in the summertime and I explained all of that in my video yesterday and I knew as sure as I posted my video there was one individual in particular who will go unnamed Jeanine who was going to enlist me to bake these cookies that she absolutely loves for a meeting that we have tomorrow afternoon and so I figured since I'm going to have to break out the baking pans and turn on the oven again I would share this recipe with all of you because this is actually a really nice delicious cookie that cuts out 85% if not more of the ingredients that are required when you're actually baking true homemade chocolate chip cookies but they have the same taste and they're absolutely wonderful they're absolutely delicious there's very few ingredients involved they're very very simple and everyone that has ever tried them has loved them so they are a cake mix chocolate chip cookie I'm going to share with you today how to make that so the first thing that you want to do is you want to get a yellow cake mix I've got my little recipe card standing up here on my clothespin that used to be my grandmother's she passed away last year and she always used to use this to hold up her recipe cards when she was baking and now I have it so the first thing you're going to need is the yellow box cake mix it doesn't matter what kind just a yellow cake mix that's important don't try to substitute it with a white or a gold or a chocolate it really does need to be a yellow cake mix so the first thing that we're going to do is add in our yellow box cake mix and I think I may just take the bag out this time because yesterday if I dropped the bag into the bowl which I don't normally do so we're gonna add in our cake mix here very simple if you've never had these before and maybe some of you have you know that they're very delicious and they really truly taste just like those homemade chocolate chip cookies that you love the only real significant difference is they do have a real light appearance to them so it calls for one full box of cake mix a half of cup of butter softened here's a trick that I do with my butter first off I don't measure out butter obviously a stick of butter equals the half a cup so I always use a full stick and to soften it while I am preheating my oven I will set the butter on top and then it softens just perfectly and it's not melted because if it's melted it's obviously not going to work the way that the recipe calls for so I don't stick it in the microwave I put it on my oven let it nice and soften and it works perfectly so we're just gonna drop that in there like that and then it calls for one tablespoon of milk so I've measured out my tablespoon of milk here it calls for one teaspoon of vanilla which we have here which I think that elet eight makes everything tastes wonderful and then it calls for one egg put our egg in here and then you know yesterday if you watched my brownie video my box becomes my trashcan and then I dump it in the trashcan it's just easier to pile it all in the box and then pitch it so what we do is we mix these ingredients together before we add the chocolate chips so we'll put our beater on here make sure that's locked into place I certainly don't want that flying off there we go so I'm going to start this on a low speed we'll mix this and then we'll add in our chocolate chips [Music] okay so that's whipped up very nice and very very creamy and we're going to remove the leader here because for the chocolate chips we have to fold those into our mixture you jump we're not going to use the KitchenAid for that so I'll just show you here we have a really nice creamy buttery consistency and so this calls for one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and we're just going to add some of them in and then we'll fold that in and then we'll add in a little bit more I said yesterday I don't mix anything by hand I don't prefer it I do like to use the mixer and I don't like hand mixers I do like to use the Kitchen Aid but in this instance this will most likely chop up some of these chocolate chips so you just Pat it in and then you fold in your chocolate chips just making sure that you're getting everything that's on the sides and that it's nice and folded in and then we'll add in the remainder so I really was not planning on baking anything again any time soon the temperature did drop a little bit here today instead of like 110 I think we're in the 90s which is still too hot to me to have the oven on but she did ask me to make these and so I thought well I guess I will so these are mixed up very nicely and our batter looks really great so I'll share with you here if you can see we've got our chocolate chips in there we've got our batter ready to go so now what we're going to do is place them on our cookie sheet and our cookie sheet should be ungrazed so we have our ungreased cookie sheet and we're going to use our cookie scooper and we're just going to start dishing some of the cookie dough out I like the cookies scoopers because they sort of keep the cookies proportionate so I like that but sometimes not with this recipe but sometimes with cookie dough recipes the cookie scooper sometimes it's so thick the dough that it's really hard to get it out and I don't care for it then I always run it along the side to make it somewhat flat and it makes a really nice round ball on our cookie sheet if you can see that there so it makes a pretty decent sized cookie my scooper does so wipe some of the excess off here and we're just going to continue dropping out our cookie dough [Music] okay so now that we have all of our cookies aligned on our cookie sheet here we're going to bake them for 10 to 12 minutes I typically put them in for about 8:00 and check them and then if they need additional time then I'll go ahead and continue but I don't typically put them in and go directly for the full amount of time so we're going to put these in the oven and we'll be back when they're done so our cookies are baked and out of the oven and as you can see they have this delicious like buttery color to them they don't look like your dark brown traditional chocolate chip cookie they have this really light buttery delicate look to them they're absolutely delicious [Music] so the baking time in my oven was perfect at ten minutes it said anywhere from ten to twelve and ten minutes was the perfect cooking time in our oven so I'm going to transfer these from the cookie sheet to the cooling rack they don't take much time to cool and the thing that I actually really like about this particular recipe is that these cookies are actually really nice and firm so when you are they come right off the cookie sheet totally solid when you bake chocolate chip cookies normal regular chocolate chip cookies oftentimes they even after they cooled some when you're trying to dish them off the pan to a cooling rack they still are a little bit weak these cookies are not so it has to have something something to do with the cake mix versus and these are literally just sliding right off of the pan it has to have something to do with the fact that it's cake mix versus you know traditional making your own flour all of that don't get me wrong I love those but these are so simple and they're going to satisfy the craving of any one who absolutely loves chocolate chips and they're probably going to impress your guests if they've never had them because they're unique and they're yummy and they're delicious and they look lovely and they taste wonderful and as I said they're just so simple the other thing I really like and if you noticed on the pan these cookies do not spread on your pan once you form that ball they stay exactly where they are they don't spread out like sometimes especially when you're doing a larger cookie you will often times find that that cookie will spread into a cookie bar and before you know it you have a giant pan of one big cookie you're trying to separate these don't do that they stay in the exact formation of how you put them on the trade to begin with so there that is very very simple they're absolutely tasty and wonderful and delicious I promise you you cannot tell a difference between these and regular chocolate-chip cookies and if you've never tried them try this recipe it's so simple there's very few ingredients not a lot of time but they taste absolutely wonderful [Music]", "c50BSuTqybA": "[Music] hi guys it's Lindsay and we are making probably the cutest cookie I've ever made with my white chocolate chips funfetti cookies I am literally of passing over how cute these cookies are and if you guys have not already subscribed to my youtube channel be sure to Pat that subscribe button to the first to see my all new videos if you love cookies and you look fun Betty cake you are going to love this recipe the buttery cookie for the hint of sweet spot Betty cake flavor without even using cake mix there's several steps and rainbow sprinkles and the white chocolate chip to make it taste just like frosting on a cake now I use my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe as the base for these but I swapped out white chocolate chips and then I added a little bit of sweet almond extract that add a little bit of that extra cake batter flavor that pairs perfectly with the white chocolate chips to really make these cookies taste like funfetti cake these would be so perfect for a birthday party a shower any celebration so into a bowl we add 10 tablespoons of unsalted softened butter 2/3 cup of packed dark brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar and we're just going to beat this on medium speed for about 3 minutes until it's light and fluffy then we're going to add one large egg 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract to give us out funfetti cake batter flavor and one and a skew terms of vanilla extract and just beat that right in now we're gonna get the dry ingredients together so in a small bowl just add 1 and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 a teaspoon themselves and just give this a nice little whisk together now we're slowly going to add the flour mixture on low speed until just incorporated and forms a nice dough and now that was the best part we get to add one and a half cups of white chocolate chips and 1/3 a cup of sprinkles all right now we're just going to seduce the dough into balls about 3 tablespoons each onto a baking sheet and we're just going to pop them in the fridge for about 2 hours or you can do this overnight and refrigerating the dough is really important because it allows for all the flavors to develop and give time for the dough to absorb the moisture for a really eautiful hydrated in sperm doe but we don't side too much in the oven alright there's a little bit false about a chance to chill them afraid so now we're going to pop them in a preheated 350 degree fahrenheit oven for about 9 to 12 minutes or until they're just wrap around the edges and nice to golden brown make sure you don't over bake them because we want to keep it nice chewy Center oh my goodness you guys look how cute these turned out we're just going on cool in the baking sheet for 3 to 5 minutes before we transfer to a wire rack to cool completely ok I cannot wait any longer to give these a try mmm that's perfect chewy soft center with the crispy edges and get a little crunch from the sprinkles and the fully gooey white chocolate chips throughout makes it so perfect and the hint of sweet almond and vanilla extract makes it's just like funfetti cake batter now if you're not like me and you don't inhale the entire batch all the ones you can definitely Stirling's in an airtight container at room temperature for a few days or you can freeze them already baked for a few months just make sure you wrap them up well and pop them in the freezer I hope you guys love these cookies as much as I do be sure to head on over to Lindsay and XCOM for the full written recipe and tons more

if you're new or if you're not I'm\nAlyssia and I'm stoked you're here either way. I have surprisingly\nhad a lot of people say can you do a video that\nshows healthy convenience store snacks, like gas stations snacks. I don't know why I'm surprised by this but I kind of thought gas stations and convenience stores\nhave a lot of options. So, I was confused about why\npeople really wanted this video and I started to think about it. I have some thoughts I'm gonna share. But my first thing I would\nadvise when asking yourself this question or asking anyone\nthis question, because you're on the hunt for healthy,\nconvenience source snacks is, why? So really knowing what is your goal and why are you gonna\nthe convenience store, is it because you're on the road? Are you just, you know, driving\nhome from school or what? So if you're on the road,\nwhich is usually when I go to a convenience store or gas station, that was kind of my\napproach to this video, is it because you're on Whole30\nand paleo that it's hard? Is it that you're trying to be healthy? Is it because you're\nafraid of eating bad foods? Are you experiencing some guilt or or are you judging yourself? You know, all of these kinds\nof change the intention behind why you want healthy\nconvenience store snacks and that intention will\nimpact your experience. So if this is a matter of you wanting healthy convenience store snacks\nbecause you're on the road, and any of those other things\nI just listed are true. My next question would be how frequently are you really on the road? Because if this is something\nlike for me, I don't, especially in coronavirus\ntimes, I don't travel a lot. There's not that many\nopportunities that I have to go into a convenience store and find a snack. So when I do, I kind of\nknow it's not forever. And do I really need to get\nso worked up over what it is. Again if I was doing Whole30\nor something, then yeah it would make sense, but you\nsee how this intention matters. So the truth is, it's\nactually not hard at all to find something healthy\nat a convenience store. And if you start with the fridge, that's gonna be your best bet for fresh, you know, regarding healthy. So whole fruit bananas, oranges, apples, you're almost always gonna find those. And in the actual refrigerator section they usually have like\nchopped, fresh fruit. I went to a 7-Eleven for this video and all the snacks I'm\ngonna show you today are from a 7-Eleven, but they\nhad, you know, chopped fruit that was mixed like the box I got here but they also had melons and grapes. They had some chopped salads and you know, a lot of times you can\nalso find like celery with peanut butter or boiled eggs. My store didn't have those but those are things\nyou can typically find in the refrigerator at a gas station. Uh cheese, I also found cheese and you know, prosciutto sticks and baby bells and that kind of stuff. That could be a great source of protein especially if you're\non the road and looking for something that will keep\nyou satisfied for longer. Now, here's what I realized\nas I started to contemplate why do people really want this video? So what's hard walking\ninto a convenience store is not finding something\nhealthy, it's deciding not to get something\nunhealthy, because we walk in and we're exposed to like a\nheaven of processed foods. It's just like so much stimulus. And I just want to eat\nall of these things. And why would I want to\npick up an apple when they have Doritos, you know,\nand all the good stuff. So I think the challenge\nis really mental, right? This is mind over munch. It keeps showing up every day. The challenge is walking\ninto the gas station and choosing something healthy. This is a valid concern and\nshould still be addressed. So if you feel like\nyou're forcing yourself to choose something that you don't want, it might be worth it to\njust pick the thing you want and give yourself permission to eat it. I did an entire video about the power of permission\nwith food last year and I'll link that below\nif that calls to you. If I go to a gas station and I need and I want or need to get a snack I'll first check in with my inner wisdom. If you don't know what\ninner wisdom is check out that video first so you\nknow what I'm talking about but essentially asking in,\ntuning in how hungry am I? Am I hungry? Am I just bored? You know, a lot of times\non road trips, I am bored. It's actually okay to\neat when you're bored and it's okay to eat junk\nfood because you feel like it. The question is what\nresonates with your body and heart and mind in\nthis moment considering the big picture of any health efforts you may be making or setting\nintentions around, right? So if you're like, well right now I'm doing Whole30 specifically to learn about what resonates with my body. Then yeah, it serves you\nto get really intentional. But if you're just like, ah I feel so guilty if I eat that food and it's coming from that\nplace of judgment, I would say take a step back and think\nabout why this matters to you. So after I check in with my inner wisdom then I can work out to the outer wisdom which is like the nutrition knowledge. So when it comes to outer\nwisdom, I personally will look more at ingredients\nof a snack these days in my life than I will\nthe macro nutrients. So the main thing I'll look\nat on the label is added sugar because added sugar provides\nno nutrition at all. Again, that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't or can't eat it. It's just, if I'm trying to\nmake a very intentional choice considering outer wisdom,\nI would personally look at added sugar, for instance,\nover calories or even fat. So throughout this video I'm gonna go through these snacks. The intention was choosing cleaner items. And by clean, I am defining\nclean as less processed, not good. This is not about, you\nknow, morality in food. I like the word clean because\nit just is a quick way to nod to being less processed. If you don't like the word you can replace it with whatever you like. I'm not saying, you know these foods are good in\nthese foods are bad, okay? So what else is there to eat\nat a convenience store besides fruit and cheese if you're\ntrying to make a healthy choice. Also from the fridge section,\nthese Sabra Snackers, okay? I love this. They're crunchy salty, satisfying. You get the protein from the hummus and you kind of get the\nprocessed food from the pretzel. So it's kind of like\nthe best of both worlds but you get a little bit\nof nutrition out of it. Oka, these kind of refrigerated smoothies, this is Mighty Mango Naked. This one, I just pretty much\nlooked in the refrigerator and this was the one\nthat had no added sugar. It does have, you know,\n68 grams of carbohydrates, 57 grams of sugar, but\nit's not added sugar. That being said it is a lot of fruit. I've joked about this\non the channel before when I did a video about\njuices and this has one and a quarter mangoes,\none and three quarters apples a half an orange, a\nthird of a banana, right? Like, would you eat\nthat much fruit at once? Probably not. That being said, it's\nstill a cleaner choice. So you do you. Okay, Pickled Bites. Yum, I've never seen these before. I was actually surprised how\nmuch healthy stuff they had at this 7-Eleven, but it's\nliterally just pickles. I think they're deal flavored\npickles in a bag, like that's awesome. Alright, so these were some\nlike fruit snacks that did not have added sugar into them. They were just the fruit. So these crispy apple chips, the only ingredient is apples, right? I might not want an apple on the road but if I want a crunchy, you\nknow, processed-like snack then here you go. Maybe that will satisfy you, maybe not. These Orchard Blend, Sweet Persimmon, Tart Apple and Tangy Peach dried chews. The only ingredients are\npeaches, apples, and persimmons. You can't get any\ncleaner than that really. So, and then this is apples fruit squeeze. It's not called apple sauce because actually it's\nnot just apples pureed, this is apple juice concentrate. So that is gonna have\na little bit more sugar but it's not added. So another great gas\nstation food is popcorn. So this is just, you know,\nregular sea salt popcorn. The only ingredient, popcorn,\nsunflower oil and sea salt. I don't know if this\none is air fried or not but you could always look for air fried if you're looking for lower and fat this one's probably not because\nthere's nine grams of fat. And then these Popcorner chips, only ingredients are yellow,\ncorn, sunflower oil and salt. And the White Cheddar Smartfood. I love this stuff so much. It's actually not as bad\nfor you as you might think. And I talked about this in\nmy healthy processed foods video or low, you know,\nI did a video last year about processed foods that\nhave minimal ingredients. So if that's what you're looking for, when you're looking at,\nyou know, gas station foods watch that video because\nI go through a lot of surprising processed\nfoods that have just a couple of ingredients. And this one I compare\nspecifically to, they have like, what is it a Smartfood 100 where it's like a hundred calorie Smartfood\npop compared to this one. And that one has way more ingredients. And it's actually not that\nmuch lower in calories. It's like nominal when you weigh it out. And I actually show you this side by side. While talking, you know, super processed, these are other ones that\nI've mentioned in the healthy processed or low\ningredient processed foods video. Pork rinds, okay? Pork rinds are almost always just gonna be fried pork skins and salt, right? Or, you know oil if they're fried. I don't personally love\nthe taste of pork rinds, but a lot of people do and\nit's actually a cleaner food. Chips, now Baked Lays\ndo have more ingredients but they have less fat\nbecause they're baked. These Lays only have\npotatoes, oil and salt. That's three ingredients. It could be worse, right? So like you have to decide\nwhat's worth it to you. And again, why are you, why\nare you getting this snack? Are you really just like wanting a crunchy delicious thing on the\nroad then why are you gonna force yourself\nto get the apple chips, when are these really\ndoing that much damage? I don't know. I would argue no. I would argue personally now\nmy feeling is the stress. I used to get so stressed\nout about this stuff. The stress that I would\nput my body and mind under, choosing something I didn't want because I was trying to be healthy, actually physiologically that\nstress did my body more damage than just eating the chips. That's me personally, okay? And then pretzels, pretzels are always. I love pretzels so much, you\nknow, it's a could be worse it's could be worse kind of food. Like they don't have too many ingredients. Yeah, it's white flour. It's enriched, but it could be worse. Nuts and seeds are another\ngreat choice that you can find at almost any convenience store. And if you are trying to be\npaleo or Whole30 or whatever, this is probably where you\nshould head to be safe. Watch out though,\nespecially if you're doing a strict elimination\ndiet like the Whole30. You can't eat peanuts for\ninstance, there are legumes, but most nuts are, a lot of\nnuts are fried in or roasted in peanut oil, so you have to check. And sometimes it'll say\nlike canola or peanut oil and you don't know which so\nit's not technically compliance. That gets really tricky. But for the most part,\nyou know, nuts are nuts. What I will say about the\nnut situation is if you go in shell or raw, it's\ngonna be your cleanest bet. Same goes for sunflower\nseeds in the shell. You can't get any cleaner than that. When it starts to come to flavoring, okay? So like these peanuts are salt and lime. The ingredients list gets longer. There's sugar and corn syrup,\nsolids and dextrose, right? And maltodextrin, whatever. There's more stuff in it\nis it the end of the world? If there is some stuff in your\npeanuts and you like them, lime flavored, that's up to you. Like me, I hate raw almonds. I will never eat a raw almond. It just tastes disgusting to me. These Wasabi Bold Almonds, I love these. They're so freaking good. They're not clean. They're not clean at\nall, but they're tasty. And really, you know, it's, I mean, they're not clean but they've\ngot one gram of added sugar. To have sugar is the main\nthing you're looking out for. You can still have a\ndelicious, crunchy snack where you know you're getting some nutrition. Uuhm these Love Corn. I don't know this brand,\nI've never had it before but any kind of like roasted\ncorn snack like this, the only ingredients are\nusually corn and oil and salt. This one also has habanero chili. One other thing I wanted\nto bring attention to was trail mixes, because\nthis is something else you can find at a gas station. And usually this is what trail, I guess trail mixes are technically\nlike for the trail, right? Like you go on a hike, you go on a trail and you've got this like mix\nthat'll keep you satisfied. Well, you know, on a car trip\nis sort of the same thing. If you don't have access\nto a food for a while, then a trail mix should\nkeep you satisfied. Here's the thing, you\nprobably already know this if you're watching this\nchannel, most trail mixes especially if they have\ndried fruit in them they have a lot of added sugar. This is so sneaky. Look at these two packages, which one looks healthier to you? Right, yeah, I mean, you\ndecide for yourself, but yeah this one looks like the branding\nmakes it look healthier. Like look at all these\nhealth claims, protein no artificial colors or\nflavors, no preservatives low sodium, blah, blah, blah. But then you look at the\nadded sugar of each of these. So this one just looks like\na regular old thing of, you know, nut and fruit mix. This one has one gram of added sugar and this one has eight. It's from the cranberries. Usually cranberries are\ngonna have added sugar. This one only has one gram\nof added sugar though. So I would actually pick this one and the ingredients are\njust as clean, right? So you have to read the label and don't go based on\nthe sneaky marketing. That being said maybe you\nwant really sweet cranberries in your trail mix, you know. Eating at a gas station is not forever. At least if you're going\non a road trip, I mean you're not gonna die from\neating some added sugar on your cranberries,\nor even from, you know picking the honey bun or the powdered sugar\ndonuts that I like to eat at a gas station, right? Like maybe when you're on a road trip this is the one time you get\nto indulge in eating some of those, you know, nostalgic\ngas station favorites, that you don't let\nyourself have very often or that you don't have the\nopportunity to have very often. So for me, giving myself permission in those contexts to say, no this is when I really want to\nhave the powdered sugar donuts and enjoy them fully. That's what works for me. The next go-to at a gas station or convenience store would be\nlike protein or meat snacks. So Jerkys is what a lot of people go for for a healthy snack. To be honest, the 7-Eleven I was at had no clean Jerkys at all. There are clean Jerkys now. Like it used to be you couldn't find a jerky without added sugar. You can find it now,\nbut not at my 7-Eleven. So these, are both, you know,\none has seven grams of sugar. The second ingredient is sugar. The Turkey Jerky has\nonly four grams of sugar but the second ingredient or maybe it's third\ningredient is still sugar. The Turkey Jerky has a really long a much longer ingredients list. So by the kind of arbitrary\nrule I gave you at the beginning of the video where I said, I\ngo by ingredients, you know and I look at sugar, whatever, I'm kind of breaking that rule because I would actually\npick this one over this. Why would I pick it? I like the way it tastes. I actually prefer the taste and texture of Turkey jerky, right? So this is the point you guys, there are no rules and any rule,\nhard and fast rules you set around food are only\ngonna make you miserable. They only made me miserable. I should speak from my\nexperience, huh, okay. These rules made me miserable and letting go of the rules\nthat like, I can only eat it if there's this much sugar\nor not, and this can't exist on the label or it has to\nbe this many, whatever. All that stuff drove me nuts. At the end of the day,\nit's one snack, okay? It's one snack on one car\ntrip, pick the one you want. This beef steak thing,\nthis looks so disgusting. I've never eaten one of these, but I had to get it\nbecause it was an option. So it's pretty much just\nas bad as the jerky. I mean, not as bad, it\nhas two grams of sugar but has a bunch of, Oh, it has MSG in it. Ooh, it's probably good. This Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip. I've never seen this or tried it before but I was impressed. It doesn't have any added sugar. The ingredients are\npretty clean and you know, it's a good option for a\nlow, moderately low calorie. It's a hundred calories,\nhigh protein, clean snack. You can also buy tuna at the gas station. Who knew 7-Eleven sold\nlike regular chunk tuna. Now this is not, I would\nsay this is probably not ideal to like get in\nyour car and eat this. Unless you have a, a can\nopener in the middle console, then it's not gonna be\nfeasible or easy to eat. But this little Wild Tuna\nMeal Kit, 7-Select brand which I think that's\n7-Eleven brand, right? It's, you know, pretty clean. I mean, it's got crackers. So, you know, if there's\nenriched flour in there, but this could be a good way to\nget a satisfying protein snack. They also of course have a whole\nlike aisle of protein bars. I haven't eaten protein\nbars in a couple of years but I was like, oh my gosh, there are so many protein\nbars now, most of them, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't eat them because I don't like the way they taste. Protein bars don't fill me up. But I wanted to at least\npick one up for the sake of the video, because of\ncourse it's an option, right? And depending on your health\ngoals and your food freedom it might be the right choice for you. I grabbed this. I don't actually like the way these tastes but they had the best,\nthe best ingredients. You know, it's like six\ningredients and it's pretty clean. Personally, I would\nprobably eat the baby bell or the cheese stick which\nhe gives me, two of these would give me as much protein in this. And it tastes way better. The other thing about protein bars, I said that they don't fill me up. They don't fill me up\nphysically, but also mentally. So a lot of times I eat them and I still feel like\nI haven't eaten food. So if I'm really hungry I wanna\neat something where my mind and body both know, okay, I ate. And if I'm wanting to eat a processed food and I'm just like, oh,\nthe protein bar kind of like satisfies the process, you\nknow, food itch or whatever. It doesn't for me anymore. It used to, now I want the real deal. I want, you know, the donuts\nor the chips or whatever. So I couldn't go into a gas station without buying a candy bar, right? So I have a Twix bar here and\nI also have this healthier Hu, Hu, Hu Get Back To Human Chocolate. So it's dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate. It's also organic, 70%\ncacao, vegan, paleo. I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm not a chocolate person. I like Twix bars, I like snicker bars, but not because I like chocolates 'cause of all the other good stuff in it. So, this would bring me no joy. Would it bring you joy? Maybe if you're someone\nwho likes dark chocolate, I would rather have the Twix bar. So again, intention here matters. If your intention is\ntrying to satisfy a deep desire to have a Snickers bar, right? This is probably not gonna do it. And this is why a lot of times\nwe can eat these substitutes and then still feel hungry or unsatisfied mentally and physically. But if you're just like, no,\nI really like dark chocolate and I really want a square\nof it to just, you know, have a little sweet after\nmy lunch or whatever then maybe it satisfies you. The only way to know is to\ntune into your inner wisdom. No one outside can tell you. Okay and the last snack is\nnot one I would recommend for if you want to eat\nhealthy at a convenience store but I saw them and I\ncouldn't not buy them. So I figured I'd buy it and taste it. These are pop tart bites. I couldn't resist. So there's 40 grams of sugar\nand 41 grams of added sugar. Oh my gosh, look so cute. Smell your food before you\neat it it'll taste better. There's your mindfulness tip. Oh my God, hmm. It tastes exactly like\nyou think it would taste. It's perfect, oh my gosh, that's so good. It's like a miniature\nPop-Tart that's almost better because there's a better\nratio of like icing, icing to cookie or pastry\nor whatever mixture than on a regular side Pop-Tart. Oh, these are so good. Not recommended if you're\ntrying to eat healthy at a convenience store, but\nI went to a convenience. I went to 7-Eleven and I saw them and I could not get them, so. So, that is the spread. I literally walked into a 7-Eleven. I was like, how many\nhealthy items can I get? This is what I found. I hope that it, you know,\nsupports your journey in some way. The goal was not for me to tell you these are the snacks to\nget, it was to help you really start to investigate\nwithin yourself. What are my intentions here, right? Like why does this matter to me? Just my own experience. I spent so much time, so many\nyears causing myself stress and distress around food and health and trying to make the right choice and then choosing what\nI didn't actually want because I thought I\nwas doing my body right and I was actually causing\nnot just like mental stress, but physiological stress\nin my body, dysregulation. I couldn't lose weight no\nmatter how many calories I ate because of that stress. So this is my mission here is\nto help you not stress so much about food and health, because so much of what we thought mattered\nreally doesn't matter that much, if our stress isn't under control.

350 degrees first let's measure out the dry ingredients in a bowl with 2 cups of all-purpose flour add 2/3 of a cup of cocoa powder 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt mix these ingredients together and set the bowl aside now in a stand mixer or large bowl combine 1 cup of softened butter with one and a half cups of white sugar and cream these together next on a lower speed add two eggs one at a time and add two teaspoons of vanilla extract beat this until it's light and fluffy now stir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture and mix this until it's well blended scrape down the sides with a spatula to incorporate all of the ingredients next add two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and if desired half a cup of chopped walnuts drop the batter using an ice-cream scoop onto ungreased cookie sheets about two inches of heart we're making twenty four large cookies here and you can make 48 smaller ones by using rounded teaspoonfuls one Allrecipes member points out that chillin the batter for an hour before baking will keep the cookies from flattening out wrap them in plastic wrap now when you're ready to bake them remove the plastic wrap and place the cookie sheets in preheated oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes or just until set briefly cool the cookies on the cookie sheets then transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely",

we're gonna do is we don't get us a small bowl then our flour salt and baking soda then I'll just mix it you know mix it all up I would suggest using a whisk but no one's got a fork down [Music] now you want to get yourself a larger bowl and you want to add your granulated sugar brown sugar and then listen you want to put your two sticks of butter hey one thing I want to say about the butter is listen it needs to be room temperature it has to be softened not melted but song and then what you want to do is you want to mix them together until it becomes creamy [Music] now once you reach the texture that you know that creamy texture then you want to start adding your eggs so we're gonna have one at a time and this is we don't even mix a whale after each addition you just want to make sure that you thoroughly mixed into the other creamy goodness [Music] [Music] once we finish you know adding the two eggs to our mixture and we're done with that and it's mixed very well and then we want to start gradually introducing the flour mixture this is you want to introduce it you know you want to do it in increments so you just add a little bit here mix it up then once all the flour and all of that is mixed in then you want to add a little bit more you can repeat that process until all your flour is added to your mixture and you're done once you're done adding all your flour and then you got your mixture you know that start to resemble like you know like cookie dough then what you want to do is just add your chocolate chip morsel hands and then you know you just want to mix a lot get to each other I like to hold some back I say I don't know I can't really tell you how much I hold back let's just like it a small handful yeah so after I make my pie you know once I spread my cookie

already cold i've been talking so much my coffee turned cold good for me why am i drinking it so first things first we're gonna grab francesca because we can't we can't do this recipe without franny obviously and also i am making a triple batch obviously i'm making your trip i am committed to this recipe but i will put all the conversions below for you guys in case you want to do the single batch instead though i mean i mean you're gonna make cookies and do a triple badge for annie getting in here girl franny you're not very decorated we need to change that it's okay frannie i got just what you need girl [Music] yay and it's the one i have chocolate on so i mean specials from our baking days there you go that's better i don't even have your bowl oh there we go now we're ready so first we're gonna do all of the wet ingredients so we're gonna start with the butters and the sugars first so again remember i'm tripling the recipe here we are going to start by lifting you up don't lose your hat look at that look at that what a talent she is franny so we have here one and a half cups of butter get in there thank you for going straight in the bowl and then one and a half cups of white sugar and the same thing for brown sugar beautiful look at that it's gone so swimmingly so far so i'm gonna start by beating this first before we start adding in eggs and stuff because i like to get the butter and the sugar all like amalgamated you know this is just personal preference i don't think it really matters but uh this is how i do things i'm sometimes very particular when i bake and also sometimes not all right remix [Music] ooh i got a new hand soap i'm testing out for like a tick tock video just realized that how that sounds i'm just supposed to go some slow for a big bug video that's right everyone we're well rounded and clean so now that we have the butter and the sugar nicely combined it has this nice paste like consistency to it we're going to go in next with we have vanilla we have a little bit of eggs as well as the chocolate this is just one of the chocolates there are two only two though no wait three but that lose your hat franny keep it um stubbornly gonna make this work we're gonna start with three eggs three french ends two turtle doves and a partridge and a pear tree yes i'm a very talented singer my calling i just missed it and we're also going to add in a tablespoon of vanilla extract if you can get some good vanilla paste or vanilla extract you're looking for the pure stuff not the artificial stuff it makes a big difference in how your cookies end up tasting or any of your baked goods so highly recommend it it's a little bit of an investment buzz real good so one tablespoon in and we're gonna mix this together while we start melting down some chocolate so i have here 15 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate and this is just some like the bars and i just chopped it down because we're going to melt it and add it into the batter this is going to add that rich reverse chocolatey kind of vibe just touched butter and egg and i'm just melting it down in the microwave i'm not doing like the whole like double boiler thing although you could if you wanted to be fancy and what better time than christmas time to be extra fancy pop this in the microwave because not fancy melting some chocolate mixing up some eggos not eggos but i call my eggs egg sometimes that can be confusing on camera i guess all right mixer up for annie wait for chocolate we're gonna have coffee this is peppermint mocha coffee not just plain old because you know christmas are you guys a big fan of eggnog speaking of beverages i don't know how i feel about it i feel like eggnog is one of those things that i want one small cup full and that's it mmm this is looking so good so now we're going to pour this in we don't want it to be too piping hot like you should be able to touch the outside of the bowl because you don't want to cook the eggs that are in here and just overheat the batter and melt all the butter but obviously it should be all melted that's kind of important now we have our batter look at that it looks so decadent i'm very excited so now we're going to go on to the dry ingredients this right here is five cups of all-purpose flour we also have some baking soda and baking powder one and a half teaspoons of each as well as one and a half teaspoons of salt we have here kosher salt i should also mention for the butter make sure you have unsalted butter always unsalted butter when you're baking you want to be able to control how much salt is going into your typically sweet desserts i have the flour the baking soda the baking powder and the salt combining it all into a bigger bowl because this bowl was too small and then to this before we add it into the wet ingredients we are going to add in some cocoa powder and this just to me just enhances the already chocolaty mixture but it doesn't add an extra layer of sweetness which makes it too much but that deep rich chocolate flavor is there which i really love about this so three tablespoons in and we're just gonna stir it to combine it all together now let's start adding it into the batter christopher christopher are making the cookies the reverse ones the chocolate ones yeah is this okay wait wait i know these are very christmassy but your mom does do the the caramel peppermint ones which ones are your favorites at christmas the rolo peppermint ones but any other time those ones yeah it's these ones for me year round what's your favorite christmas dessert then probably still brownies brownies eh yeah yeah with like like pepper with the candy canes on top or just like straight up brownies just straight up fudgy chocolate brownies so good you know what i just learned to start appreciating is gingerbread gingerbread cookies but they have to be like the nice doughy ones not the rock hard ones i don't like those but a good gingerbread cookie it's so good i'm sad i missed out on those so many years i just thought they all had to be rock solid and tasteless okay show again don't be shy tell me how many of you are baking this right now with me tell me in the comments let me know unless your hands are covered with flour like mine then don't ruin your computer or your phone am i even it's all over my counter that's okay it's christmas like a towel for this part it's starting to get everywhere covering it with a towel though is a very good hack though prevents a lot of flour loss last little [Music] bead okay now this is all combined and you can see it's like really starting to come to the top so much cookie dough now we're gonna add in a three-quarter cup of sour cream now i have added it in at this stage which is what my mother-in-law does but i've also added it in with the wet ingredients and i find both ways it works well just so you know bloop get in there sour cream you know sometimes when the recipe is this good you just don't question the method now at this point i'm going to mix it but i'm going to mix it on low and just enough so it is combined i do not want to over mix it at this point because it has all the flour in it and we're also going to be oh i'm so sorry i'm embarrassing sorry about that franny we're also going to be adding in the chocolate chips and folding those in as well so again very important don't overwork your cookie dough all right now at this point we're going to be folding in all the white chocolate chips tonight yeah there's a lot of cookie ingredients on there that's okay we're going to remove the paddle at this point i don't want to waste any i want to keep as much on here as possible while i get all this off i want to talk about like christmas traditions like what i'm really excited about so number one very excited to put together all of the the kids stockings i find that to be so fun because i never grew up with uh with stockings as a kid but kristin and always the clementines in the in the toe of the stocking always so i love that plus all the kids have matching pajamas this year which i mean i know it's silly but i love that and if you watch my other video on my christmas traditions my my oma would always make and oma by the way um a lot of you guys were asking so my mom's side my oh my oppa are german so that's where that came from but anyway my omo would always make us um robes for christmas and sometimes ones for like our dolls or our barbies and then my grandma would always make us like these little christmas dresses my mom would like curl our hair and put lipstick on us and we would like sit there for like christmas pictures you know like our fancy outfits i always felt like a superstar but every year my sister and i always make a photo book for my parents and for my oppa it's just a nice way of like consolidating the air even in 2020 there were good moments oh my gosh this is this is so this is so heavy this is my workout it's my workout for 20 20 right here just mixing cookie dough this is not enough chocolate chips it's very much not enough hey christopher hey you want to do something really fun it's so fun but i really want it i know but you have to come over here though okay so here's the fun thing so see this if you mix it that's all i got it's really fun though you should try it it's like a game i feel like you weren't being truthful you said really fun this is extremely funny yeah it doesn't feel like enough but i feel like it's heavy right oh you know what it i just realized now i was going to make nanaimo bar what's she going to make okay christopher i've never had an animal bar from your mom nope okay christopher as a kid and teen and most of my adults i thought they were called nanamo bars oh by the way for those of you that don't know nanamo bars nope take two so for those of you that don't know okay okay take three so nanaimo bars they're a layer of chocolate and coconut on the bottom and then it's like a custardy icing and then you can either put like sprinkles on top or just leave it as is i've seen some people put like a brick of chocolate on top which is wrong but it's okay and my mom makes it every year at christmas time and they're like my favorite thing i'm excited for that that is good how's the looking is that enough chocolate chips i feel like that's good i feel like that's good okay now we're gonna put this in the fridge because you have to let your cookie dough rest it needs to chill in the fridge for a while it's worth it we're gonna do that and then we'll be back all right cookie dough has been chilling in the fridge for a while and now we have put it out on a nice little baking sheet so it's going to go into the oven 350 for around 12 minutes or so every oven is so different i hesitate to give times check it at 10 minutes and then go from there all right cookies be delicious goodbye okay christopher christopher cookies cookies okay they look so good look at them these are a great cookie like they just are superior in so many different ways and just something a unique spin but not for the sake of just uniqueness this is a solid cookie no there's logic and reason to these emphasis and i don't even really like white chocolate but it works here it does in fairness i've never tried it with chocolate chips i should try that sometime no it needs to be white chocolate i guess we have to taste those oh no you want that one and i will take this one okay no i don't want that one i want this one it's just it's a really pretty one saving it over here for tonight i'm watching my netflix you're saving it for the thumbnail aren't you no it's really pretty okay gotta say no no something i recognize it from the thumbnail you already clicked on that cookie well i mean wouldn't you though no it's perfect it's such a perfect cookie cheers i don't deserve that cookie okay i'll have it no don't do it it's a beautiful cookie and like it is moist all the way through just the right amount of flour for me personally that it it creates this like soft cookie but it's not like oozing out everywhere right butter to flour ratio and yes crispy edge but like only just the slightest bit crispy right on the outside the right amount and you're right the white chocolate it adds a little something it's different yeah yeah i wouldn't know this sour creams in it and i don't even really know what the sour cream is doing in here but it works it does like it doesn't not work i don't question your mom and her baking she knows she just knows this is such a good cookie you need to make these immediately and tag me on instagram so i can see you also enjoying these cookies it wouldn't if you told me hey i'm gonna melt chocolate and pour it into cookie batter i'd be

christmas why are you wearing a t-shirt it's cold outside oh i heard why aren't you there's a are you talking to them how do you know who are you i don't care what you're wearing is chilly okay okay

making these cookies and tag me because i want to see you guys doing all the baking and i hope you guys enjoyed this i hope you guys have a wonderful wonderful weekend thank you so much for hanging out with us and baking and i'll see you guys all in my next video love you all", "DklohxcbynY": "[Music] hi I'm chef Rafi and welcome to a new episode of baking with chef profile a show that's all about making you a better home baker today I'm going to show you chocolate cookies now the chocolate cookies I have they actually it's 2 in 1 they have cocoa powder and they have white chocolate for the ingredients we need margarine 1 egg vanilla essence cocoa powder sugar the white chocolate this all-purpose flour and baking powder will serve the baking powder and which is a half a teaspoon so that's half a teaspoon add cocoa powder and now for the margarine around 110 110 grams now for up to the margarine I'll add the sugar so first of all mix using a hand spatula like that and then using an electric mixer a hand mixer so it takes about two to two three minutes when you're using the electric mixer but the idea again is to have it light and fluffy and I rated and this will add my one egg and the vanilla essence now at this point we'll add our flour baking powder and cocoa mixture so what I'll do is sift everything together so you can actually just pick them as they are without adding the chocolate chips but you're making them more chocolaty by just adding the chocolate chips and it also gives a nice contrast between the brown chocolate and the white chocolate for the white chocolate we have the original recipe says one and a half cups which is about 260 grams of white chocolate but to be honest you can always adjust it depending on how much you have or how much you like up there you like the white chocolate so as you can see there are smaller pieces now add them to my cookie butter and mix so like I said you can use your judgment to determine how much white chocolate to add and you can also use the brown chocolate chips if you have them if you don't have the white ones so I have a baking tin here what I'm doing now is using an ice cream scoop because this helps in scooping out the cookie dough into that train and then space them using the back of a spoon or the ice cream scoop press gently now by pressing this way slightly what you're doing is that you're helping the cookie flatten because as it cooks now that's where you give that space it flattens so you need to give it space to spread but I hope you've learned something today those are my chocolate cookies recipe I've been your host chef Raffaele subscribe to the channel so that you've notified every time I have a new recipe follow me on Instagram Facebook and Twitter for more recipes and tips and until next time [Music]", "D0d5QqOzb3k": "[Music] plenty of chocolate chips in there and you're going to be left with the closest thing to a chocolate chip cookie with this much protein in it that you will ever see [Music] welcome back to the anabolic hub where we make anabolic deliciousness we're back inside my kitchen today doing another take on an original recipe today we're going to be doing chocolate chip protein cookies i've done a few iterations of this one i think i've come up with the best set of ingredients to make it at least an 8 out of 10 or better so let's get things rolling right away by having a look at the ingredients here we go vanilla based casein protein powder all-purpose flour salt baking powder non-fat plain greek yogurt ricotta cheese part skim vanilla extract i can't believe it's not butter the light one swerve brown sugar sugar-free syrup and of course no sugar added baking chocolate chips so here we have another one of those magical recipes we're mixing together some dry ingredients then we're mixing together some wet ingredients we're combining the two some anabolic deliciousness so let's get things started here by mixing together the dry ingredients first and right out of the gate we need 99 grams of our vanilla based casein protein powder that's a lot 99 grams of our casein protein powder is in then we need 60 grams of our all-purpose flour we initially went a little over but there's 60 grams on the money then you need a quarter teaspoon of your baking powder one leveled off scoop quarter teaspoon of the baking powder going in and the requirement in most baking recipes we're going to be putting in a quarter teaspoon of our salt leveled off a quarter teaspoon of the salt in man oh man the best part about baking recipes is that we get to sift or sieve our dry ingredients together yup no sifter yet still using a fork mostly because i know you guys have forks but i've said it before sifter coming soon all right let's get to sifting don't sleep on it just do it get it done sifting finished now we're going to be moving on to the wet ingredients the first one we're going to be putting in is 56 grams of i can't believe it's not butter the light one we're going to be using our negative scale trick and i know i didn't invent the negative scale trick but thank you for pointing it out in the comments section 56 grams going in exactly 56 grams in next up we need 40 grams of our sugar-free maple syrup 40 grams is it and just like we'll do after each of our wet ingredients we're going to mix these together as we go it's just much easier to incorporate them all that way so we're going to get started by mixing together i can't believe it's not butter with our maple syrup quick substitution gonna use our spatula i know the metal on metal ain't great right all right let's mix it it still clangs with the spatula too so i don't know you do also kind of break up that i can't believe it's not butter as you go so that's a good thing too it's going to help it incorporate better with all the ingredients our next kind of wet ingredient is our swerve brown sugar i call it a wet ingredient because there is some moisture to it and it really just mixes better with the wet ingredients than it does with the dry so we're going to be putting in here 20 grams of our swerve brown sugar [Music] minor correction but we have 20 grams of the brown sugar in hey so i'm a little lost can you guys smash the like button and comment down below so the algorithm can find me thanks in the always challenging to pour accurately vanilla extract we're gonna be doing five grams of this whoo it is worth noting five grams on the money and we're gonna mix that in i know i didn't mix the brown sugar i should have done that but the vanilla extract not much of a difference to mix it here okay we got that all incorporated there next up we have a couple options so we're going to be using a greek yogurt and ricotta cheese combination if you have to use all greek yogurt you can you just don't get the same cookie type texture when you do that at least not the way i found so what i'm going to be doing is initially adding in 200 grams of our non-fat plain greek yogurt okay we got it and because i'd use this spoon to scoop out the greek yogurt and we want to be a hundred percent accurate i am going to mix in the rest of this greek yogurt that is on the spoon using this spoon greek yogurt incorporated and our last wet ingredient is going to be 60 grams of the ricotta cheese if you don't have ricotta cheese or if you just want to use the non-fat greek yogurt that's fine just do 260 grams instead of the 200 that we just put in i find that these cookies come out much better if you're adding a little bit of ricotta so we're going to be doing that here 60 grams exactly on the spoon here we're going to mix it up and once you have all of your wet ingredients well incorporated should be all one uniform color and we're ready to add in our dry ingredients in three separate batches in goes batch number one batch number two and batch number three and once everything's incorporated well here you should have what seems like it might be a little bit of a dryish dough but much like will tennyson's apple fritter dough it looks dry but it's not if you put your hands in and actually feel it the dough is actually quite moist so we are all set here now we need to fold in the chocolate chips we're going to measure out 30 grams of our no sugar added baking chocolate chips 30 grams and they go in and once you have your chocolate chips in there what you want to do is fold them into your dough [Music] all right you may have a few straggler chips but that's okay you're gonna put those into the cookies when we start forming them which is what we're going to do in our next step next we're going to use our high capacity non-stick spray and spray it down fire away coat it and any of you who have seen my previous cookie baking recipes you know that the number eight is my favorite so i'm going to be making eight of these cookies show you how to do that we're going to be forming them with our hands it's just easier to put them together that way so let's get that started oh chocolate chip remnants of my hand here and i know i need some moisturizer all right let's do it do is you just take a little bit of the dough in the palm of your hand and then you're going to press it down you want them to be pretty thin about as thick as a chocolate chip in terms of measuring height wise so you want to be pretty flat these will rise up initially and then once we let them cool they will come back down to your more traditional cookie type thickness all right so once you put one together you have something that looks like that and we just lay it on our cookie sheet we have all of our ingredients together they're on the money cookies are on the sheet we are ready to put these into the oven we have it preheated right now at 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius we're going to bake them for about 10 to 15 minutes checking them along the way we're going to take them out let them cool for 10 to 15 minutes then it's over to the taste test table alright let's put them in [Music] okay so i took the cookies out of the oven and let them cool directly on the cookie sheet for 15 minutes took them off and it looks like we got some chocolate chip cookies that we have to take over to the taste test table let's do it alright so we are back at the taste test table here and i have a plate full of chocolate chip cookies in front of me these smell delicious oh my goodness i've made them before a couple times this is by far the best recipe i was able to come up with and i think you're all gonna love them too but let's give it the old taste test first here i'm gonna take the cookie that's on top and i'll show you guys a close-up see we have there all those chocolate chips looks so good right i really do think that that ricotta cheese helps out a lot if you can add that in i would highly recommend that you do it i do still think it will work i just don't think you get the same texture and flavoring that you do when you use it with no further ado let's jump into our taste test as we know the first bite is the best bite and it's going to be very hard not to eat this entire plate of cookies but let's try it here we go first bite oh yeah this is what a chocolate chip cookie is supposed to taste like it's not cakey it's not overly moist in the middle it's not egg whitey because we didn't put any egg whites in it the more flour that you add in you will get more of that traditional cookie type texture the only problem is that it ends up throwing off the macros and the ratios with the protein powder it doesn't quite work right the way i made it is the best combination of all-purpose flour and protein powder that seem to have the best cookie-like texture curious what you guys might think if you do try them i'd be wondering what your thoughts are on that as well in terms of texture how do they taste does it seem like you're biting into a real cookie i feel like this is as close as you can get having a protein chocolate chip cookie tastes like an actual chocolate chip cookie plenty of chocolate chips in there it's not overly chewy nor is it cakey now you do have to let them rest for a little while having them cool for 15 minutes is a challenge when you first take them out of the oven they've kind of risen up a little bit and you're like ugh these are gonna taste super spongy they're gonna be like very cakey like substance that's why it's so important to let them cool for an extended amount of time i think 15 minutes maybe a little bit longer but 15 minutes seems to be a good sweet spot where they come down to this traditional cookie type depth depth width height this is a winner i think this is as close as you can get to having a real cookie that has this much protein in it for sure no chewiness no sponginess i made this same batch the night before and then the next day they were even better so really it's like these are almost like a fine wine the longer you let them rest and sit the better they actually come out i know that can be disappointing to folks who like to have cookies right out of the oven let them cool for about five minutes and then have them nice and gooey this isn't a gooey type of cookie this is more of your traditionally baked cookie more of like a soft cookie not really a chewy cookie not really a hard cookie that's going to crumble it's just the right amount of chocolate chips again i would hold out maybe about 5-10 grams of the chocolate chips and spread them on top i think that that actually works really well it kind of happens by default when you're folding them in not all the chocolate chips get completely incorporated so you should have enough but either way if you want to be safe i would hold out some chocolate chips then you're insured to have a chocolate chip in every single bite that you take and they just look prettier man i will put these up against anybody's protein chocolate chip cookies out there taste test challenge these are that good you guys gotta try them i can't emphasize it enough the key is in the rest time don't rush these if you eat them too soon they're gonna be chewy they're gonna be cakey if you let them cool completely all that moisture is gonna come out and you're gonna be left with the closest thing to a chocolate chip cookie with this much protein in it that you will ever see i'm gonna flash up the macros here so you guys can see exactly what's in these incredible macros can't believe the amount of protein you get in a cookie that tastes like this it's awesome you could easily meal prep these for the entire week you could have two of these for a snack easy nice grab-and-go on hand not gonna have any of the junk food that might be tempting during the week well that's a whole cookie down i'm thinking of things to say just so i can say here and eat another cookie i'm just kidding if you do try these please let me know in the comment section down below i love to talk about it i know the biggest thing with cookies that comes out is that they're always either too chewy too cakey or spongy i think these are none of that and i really want to know what your opinion is on them so if you make them please let me know in the comment section below what you think i'd love to know if you found anything better than this i certainly haven't i think the key again is in adding just the right amount of all-purpose flour to give that more traditional cookie texture so if you guys try these let me know in the comment section down below we'll have another boisterous discussion about it but i gotta get up out of here i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "4Se0yNvH7WA": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel y'all today

see how that look and that shows the butter sugar egg and almond extract i'm trying with this round just a little bit more just a little bit more and i'll be back all right guys so i'm just going to save my flour directly um over this first i'm going to start with one one cup of flour and then i add just a little bit of baking powder and baking soda in there as well while i save it because i and i that's one cup right here and a dab of salt just for that because i didn't want any dirty of anything else that's the lazy bad way okay this is the lazy man's way all right let me see that's a pinch because i'm gonna add some more in the other batch all right let me see is that just a little bit maybe it's a little more just a little more whoa whoa after you can do the um other way where you completely save the flowering um baking powder and baking soda together that'd be perfectly fine and just a little bit of this as well so i added just a little bit a pinch of salt baking powder and baking soda i'm gonna save this through 77 know growing up in jamaica you know you're civil yeah monday my river sits down the sun and bag it up on yourself you know what i say make your money alright

more couple put this back over they saw i'm just pouring the flour over my sink there's one more cup just a ten more pinch of salt so make sure the pinch smaller than the pinch before it'll smell small like a peach small little pinches all right see all that tiny if you could see it just a little more oh i'm not confusing y'all okay you know i and i don't take no man don't do measurements trying to be precise well as precise as i could get ain't gonna be perfect ain't gonna be perfect baby bird all right we'll mix this around [Music] oh yeah this is so cheap and easy to make like very inexpensive perhaps the most expensive thing here is um the white chocolate the white chocolate let us know that's pretty cheap see i'm all about like i can definitely buy these just buy the sugar cookie already made at the store that saves a lot of time they know some days you want your you want to make it your own just have fun in the kitchen this will be one of them days that i'm going with half cup now so for the half cup i'm just going to pour this in i ain't gonna put nothing else with it whoa see working with flour is so messy it can be very messy so you gotta take your time and slowly fold it over so it doesn't fly everywhere oh yeah it's starting to come together oh my arm all right since i added that little extra that extra half of butter i'm gonna go all the way to some more flour i almost mix this around and when i come back and put the almond i mean the white chocolate in there all right guys so everything's all mixed together y'all i took some out so i could save

thought when you think of getting a cookie but this classic baked snack is a staple on nearly every fast-food menu McDonald's chick-fil-a Starbucks Panera Bread and Subway all have cookie offerings Subway's pretty well known for its cookies people are always raving about them those chewy cookies make it hard to stop at just one they are also the cheapest of the other fast-food outlets offering cookies Subway's workout at just 76 cents even though Subway's cook is very popular I believe there is one major flaw that they could fix today if they wanted to the cookies all end up tasting like their Italian sandwich bread and salad selection especially the red onions but only on the top side of the cookie so why is this let's take everyone's refrigerator at home as an example food in the refrigerator should always be covered why food can cross contaminate or have condensation dripping on them air and moisture also allows bacteria to grow in Subway's case their cookies absorb other dominant subway odors from within the store especially the topside which is exposed all day they could fix this issue today by simply covering them up or having them in a fixed container clear display it's unsure whether their newly designed stores will do this but by the looks of it they haven't none of the other chains have this cookie odor problem some way could be right back in the battle of the cookie if they just fix their Bo problem [Music] body over bread odor I won Krispy Kreme that's why someone who's been coming off that win this week I'm on my way to Subway and we are making cookies however when I'm making one we're not making two we are making the really delicious flavors so to win this challenge me horny folk have to get two out of three four there's no tiebreaker my cookies just for you guys [Applause] [Music] I present to you subway cookie number one chocolate chip subway cookie number two macadamia nut my personal favorite one subway cookie number three imagens favorite cookie double chocolate-chip so here's how you make subway cookies at home into an electric mixer add 400 grams or 1 pound of unsalted butter and beat the butter until creamy add 1 and 2/3 of a cup of brown sugar and beat again scrape down the bowl and then add one cup of caster or superfine sugar and then beat until fluffy now add the eggs one at a time beating after each addition now add 1 tablespoon of vanilla and beat again and scrape into a separate bowl at 4 and 1/4 cups of plain flour 2 teaspoons of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of salt mix well until combined for the double chocolate-chip cookie put aside one cup of the wet mixture along with one and a half cups of the flour into the flour mix add half a cup of cocoa powder and mix well combine the dry and wet mix into a mixing bowl and add half a cup of white and chocolate chips combined then leave that cookie dough aside for the other two flavors again combine the wet and dry mix until it forms a thick cookie dough for the chocolate chip dough add half a cup of chocolate chips to the mixture and combine for the white chocolate and macadamia nut add in 1/4 of cup of white chocolate chips along with half a cup of roughly chopped macadamia nuts line a baking tray with baking paper and using an ice cream scoop place down your cookies roll them in your hand also pre-heat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit and bake for 10 to 12 minutes when you bring them out they'll still look uncooked and puffy but will collapse when they cool down now you can serve and get stuck into those bad boys Oh your

nicer cookie to me that's what a cookie took short acts like we have no last one here mm-hmm yep right first of all yeah I don't know you good boy pure disability can not one well what was the metal

flavour in there that shouldn't be there Oh mm-hmm so job mm-hmm if you had to choose live all right hands down this one yeah this side around this side all hands down better than each other it's like a block of the right place what they want that flavor is parable that's the first time someone spit at some food at the table and you're a bastard because you've got a question you know I'm like you

what can I say hey credible critters Jew they were almost identical you you you would just missing the aftertaste all I needed to do was just rub a bit of onion and some Italian herb bread over the topic what did you think Oh daddy's back and who told you to say that no thank you [Music] [Music]", "RRxW8L3Chz8": "okay we have to be serious for a second the entire winter season is cookie season even beyond the holidays any occasion to bake cookies is a good occasion anytime the weather's cold i'm happy to turn on the oven and make a batch of cookies and you may know my chocolate chip cookies well but this is my new favorite my salted caramel chocolate chip cookies so you take a good chocolate chip cookie and you just give it more more crunch on the outside more chewiness in the center more flavor more more more more that makes you want more cookies and it all starts with brown butter so instead of just creaming butter and brown sugar together i'm adding three quarters of a cup of unsalted butter to my pot and i'm going to melt it on high heat and actually let it brown this takes about three to four minutes you want the butter to melt it'll bubble up let the bubbling subside and watch the little bits at the bottom turn brown i can see some brown bits but most of all i smell the toastiness of this butter oh it's so good now i'll put my sugar into my bowls before i pour in the hot butter one cup of light brown sugar again building on that caramel flavor and i have a quarter cup of granulated sugar now i'll whisk in the browned butter right on top of the sugar even get in those little brown bits now the next ingredient is a real game changer for this cookie recipe two tablespoons of caramel sauce liquefied caramel guarantees the chewiest center to your chocolate chip cookies and i'll add a teaspoon of vanilla and now the sugar has absorbed the heat from the butter so i can crack in my single egg i'm very particular when it comes to baking a cake i always sift my flour but if i'm whipping up a batch of cookies you can just stir it all together in the bowl i have one and a half cups of all-purpose flour and here's another new addition to my recipe a quarter cup of rolled oats regular rolled oats it really helps give these cookies a good chew in the center it's worth it believe me why am i waving my spatula at you of course my signature addition to chocolate chip cookies a tablespoon of cornstarch and i have half a teaspoon of baking soda but i also want to add about half a teaspoon of flaked sea salt to the batter so i just crush it between my fingers and i give this all a stir there we go and of course we need chocolate chips you want one and a half cups total and i've got a mix one cup of regular chocolate chips and half a cup of salted caramel chips of course if they're not available just use all dark chocolate all right now it's time to scoop the cookies i've preheated my oven to 375 and these only take eight to ten minutes in the oven you wanna see a nice golden brown around the outside edge it's amazing how after just eight minutes the whole house smells like chocolate chip cookies now the last little tip to really set the chewy center to these cookies is give each tray a smack as you set it down not a big smack just a little one and immediately you see them drop now that's compressed the center and you know it's going to be so chewy but i've got the nice light brown edges with the two flavors of chocolate chip you can see the sea salt on it the only difficult step in this recipe is waiting for the cookies to cool long enough so you can pick one up and eat it smells so good these are honestly my new favorite cookie and i love that with the salted caramel it elevates the cookie perfect for a holiday tin but if it's just a blustery winter night and you want to turn on the oven and make a batch well you've got the perfect occasion just make sure you have a glass of cold milk nearby [Music] just that crispy ring on the outside chewy right in the center yeah it's chocolate chip cookie 2.0 you", "liE4Ys5CZig": "heyo so today I'm going to be making a mint chocolate chip cookie oh my goodness now I'm also

brown sugar chocolate chip cookies these gorgeous thin beautiful cookies are a long-running family favorite and this year I think they'll be perfect as a dessert for a Christmas gathering so these are very easy to make one pound of butter 3 cups of light brown sugar and 1 cup of regular sugar and cream the butter and sugar together and then you add 4 large eggs into the creamed butter and sugar these are farm-fresh eggs add the eggs one at a time right out of my hand house right out of my hands that beautiful chocolate brown egg and this really does loosen up the batter nicely I want the eggs to be totally incorporated into the butter and sugar and then two teaspoons of the best vanilla let that mix up while you sift three and a half cups of all-purpose flour with one and a half teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of baking soda that's another reason why the cookies are so nice and flat there's no leavening agent in the cookies and sifting is very easy when you use a wire whisk like this mixing up all the dry ingredients and then you can just add the flour while the machine is going at low speed and when you get down to the bottom you can sort of like ease the rest in and the last thing of course that goes into your chocolate chip cookie batter one and a half cups of best quality chocolate chips or chocolate bits like that like that all right have your oven preheated to 375 degrees and this amount makes about thirty delicious 4-inch cookies and another little hint that we love to share with all of you is using a release ice cream scoop for the batter you can just use a 2 ounce scoop this will give you a four inch cookie and the bake in about eleven minutes bake right on a Silpat and because he spread and because these are so large I suggest baking three on a sheet now these go right into a 375-degree oven if you're baking more than one sheet at a time in your oven make sure that about after five minutes you rotate the cookie sheet that will ensure a nice evenly baked cookie as I showed you before this is what they look like and this is mine I'm going to take it away it's a good thing all next this is chocolate chip cookies make them part of your holiday celebration [Music] you you", "2zIxR8DGQZ0": "I said I won't be sharing how to make delicious cheesecake cookies for the ingredients we need three egg yolks one and a half teaspoon of baking powder 1/4 teaspoon of salt this is 1/3 cup of Omaha layer I use OB powder in here or dehydrated over that I cook to get this if you want to learn how to make that watch my OB dream cake this is 3/4 cup of butter 115 grams or 4 ounces of cream cheese 1 cup + 1 tablespoon of sugar and 2 and a half cups of plain flour optional gel food coloring this is optional as well 3/4 cup of white chocolate chips optional cashews 3/4 cup as well before I forget it is important to have one and a half teaspoon of OBX track to begin combine the plain flour the baking powder and the salt give it a mix and set this aside we will sift this later chop the I'm cashew nuts into small chunks just like this now in a bowl combine the room-temperature butter and room-temperature cream cheese it is really important that these two ingredients is at room temperature so they will combine easily using a stand mixer beat the butter and cream cheese until it is well combined at this point we can add the OB challah yeah the OB challah yeah you can buy store-bought ones or you can use OB powder that you rehydrate I'll put a link in the description box how to do that now add the sugar it is now time to add 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of over extract make sure to get all the uber extra from the TSP give it a mix at this point I know that my batter will be very light so I'm adding gel food coloring you can only see three drops here but later I will add some more so all in all I use six drops of gel food coloring but it's totally up to you if you want to add some add the egg yolks one at a time beating in each addition so here you can see I added three more drops because I want my cookies to be bright purple and finally we can sift in the dry ingredients use the spatula first to mix [Music] once you feel that it's almost combined use the handheld mixer to quickly mix this to fully combine the dough don't do not over mix though at this point we can add the cashews and white chocolate chips fold this and once everything is well combined we're going to cover these with cling wrap and we're going to let it rest in the fridge for at least one hour so my dress in the fridge for about two eyes so before you start rolling make sure that your oven is preheated already at 180 degrees Celsius I measured my dough about one tablespoon each so just get one tablespoon of the dough and then roll this into a ball this dough will not spread very much so you can put them slightly close together so now we're ready to bake these in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes if you make it slightly bigger than this go for 12 minutes and this is what it looks like after baking let it cool down on the tray for at least five minutes before moving it into the wire rack to cool completely [Music] and this is the finished product this is so good I can guarantee that you're going to love this if you have OB halia lying around the house you can do this it's really delicious so I hope you give this a try I can guarantee that you're not going to regret making this and just to show you what it looks like inside when you cut or break the cookies in half you can see it's really moist inside thank you so much for watching and I'll see you again next week bye", "mNbcYMsp5uk": "[Music] hi guys open back to my channel today I'm gonna show you how to make white chocolates macadamia nuts cookies so let's get started first pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees then in a small bowl add in the flour baking soda and salt and whisk them together until they're combined and set it aside for now then in the bowl of a stand mixer or you can use an electric hand mixer add in this softens butter sugar ann's brown sugar and beat them on high speeds for two minutes then turn down the speeds and add in the egg and vanilla extract and beat it on high speeds for another two minutes and turn the speeds down to low and add in the dry ingredients and mix them in until they're just combined then add in the chopped up whites chocolate or you can use chocolate chips and the chopped and macadamia nuts and mix them in until they're combined then scoop the dough outs onto an ungreased baking sheet space and then bounce at least an inch then bake them in the oven for about eight to ten minutes or until they're just barely starting to turn brown around the edges and once they're done remove them from the oven and I like to Bing the baking sheets on the counter top to crack the tops of the cookies and let them cool in the pan for at least 2 minutes then transfer them to a cooling rack and

are many problems in this world that can't be improved with a cookie so my friend Kathleen King from Tate's Bake Shop the most renowned bakery in the Hamptons said she'd come by and make double chocolate almond cookies with me I mean who would say no to that hi Kathleen it's so great to see you okay what's first let's start with the flour and get that set aside okay first we need 2 and 1/3 cups flour now we'll do a teaspoon of baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon of salt yeah things like me we measure exactly okay what do you need you need poke a puppy what a cup cocoa I can do that okay right into them yep your ball okay fabulous thank you my whisk okay oh yeah I oh I actually always sit Dupree Kathleen whisks it well if the cocoa powder is lumpy I do sift it but because I'm generally somewhat lazy and so I do things quick you can't make cookies with that butter so how much do we need oh well today we need two and a quarter cup so it works and it's at room temperature has to be room temperature it's a really important detail yeah the money owed next I add the cup of sugar I was interesting I always thought you have to whip it well yeah I'm learning stuff now that's a very interesting detail this is the brown sugar which you always pack ina do this batch decide inspect the stem always have a spatula okay doctor nurse wonderful thank you okay we scrape this down so you don't have to over mix that's interesting so that's done now we're gonna add the egg and the vanilla pefki egg for you beautiful doctor in and vanilla yeah that's cool it's the most common flavor but it's the most delicious one it's good it's true it's one you shouldn't ever substitute on okay so we're gonna mix that in just a little bit so it's combined and that's it again I don't like to keep it going and because more isn't always better yeah great okay what's next okay we're gonna add the dry ingredients this is so interesting to get it from a master baker I do it slowly with the mixer on a little bit this time she dumps the whole thing yet I'll show you what to do now i pulse thee obviously you mix it just enough i pulse it so that it doesn't go cold that's a good idea so you're not wearing it like right oh that looks like good cookies now these are the chopped almonds and diamonds where you can do to your taste you can chop them small you can chop them like we need a cup and a half of the semi-sweet chocolate okay so that's one cup now another what this recipe is if you don't like white chocolate we can use it I'm sorry Chuck with people but I love white chocolate and one cup of white chocolate these are the kind of greetings that you can play with and shift around and that's it great which I'm scoping out yeah okay let's clear the decks so I actually always use these ice cream scoops for cookies this one's 1 and 3/4 inch is it about right yeah that's great two tablespoons okay so what are these Baker what don't they bake at 375 for about 15 minutes and then so 15 minutes I never just say okay here's the oven temperature 15 minutes in come and come back mm-hmm I'll put it maybe at 10 or 12 so I can see how things are going and then I can either catch something before it's happened yeah that's a really that's really smart okay into the oven yay I think we need some coffee for this time sure yeah let's make coffee while they're baking you can be miserable for you to cookie and you can be miserable after you eat a cookie but never while you're eating okay oh my god is amazing okay they're chewy they're chocolatey they're crunchy they fill all devices", "lSHeprzun3w": "welcome to start cooking calm I'm Cathy Meister today we're making chocolate chip cookies an ingredient and equipment list is at the end of this video start by measuring the flour baking soda and salt into a medium bowl you'll need one in 1/8 cups of flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of salt gently whisk these ingredients together and set this bowl aside for just a moment crack one egg into a small bowl and check that there are no shells at 1 teaspoon of vanilla and with a fork give it a quick mix we'll get back to this in just a few seconds now cut 4 ounces of room-temperature unsalted butter into chunks and put it into a large bowl add 6 tablespoons of light brown sugar and 6 tablespoons of white sugar and beat everything together until creamy you can use a wooden spoon but an electric hand mixer works much better add the egg and vanilla combo and mix everything together really well now gradually add in the flour mixture stir in 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips and if you like 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts evenly spread the cookie dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and wrap it up you absolutely must chill the dough in the refrigerator until it's firm before you use it that'll take at least an hour score the cookie dough into 12 even cubes break off each cube and roll it into a ball then place it on a 14 by 15 inch cookie sheet they really spread out as they cake if your cookie sheet is any smaller you must cook them in two batches bake the cookies in the middle of a 325 degree preheated oven for approximately 17 to 19 minutes or until they just begin to turn golden brown remove the tray from the oven and let the cookies rest for 2 minutes before transferring them from the tray to a cooling rack wrapped up tight in a ziplock bag they'll stay soft and chewy for several days if you can resist them for that long enjoy flour baking soda salt unsalted butter light brown sugar white sugar vanilla and egg semi-sweet chocolate

sheets flipper [Music]", "zeDMaj8RRtM": "hey everybody chef terry again welcome to our and i always have to look this is a huge name for a cookie the disney's raspberry white chocolate chip cookie from pooh corner something else so i haven't been to disney anything since i was probably 10 so disneyland in california somewhere i've never been so i'm sure you guys know this cookie if you've got kids there then i'm sure they they know this cookie but you're both going to love it so let's make sure that you have everything together and everything is measured and ready to roll first thing we want to make sure is that your oven is set to 350 degrees fahrenheit if you're using convection oven i'm not we have the option here but i'm not drop that down to about 320 330 if you can that will sort of even it out you'll get a much better bake that way make sure you have some baking trays with either silpat or silicone mat or parchment paper i have a little rack here to pull the cookies off when it's time you'll need your raspberry jam that's been seedless or take you know use a strainer so you can get as many seeds out of that as possible is what i did this morning we have for our wet ingredients let's just talk about sort of the order that we're going to go in our wet ingredients we're going to start with the mixer we have half of a cup of butter we have half a cup of brown sugar and a quarter cup of white sugar we have one whole egg and one egg yolk okay and we have what is this a teaspoon of vanilla extract i remembered it today i don't have to have everybody running around for me getting it for me today so our dry ingredients we have a cup and a quarter of all purpose flour you can use pretty much any flour you want for this if you're doing a gluten-free cookie then you're going to want to make sure that you're using a baking blend of gluten-free flour we have a small box of white chocolate pudding mix instant pudding mix i was looking around on recipes and i think when they say small box they mean about 3.5 ounces mine was four ounces so i weighed everything really well and it seemed like i took out about two tablespoons you want about three and a half ounces and we also have a half of a teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon of salt i think that's all of our ingredients oh and of course white chocolate chips and dark chocolate chips so make sure all of that is ready and everything is ready to go your oven is heating up the first thing that we're going to want to do is to cream our butter and sugar together and so if you've made cookies you've you've done the creaming method hundreds of times so it's room temperature butter i had to it's not really well it is room temperature here but i have the the air conditioner down to like 60. so i'm a big boy and i sweat so sugar butter okay and leave me something here and your kitchenaid notice i have the paddle attachment you do not want to use your whisk attachment for this it's not going to that's whipping not creaming but make sure that your bowl is locked in heads down lock it and let's start nice and slow and just let the machine do the work excuse me if you're using a hand mixer going to be the exact same thing just keep going i'll be i will be done before you but that's just the difference of not the machine particularly but of the attachment i've never seen a hand mixer that had a paddle attachment it sure would be nice i think it would be impossible to hold on to so you want this to go until it becomes really really fluffy okay this is a majority of the texture you're trying to go for with your cookie oh let there be light and that is looking really good so i'm going to turn it off and let's address getting the egg done yes all the butter and all the sugars okay okay one egg yolk and an egg just crack that into some other container first so that you make sure you don't get any any yo any eggshell in there or you know if you believe that a chicken might fall out then i i guess it happens when some people some people get the right kind of eggs so get that going again i'm going to have to scrape down obviously but while this is running let's put in our vanilla so that is all of our wet ingredients both sugars have been added you and one egg yolk one whole egg one teaspoon of vanilla going to turn that off always turn off your stand mixer before you start scraping down because trust me it's not going to stop if you get your spoon or a spatula or even your hand in there it's not going to stop okay scrape scrape scrape and let's go i'm going to turn this on pretty high we're just going to let it run until and you can see already it's starting to pull from the sides of the bowl and it's pulling them you can see like little fins it's going towards the inside of the paddle it's just where it's pulling it off so the bigger those get the more air you're whipping into it so that's really is what we want and let's turn that off scrape down one more time before we add in our dry ingredients so guys these this is a very very typical cookie recipe in the beginning it's just what we do with it that's going to make it really different so you can use this method for just about anything um if you have put your butter in the microwave and it's melted let it come up to room temperature instead of the other way when we let it come down to room temperature let that come up to room temperature because it really is going to affect the texture next thing i want to do is i want to mix my dry ingredients together just to make sure so reference your recipe guys we have a one and a quarter cup of all-purpose flour we have a small container or a small box or three and a half ounces of white chocolate instant pudding mix that started going teaspoon of sorry a half of a teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon of salt that's kosher salt so the the the volume actually really does matter when it depending on if you're using kosher salt or table salt if you're using table salt use a little bit less i just want to mix this so that i know i'm not going to get clumps of anything that i don't want in the batter because when you're making cookies you always want that cookie to be nice and tender okay the more it beats in the machine is the more tough it's going to become so my little trick when i am adding dry to my ingredients i get my bowl list as close as i possibly can i make a little bit of mess but if i had tried to pour it up here it would have been everywhere i can handle this kind of mess though and we're just going to get this started now cut my mess a little bit more lots of dry ingredients right so we don't want to just turn this machine on high and let it do its thing because it's thing is going to be all over your kitchen and your ceiling and everywhere so once it starts to come together let's mix that and you see it's already together and that's really all i want to do because i want the machine now to incorporate our chocolate so we have white chocolate chips three quarter cup i had very very small chocolate chips which is nice because i like the little itty bitty small ones and i wanted there to be a difference so i'm using slightly less than three quarter cup of my little chips but if you're using the same equal amounts or same equal size chips then make sure they're equal quantities and again i'm not going to just turn this on and walk away just turn it on and off i want it to get mixed together keep an eye on the bottom that's really that's where i'm where i'm looking i'm looking to see that that bottom starts to become incorporated and when it does which it has i'm going to turn it off i'm going to give it one quick spin so that that force will pull a lot of that dough off of the paddle now this is the fun part oh well i don't get to make as much noise as i thought you want to make sure that you're getting this off the paddle waste not one knot dough off let me get this out of our way we won't need it anymore okay here we go what i want to do is just take a spatula a spoon whatever you're using and make sure that that really is together so far so guys so far so good this smells like a delicious chocolate chip cookie very simple ready to add the final bit to it that makes it something super special what i want you to do is take your mixture your dough and i want you to spread it pretty thin just all around the inside of your bowl we are going to add raspberry swirl to this sort of swirl some recipes you'll find may ask you to just put it out on a tabletop which is which is fine everything's cleanable right but then it wants you to scoop and i'm not 100 sure how you're going to scoop from a flat layer of cookies on the counter top look at me i am all that's a good cookie that is a good cookie so you see i have just pushed this up to the sides and you'll see why in just one second how is everybody doing where are you in your in your stage here does anybody have any questions okay okay guys everything is going great now get yourself your raspberry preserves little butter knife and a little spoon oh we do have a few questions okay so we did the creaming method and so most cookies are done like this you're going to start with your flour sorry not with your flour with your butter your sugar or sugars depending on how your recipe is written and if it has it then you're going to add eggs to it and an extract so that's going to be your creaming method in this case i used a half of a cup of room temperature butter half cup of brown sugar quarter cup of white sugar mix those together using a paddle attachment on the mixer when it became nice and fluffy i added my eggs and my vanilla extract and then i turned it back on and let it go until it became really nice and fluffy after that's done turn it off add or combine your dry ingredients and this is what we did here too in this case we had one and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour and a small box of white chocolate instant pudding a quarter teaspoon of salt and a half of a teaspoon of baking soda mix that until it comes together you don't want to over mix and then i added the chips we had three quarter cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and three-quarter cup of white chocolate chips and the raspberry the recipe calls for 3 to 4 tablespoons so we're going to be not putting it in this in tablespoons we're going to be using this little plastic we have tasting spoons here at school so i'm just going to do this and just dab it in there and now you don't want to mix this in or you're going to have you're going to have a raspberry colored and everything flavored dough instead of pockets of raspberry trust me you want these to be in pockets so it's going to be just like you did with the chips you're going to get this pop of flavor so i'm just putting this around trying to trying to stay pretty even not make any huge blobs and i want one up here in the corner too so i ended up using about three tape about four tablespoons so this little container bulk holds a quarter cup so now what i want you to do is take your butter knife it can be a little one if you have one or a big one it's fine and we want to just cut them into the dough like if you were making a raspberry swirl in a cake this is how you would do that and just cut it in i'm not stirring it anything like that i want to bring mine up to the sides because there's a lot in the middle just bring it up to the sides it's not pretty i know they're going to be even more unpretty when we when we get done with all of these just cut cut i promise making cookies hasn't winded me horrible allergies today and i just can't breathe okay to do i'm like i said i'm not going to be stirring this okay i'm cutting it in just making cuts with my little knife so that when i scoop i'll have cookies that have bits of raspberry running through them okay so again whatever you do please don't stir okay and that's all there is to that one of you i'm really curious how that's going to taste that's so good white chocolate dark chocolate brown sugar butter raspberry how can you possibly go wrong with this cookie so the recipe calls for you at some point at this point to make your cookies and put them in the refrigerator you heard me laughing a little while ago about having the temperature of the room down really really low that's because i don't want to have to put these in the in the refrigerator makes a really good beautiful scoop and you see now i have i have worked that dough into my scoop and leveled it out so that when i drop it down on my silicone it's just going to be it'll be perfect i'm going to try to get 12 of these i mean i'm going to try i know for a fact that i can i can put 12. but you see when i'm doing it oh you see you see that one that's going to be the that's going to be the cookie we take a big huge picture of and put it on the wall that's going to be pretty you always want your cookies to be at least an inch and a half two inches apart because they're going to they will expand spread whoops just get that to be part of that one look at that so if i had just stirred this all together with the raspberry it really would just have a raspberry flavor you wouldn't get you wouldn't get this really beautiful cookie let's move this over let me get the other tray so now depending on the size of your cookie scoop of course because i'm sure people are wondering how many of this is going to make from what i understand the the original disney version are made with a half of a cup of dough so that's a huge cookie really huge there's not that many that would not make many in with this recipe so i'm using about a two tablespoon scoop so i'm going to get probably close to 24. and if you've done these classes you know that sometimes i'm bad about just making a tray and then saying i'll make the others later and then you know i don't make them later because i just don't have time but i'm making all of these cookies i know people are gonna love these again notice i am trying to keep my scoop just as clean as i can if you stay clean at all the stages then the cleaning stage at the end is that much easier one more i bet you i can get three more out of this so guys if you're using two tablespoon scoop or if you're just scooping out two tablespoons and then forming these into balls by hand and yum you're going to get going to get probably it was probably going to make 26 27. i am going to stop at this many i'm going to eat that little bit of that dough now what i want to do is i'm going to wet my hands just a little bit and i want to press down on these just just to help them out we just don't want to mound it on top we want to sort of give them direction when they're cooking but notice i'm not smashing them down i'm just just pushing them down so that they're not domed on top it's a little loud whoops i could should have wet my hands a little bit more before i moved on to the second batch that's fine okay look at that now if you want to this is the time directly on the trays you can put these right into the freezer so it's individually frozen and then put them in a bag and you can keep frozen cookies in the in the freezer for a very long time very long time but let's at least bake the first first parts okay again my oven is at 350 degrees non-convection if you're using convection drop that down to about 3 30. so i have my timer set for 10 minutes it's on i would love for us to be able to to continue to hang out so i can pull the cookies out and we can all look at them together but i'm going to need your help to do that so what i'd like you to do is let's have a conversation about cookies let's have a conversation about any kind of food that you're interested in and that way we can we can hang out and talk while our cookies are baking okay so let's hear those questions guys see what's going on we have some oh good let's wait guys so while we're waiting about let that i wanted to tell you about next week starting next week i'm going to have to get a little clarification chef is it starting on tuesday tuesday wednesday and thursday we're having our kids camp our virtual kids camp and it's starting at what time starts at 11 a.m and they're going to go for about an hour almost an hour and a half we have a lot to cover especially if you've been working with us with these recipes that we've been doing for the free virtual kids classes you're really you've got the prime you know you've been primed and you're ready to jump in and make some make some bigger meals some bigger things our culmination is going to be a we're doing nachos we're doing not nachos they're i know we're doing a chicken chicken fajitas tortilla soup and salsa pico de gallo yeah so lots of things oh huh treslicious cupcakes so you have mastered the creaming method now you're ready to make tres leches cupcakes yep we have some questions uh question was do i like almond extract in my sugar cookies yes do i like sugar cookies without almond extract no i feel that they really need something and i really think almond extract is that perfect flavor kind of it gives it a depth it changes the way that it's sweet into something almost a little savory it's a really wonderful extract to go with a sugar cookie and question is will there be more asian recipes definitely so all the chefs here we love to eat and to cook and to write asian recipes so yes yeah we're going to be doing because you know we're we're here we're all in this together we're going to be doing virtual kids camps all summer so and one will be asian facebook will there be more facebook from time to time we're really we're trying to just broaden what we do on the weekends for for adults and families we have zoom classes that we're doing we like to do that for kids too but we want to be able to stay in contact with you guys through facebook as well so one off maybe once a week or so we're going to meet we're going to join together here and make whatever we make whatever you want you guys let us know what you want to do and we're happy to do it right and if you want to come to the kids camps and you're because you're here with us now doing this you register and you're going to get 20 off so and the password for today is cookie c-o-o-k-i-e i can spell cookie i'm glad it wasn't poo's critter corner raspberry something because i would have never been able to spell all that i wanted to look at my cookies though so they're they're doing fine i still have actually i because i'm not using convection on these i want to switch and rotate because we're halfway through if you're switching and rotating what i like to do most ovens have three unless you have my oven at home and it only has two racks but room for more i swear i turn this one around i'm going to get it out of the way very careful please be careful turn these around pull them down now you don't want to cook on the very bottom rack because that's usually that's where all the heat is so bring it so the middle rack went to the top top went to the middle everything got switched around and we do have more questions and my timer is now at four it's at five minutes four out of minutes and 58 seconds so come on let's do this pork loin because there's so little if any fat in a pork loin if you bring it bringing it back up to temperature the first thing that comes into my mind is bring it up to temperature in a sauce that you're going to be using like if you're going to be using it for barbecue just cut it up while it's frozen put it in your barbecue sauce and a pot on the stove and bring it up very very slowly that should that should do it for you what is my favorite dessert i don't have a sweet tooth so my favorite dessert is usually fruit cheese pizza bacon banana pudding chef chef reminded me i don't even think of banana pudding as a dessert it lives in the refrigerator and you just go to it and you just take big huge spoons of it the whole day my sister when we were growing up and probably still to this day she may be watching hi denise if you're there she never wanted a birthday cake she always just wanted a big huge tray of her own banana pudding so yeah i think that's probably pretty common of of people with exceptional tastes in the south what's your favorite savory dish oh my favorite savory dish to cook you know it's and it's going to be to cook and to eat probably it's fried chicken it's an enigma and you know everybody can do it you can find it absolutely everywhere you find it at the grocery stores at the gas station but if you get really good fried chicken is life-changing so i'm always on that quest to find it i'm always on the quest to be able to produce it so and it's fun i mean bad bad fried chicken is still edible oh yeah here in houston and actually the their little saying is world famous gus's world famous fried chicken i don't know where in the world they are but on their cups you can see they're in like 18 cities across the country so all the way here i don't know how far west they go but there's one up in where i used to live in maryland and then they're all the way down here i think they're through like the appalachians so if you were near augusta's fried chicken go don't bother with the sides just get some bread and some fried chicken in sushi i love to make sushi i love to eat sushi when where where so academy cuisine in rockville bethesda maryland so i went late it was my second career and i have i was yeah second career a lot of people are second career chefs so you get done with all of the rigmarole of life in your room and you realize i want to cook i want to cook for people i was always some sort of teacher a performer and teacher and so now i do both so i'm performing for you guys i'm teaching you guys and sorry i'm just looking at the timer we have just a little bit left to go on our cookies so i was a i started out i was a chef at bed at a bed and breakfast i've done high pace crazy restaurant work i've done slow pace bed and breakfast i was a chocolatier for a while and so did all of that moved to houston and started working at main course cooking school teaching and it's been wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful i want to check our cookies what i do want to do we have a little trick that we do here take your cookies out and just give them a little wrap on the table it steps in the background that's not how you do it you whack them but like that okay and that just helps to level out your cookie it helps to flatten it a little bit so i guess i should touch these these are honestly not ready so i'm so the timing from 9 to 11 minutes i want to pop that up to two and a half more minutes to go i think they'll be fine but remember you have to be able to cool your cookies down before you do anything with them so usually you cool them on the tray okay so i see everybody's like busy answering questions do we have any more for me favorite foods oh i think today i'm going to well actually you know what i bought yesterday a pack of chicken wings because i haven't had chicken wings in so long been eating lots of fried chicken we're on a diet at my house so one of us one of us is dieting one of us is not and i decided tonight i wanted chicken wings so i will probably just bake them and just stand over the sink when they're getting nice and cold and i'm just going to eat them so i hear something in the background sorry oops i didn't start my timer i just changed the time but i want these to be just right you don't want to over bake this cookie so you do want it nice and soft so that it just pulls apart what was my first career who asked that my mom um being the world's best son no i mean i wasn't a bad kid but my first career was as a classical musician so i've done everything from gosh singing conducting composing all that kind of good stuff so you know you get to the point where i remember at 19 i wanted to i wanted to cook actually at 19 i wanted my own restaurant i already had the concept had everything in my head but i was already you know two years into classically trained or being classically trained as a singer and just couldn't not do that see where it took me took me all over the world took me to all the big huge opera houses and concert halls you know across western europe and a lot of them here too and that's what i wanted to do for that amount of time the rodent opera decided that it was good made my little mark and then i went to culinary school how do you know when your cookies are done you really do have to test them so let's bring this over and what you want to do is be super careful i almost actually it's not that bad looking but i burned myself just two nights ago at home and not on something that i thought was even going to be hot but i burned myself so please please please be careful and don't burn yourself let's look at this one you see how it's really really still so soft okay especially in the middle it's like it's almost still liquid in the middle and i don't want that i want it to be at least firm to the touch we added because we added that extra jam or because not extra it's part of the recipe but because we added jam to it we've added moisture to this cookie and so it's going to take a little longer to cook that the gelatin the gelatin the jelly needs to needs to set what the water in there it needs to evaporate it needs to be able to cook and be a nice firm cookie otherwise it's just going to it's not going to be pleasant and do remember when you're eating when you're making cookies they're going to be so much better when you just let them cool to room temperature because hot things super cold things neither one has the right flavor that it's supposed to have just right there in the middle it's going to be perfect you're going to get all those flavors so any more questions oh yeah um i had i really lucked out in the beginning and i think one of the reasons i wasn't ready to give it up is because i had wonderful wonderful teachers so the most important person in my life still to this day was my first voice teacher and uh like a second father wonderful wonderful man and then you know you had the organ professors and all that kind of good stuff still the same thing and it's the same thing with with teaching and going to culinary school had an incredible chef in culinary school that really took my hand and led me through she was hard on me she was difficult but she knew that i had something and she wanted to pull it out and really really let it shine let's try again to see so i went for the second rack the first time let's go to the first round how i burned myself please please please again be careful okay i think these are looking good they feel they feel dry and that's really you know i'm not even going to bother with the ones that have the jelly coming out because it's not going to be a real test okay let's put that out let's see if i can get this one out without burning myself and let's see how this one is i'm really going to go for this one oh yeah [Laughter] chef antoinette's like oh yeah that looks good guys she's ready okay so let's let these let these cool get in the habit guys as soon as you're done with your oven turn it off just get in a habit you can see that you know we made a huge mess we made cookies and everything i've cleaned up just along the way and you know everything looks great i have my spatula chef lawrence is listening to some good cookie music in the background kooky music not cookie music just some kooky music okay which one of these should we try to get out of here first guys let yours let yours cool oh i'm tempting fate here but i want us to i want us to have cookies together yeah that one no you know what i'm not i'm not going to ruin these it's not worth it i know i can get this one off i can be sort of judgy about which cookies are going to be the best ones to come off um that might be it might be all i have that are ready to come off of that silpat if you're using parchment paper let these cool for about a minute on the tray and then all you have to do is just take the parchment paper and just lift it off and bring those cookies out onto a cold counter and they're going to cool off much much quicker for you that way i'm going to use my little towel the troops are circling for a cookie oh yeah guys we have a state-of-the-art cookie cooler and the piece of plastic that he's holding [Laughter] so we have to go we do a lot of to-go's now like everybody and so we have these nice thick classic lids it removes a lot of air oh yeah so guys let's let's try to do the math we did 10 minutes and then three more minutes and then a couple of more minutes so we're looking at about 15 minutes for these cookies i wouldn't go over i wouldn't go one minute over that because you still want it you still want them soft okay you just want them cooked no no raw parts in the middle okay so look nice so we didn't we were using a light brown sugar so we don't have a dark cookie at all it's still a very blond cookie i don't want to pick this one up because i know what's going to happen but you can see let's just let's break this baby apart look at that that that is a beautiful tender tender cookie that desperately needs to cool down to room temperature but you know i have to put it in my mouth that's good guys wow like i said i don't have a sweet tooth but that's a good cookie so the next time you're in poo corn or who's corner tell them that you know how to make that cookie this is very good guys i think you want i probably would have used chef lawrence he's stealing some caucus [Laughter] these are cooling off i can just pull out more oh yeah see let's just give them a couple of minutes and they'll pull off this tray really well but guys find one that might be kind of ugly and eat it now i'm gonna give my get myself dizzy trying to get all these cookies off but you know sacrifice one of them just to have it now to sort of hold yourself over now you see this one really doesn't want to come off the spatula yet so just do what you can with it let them cool that's the hardest part to do that's all i'm going to do with that that looks good so guys this is it we've we have gone to poo corner and made some cookies and we're back again um chef lawrence wants me to tell you that he says hello to everybody so i know that on the first couple of the first week or so of the bees that we were doing chef was here with you and um and then i sort of nudged him out of the way and took over thanks for coming and hanging out with

day guys", "cmgjdkXzEDQ": "hello namaste Salaam walekum sorry akahl welcome back to another session with your washer fatwa rava calm chocolate-chip cookies are one of my wife's favorite and she does not like them small slightly bigger so DIF let's go ahead and learn chocolate-chip cookies take 115 grams of butter and hundred grams of powdered sugar mix both of this to a nice creamy consistency add 200 grams of flour and around 2 grams of baking powder okay baking powder just sprinkle all over so it gets easily mixed and if you like to add cocoa powder to your cookies what you can do is instead of Tooele grams of all-purpose flour you can add 150 160 grams of all-purpose flour and the rest like 30 40 grams of cocoa powder you can add in this so that way you will have your chocolate chip cookie slightly dark and the chocolaty looking but I prefer it like this once this is a nicely mixed add around 20 ml of milk in this add vanilla essence and you know mix nicely till it is nice creamy and soft you know you do not want to mix this mixture too much because if you mix this mixture too much then your cookies will become slightly hard so in this we going to add half of the chocolate chips and then gently mix it one more time and then we are going to roll this see there are various methods of making chocolate chip cookies some of them you will put into a ball and it will spread into a flat cookies and this one we are going to roll it into a sheet just sprinkle some flour on the working table now we are going to roll this and then we are going to use a cutting method for these chocolate chip cookies pred the leftover chocolate chips on top of this dough and just very gently roll it not too much that's it otherwise you can even just press it with the hand now take

do not forget Wi-Fi is all about inspiring others to go so please post your cooking recipes and tips at wherever calm so others can benefit from your great cooking thank you", "oXamQySpYsg": "- Today I'm gonna show you how to make one of my favorite treats,\nchocolate chip cookies. These ones are filled with toasted pecans, and I think they strike\njust the perfect balance between a cookie that is\npuffy and cakey on the inside, and those cookies that are\nlike, crispy and crunchy. Personally, I like a crunchy cookie. But, not everyone is like that. So, these are the best compromise you could possibly imagine. And they're so easy to make. Let's get started. Into a bowl, I'm adding\ntwo-and-a-quarter cups, or 270 grams of all-purpose flour, just weigh that out, one teaspoon of salt, and half a teaspoon of baking powder. Just whisk this up really quickly. Distribute those ingredients. Set aside, and now we're\ngonna whip that butter, and do our sugar, egg situation. So into a standing mixer fit\nwith a paddle attachment, I'm adding one cup of unsalted\nbutter at room temperature. I'm using unsalted because\nevery butter manufacturer uses a little bit\ndifferent amounts of salt. And you wanna have a consistent recipe. So control the salt by\nusing unsalted butter, and then adding the salt in yourself. Okay, into that bowl. Now let's cream it up. I'm adding in a\ncombination of regular old, plain granulated sugar, and then light brown sugar. If you add in just plain sugar, you will spread out, be really thin. If you add in a lot of brown sugar, it will be kind of puffier\nand closer together. And it will also have that caramel taste from the brown sugar. But I like to add a combination. You could go back and forth, depending on how you\nwant your cookie to be. So, half a cup of\ngranulated sugar, mix it up, and then one cup of\npacked light brown sugar. This one I'm actually gonna\nbreak up a bit with my fingers, because there's a couple of\ngiant sugar chunks in there. Much easier to do this than\ntrying to make your mixer do the work for you. Tenderly adding those\ncalories in just for you. It smells so nice. This reminds me of the ice teas I used to make myself when I was little, like those Lipton Ice Tea mixes. It's like sugar, a little ice\ntea powder, water and ice. Oh, the 80s. Whip it up until it's\nfluffy, incorporated, you know what to do. (upbeat music) That went over for like a second or two. Now let's tap this down. Things got a bit crazy in two eggs. I like it. Now we're gonna add in\ntwo eggs and our vanilla. Just add one egg, let it mix, add the other egg, let\nit mix and incorporate, otherwise it gets a bit messy. (upbeat music) Two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Okay now you have that nice\nbeautiful buttery paste that you're used to from cakes. I could totally just eat this, like as is. I'm disgusting like that. But I won't 'cause I have a recipe to do. Now we're gonna add our flour mixture, and mix it until just combined. Don't wanna overmix. And then I'll hand-fold in\nall of the other ingredients. (upbeat music) I'm very excited. I have to tell you something though. I love a burnt, crispy cookies. I like roasted Brussels sprouts. I like bitter things. Yes I love desserts, but I\nlove like a burnt cookie. I'll often accidentally burn something. My husband, however, only\nlikes those soft, pillowy, fluffy, cloudy, cake cookies that I hate. So, we'll see how these turn out. That is, a couple of\npockets of flower in there, but we'll deal with it by hand. Now it's time to add in\nthe two magical ingredients that will make this cookie amazing: One, a cup of toasted, chopped pecans. You could also use toasted walnuts, if you have a nut allergy,\nor you don't like nuts, you can skip it too, and there'll\nbe chocolate chip cookies. The other one is gonna be two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. Once again, maybe semi sweet's\na bit too sweet for you, you could add bittersweet\nchocolate chips in, or if you don't like chocolate, why are you watching this video? Okay, so one cup of\nchopped, toasted pecans. If you wanna toast pecans or any nut, 350 on a baking sheet, spread 'em out, and then bake for like five minutes. Take it out using an oven\nmitt, don't burn yourself, then move the nuts around, put it back in for like\nanother five minutes. Those outer nuts will always\ncook first, or toast first. All right, in you go, one cup of chocolate chips. All right now, here's\nanother hint for you. If you can get a metal spatula, doesn't have to be copper,\nbut metal, this will work. Because if you make cookies a lot, and you're folding those\ningredients by hand, you will snap the wooden ones. It's happened to me. I went right back to the\nstore, got an exchange. (upbeat music) I'm adding the cookie dough\ndirectly onto my baking sheet. I'm not bothering with chilling it. You could chill it, make\nahead, keep it in your fridge for a special treat. They won't spread out as much. They'll be a little bit puffier, but you and I know, I\ndon't like those cookies. My actual dream cookie, which\nI wouldn't make for you, because it's too specific, would be this thin, like super flat, crispy, crunchy, caramelized. Okay, right on there. My worst nightmare, those\ndisgusting oatmeal cookies. Oh, yuck. My mom actually, hasn't\nmade them in years, but she makes this amazing oatmeal cookie. It's like paper-thin, super crispy, I made that recipe. That's a good video. Make sure you give these guys space, because they will be spreading out. I'm using a one-and-a-half\ntablespoon ice cream scooper. It's really nice for getting\na nice, uniform cookie, and not getting too messy. (upbeat music) Okay, our first batch is ready. And we're gonna bake\nthese at 350 Fahrenheit, or 177 Celsius, for eight to 10 minutes, or until golden brown on the outside. They'll still be soft on the inside. It's kind of up to you. You can burn them if you want. All right. Our of the over, just\ncool enough to handle. And I have bad news. I did not really burn any. I was hoping like, on the corners, they'd be like really caramelized. But this is the best we're gonna get. It's fine. The sacrifices I make. Okay, I'm very excited to cut into this, especially since I haven't had lunch yet. God I'm so hungry. All right, what? So nice. Mmm. That is like very, it's nice\nand chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside. If you wanna make these\nthe flat, crispy cookies that I would like, just\nuse the regular sugar, skip the brown sugar, and then burn 'em. (laughs) All right. Thanks so much for watching.

a double shot of extra chocolaty goodness it's my double choc chip cookies I'm not one part chef to make our cookies we're going to need 125 grams of softened butter I'm using unsalted butter but you can use salted if you wish I'll just find an unsalted is better in dessert recipes half a cup of plain white sugar half a cup of brown sugar and about a teaspoon of vanilla using an electric mixer we're just going to cream the butter and the sugars together in a cup I've got one egg which I've just lightly beaten with a fork and I'm going to add a small amount of the egg into the mixture beat that in with the electric mixer and then add a bit more until it's all integrated we're going to sift in some flour I'm putting in 1 and 3/4 cups of self-raising flour now if you don't have self raising flour you can use plain flour and add a teaspoon of baking powder and of course chocolate chips I've got 125 grams of chocolate chips half milk chocolate half white chocolate I'm just going to pour them in and using a wooden spoon we're just going to mix this all together and sokka moment that's our cookie dough made it so let's start making some cookies I've lined in a baking tray with some baking paper and using a tea spoon we're going to take two spoonfuls of the cookie dough mixture and we're just going to roll it in our hands like so until you've got a little ball place the ball on the tray and keep going our first batch of cookies are ready to go into the oven into a preheated oven 180 degrees Celsius for about 10 to 12 minutes or until they flattened out and gone lightly golden and then we'll be ready to see the final result this is our first batch of cookies out of the oven and they literally just come out of the oven and the whole place smells amazing now leave them on the train for about two to three minutes or so just to let them cool off slightly and start to firm up and then you can gently transfer them onto a wire rack and here are our finished cookies looking absolutely gorgeous now you'll notice some lighter and some of them a darker and I've done this by design these ones here are obviously lighter they've been in the oven for about 10 to 12 minutes and these darker ones were put in for a couple more minutes longer the lighter ones are softer and chuyia while the darker ones are crispier and crunchier so it's all down to personal taste so speaking of personal taste let's try one YUM hmm you've got that lovely hit of vanilla from the white chocolate and of course that beautiful milk chocolate and it's just a beautiful crispy delicious cookie how could you ask for anything more well I hope you've enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one five chef show comm and until next time see you later", "NEQgPgW_ETM": "hi I'm Stephanie drawers gave joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate fudge cookies the outside of this cookie is really shiny and cracked yet when you break one open you will find it really soft and fuzzy inside and I really love the intense chocolate flavor of this cookie and that is because the batter contains lots of melted dark chocolate in fact you will need one pound that's 450 grams of dark chocolate now you can use either a semi-sweet or a bittersweet chocolate just use a good quality one that you enjoy just eating on its own and it will need to be coarsely chopped now you can do that on a cutting board with a sharp knife or you could even just put it in your food processor and process it and then put it in a heatproof bowl along with a quarter of a cup that's four tablespoons our 57 grams of butter you can use either salted or unsalted and I like to have it at room temperature and then just cut it into pieces so it melts a little faster and then just put your bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and then just let it melt until it's nice and smooth okay our chocolate is now all melted so just remove it from the heat and just put it aside because we want to let that cool to room temperature and then now we'll start the batter so if you have an electric stand mixer like I do just use a paddle attachment or you could just use an electric hand mixer with a large bowl now this batter is a little different for most cookie batters usually what you do is you just create the butter with the sugar and then add the eggs and the flour this batter is more like a chocolate torte or a sponge cake in that we are going to beat the eggs with the sugar first so you will need four large eggs have them at room temperature so what I do is I just bought a half-hour before I'm about to start I just take the eggs out of the refrigerator and just leave them on the counter to warm up a bit so just put that in your mixer along with one and three-quarter cups that's about 350 grams of granulated white sugar and now we're going to beat this on high speed until it's really thick and pale yellow kind of like whipped cream and that's going to take depending on your mixer somewhere around five minutes okay this is what you're looking for you can see it's a very pale yellow and see how it's very thick and when it kind of goes back into ribbons sits on the surface for a second and then disappears into the rest of the batter so that's what you're looking for so now we're going to just beat in one tablespoon of pure vanilla extract try to use a pure it's a lot better than the imitation ones okay so now for the rest of our ingredients we're going to add the chocolate next but then after that we're going to add half a cup that's about done 60 grams of cake flour now if you don't have cake flour you could just use a plain white flour and then to the cake flour I'm going to add 1 teaspoon of baking powder that will give our cookies just a little rise 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt and I'm going to add a 1 teaspoon of either an instant espresso powder and instant coffee now that'll just give you a little bit of a coffee flavor you could add more if you like a stronger coffee flavor or you could just leave it out if you don't like coffee and then just whisk that together as you can see this is like a chocolate torte in that there really isn't for all the amount of batter there is just a little bit of flour flour just give it a little bit of texture and then for we're going to fold in more chocolate 1 cup 240 milliliters of dark chocolate chips or I have some chunks here I'm going to add 1 cup 240 milliliters of white chocolate chips and then one cup of chopped nuts now I'm using walnuts here you could use pecans almonds hazelnuts whatever you want if you want to toast the nuts just put them in a 350 degree Fahrenheit 180 degrees Celsius oven for about 810 minutes just until you start to smell the nuts and they turn so the light brown and then let them cool and then chop them coarsely now if you want to vary this if you don't want if you would like to add maybe some toffee bits or butterscotch chips or maybe milk chocolate replace that if you want to add some dried fruit you don't want to add you just kind of mix and match maybe I haven't tried this but I would think see some mini marshmallows would be very good kind of make a rocky road type cookie so just have fun with that an experiment so now back to our batter so the our chocolate has now melted and cooled we want it nice and cool because we don't add a hot chocolate to our batters just make sure touch it and make sure it's cool and then I'm just going to add that to the batter okay and just beat this in on slow speed just until it's all mixed in oh sure now what I'm going to do is I'm going to transfer this to a larger bowl so you can really see what I'm doing here so just make sure that chocolates all mixed in I'm just using the rubber spatula to use a whisk as well like so just make sure that chocolates all mixed in there and then I'm going to add the flour just gently do it we don't want to deflate we beat a lot of air in the eggs so we don't want to deflate that too much and then when it's almost mixed in then start adding all of your other good ingredients these would be really nice to give as gifts they're so unusual in the way they look and their taste nice treat for people okay so there we go now this as you can see is a little soft to form into cookies so what we're going to do is just cover it and put it in the fridge now depending on your fridge it could take a half hour you know to a couple hours you could even do it overnight but just until it's some firm enough that we can form it into cookies so we're now ready to make our chocolate fudge cookies so pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and then line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper and then what I like to do is make circles so I can form the cookies into the exact same size for everyone so what I do is take like either a three to three and a half inch round cookie cutter which is like nine nine centimeters and then just use a pencil or a pen just trace around and then you can see I have six circles here and then just flip your paper over and then you can still see that's a good guide I mean once you kind of get used to the exact size because you want everyone the same size you don't have to do that but that's for the beginner that's a good idea so then this is our batter I just chilled it for maybe half an hour so as you can see it's kind of dulled and when I press it it's still little soft but it's it's firm enough now to form into cookies so I'm using a quarter cup ice cream scoop 60 milliliters if you don't have one of these you could just use a quarter cup 60 milliliter measuring cup and then just so as you can see it's still a little soft so just nice generous quarter cup just tried put in the center of that circle as you can see these are going to make monster cookies I mean you could always make them smaller if you want but we're making the large ones and then have a little cup with some water and just kind of just get your hands a little damp and then we're just going to press this down into about the guide line of your circle and wipe your hands off as you need to okay so I'm baking time this is really critical for this some cookie we don't want to over bake them because then they'll be dry what we want is the what you're looking for is the outside to be set it's still shiny but you'll see cracks form just start to form on the top of the cookie so I'm depending on like when you just chill the dough a little like I did for half an hour I'm going to say somewhere within the ten to fourteen minutes if your dough is really cold it'll take longer but what always check like a couple minutes before if you want to catch these when these the surface is still shiny and the cracks are starting to form okay our chocolate fudge cookies are now done as you can see the tops are wonderfully nice and cracked ER but there's still you can see there's still little shine to them so you really have to let these cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack because they're really fragile right now so I would say at least ten minutes before you transfer them like I have I did a few test cookies which you may want to do just to kind of get my baking time right so this is what you're looking for as you can see this is these ones have cooled a little more very nice cracked still shiny and yet when I break it open you can still see it's really soft inside that's what you're looking for so these are wonderful and they're at their best the day they are made but you could cover them store them at room temperature for several days or you can even pop them in the freezer so until next time I'm Stephanie Dworsky of joy baking calm", "Yfl8gJxq9G4":

alaikum and welcome to titli's busy kitchen with me titli nihaan I've already shown you how to make chocolate chip cookies and this time I thought I'd kick it up a notch by making chocolate chocolate chip cookies or chocolate chip cookies as I like to call them now for artistic reasons I'm going to use white chocolate chips and create the inverse of a regular chocolate chip cookie for my chocolate chip cookies I've got 125 grams of melted butter 170 grams of plain flour 75 grams each of brown and white sugar 125 grams of white chocolate chips 40 grams of cocoa powder and egg half a teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla essence mix the butter and the sugar in a large bowl adding a tablespoon of milk a vanilla essence and the egg then mix now adding the salt and baking soda the cocoa powder and sifting the flour then mix and you should end up with this lovely thick dough now mixing the chalk chips this dough is actually pretty thick I'm just going to pop it in the fridge for half an hour while I get the oven up to temperature the consistency of this dough is like a soft fudge so I'm going to take dollops of about a tablespoon in size and put them onto this baking sheet make sure you leave plenty of space between the dollops because these things are going to spread out that looks quite savory doesn't it anyway I'm going to bake these at a hundred and eighty degrees C for eight to ten minutes I always check my chocolate chip cookies after eight minutes because usually my oven they're cooked now I'm going to leave these for five minutes to cool after five minutes carefully remove them onto a wire rack to finish cooling chocolate white chocolate chip cookies get him down your neck dropped off chip cookies chocolate

Justin Jam I'm going to be showing you guys how to make these strawberry cream cheese cookies with white chocolate chunks I'm not even kidding these are the most refreshing cookies I've ever eaten so without further ado let's get this party started sorry that's really annoying anyway so what you're going to need is one and a quarter cup of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/8 teaspoon of salt a quarter cup of softened unsalted butter four ounces of softened cream cheese 3/4 of a cup of sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 3/4 cup of chopped fresh strawberries 2 tablespoons of lemon juice 1 to 2 tablespoons of flour and 5 ounces of chopped white chocolate so first what you're going to want to do is breed the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line your pans with parchment paper which I might have forgotten to do and then after you created your oven pour the lemon juice over the strawberries and give it a mix after you mix it set it aside for a few minutes whisk together the flour salt and baking powder until it's combined and set aside in a large bowl add the butter cream cheese and sugar and beat until its latest lovely haha fluffy fluffy now this part may be challenging for all you weaklings out there so if you can't do this with ease like me don't be discouraged at the egg and vanilla and mix well add the flour mixture gradually and mix until it's well combined now if you stop beating the butter and cream cheese was hard you might as well stop now because you're simply not strong enough for this recipe just kidding no but seriously this part is actually really hard next you're gonna want to stir in the white chocolate now drain the strawberries that you cut up earlier now sprinkle the strawberries with the flour and toss them until all the strawberries are coated now stir the strawberries into the batter really gently drop heaping tablespoons of batter onto the pan leaving an inch of space in between each cookie set the cookies in the refrigerator for five to ten minutes before being baked for 13 to 15 minutes or until the edges become golden brown now you have yummy and pretty cookies for strawberry season or other occasions too thanks for watching see you next time on justin jams", "O9bWF_UKQeY": "hi everybody everybody I'm back and today today Junie young is going to show you all how to make mouth-watering

hour and they're room temperature it doesn't take long to get your butter to room temperature all right so you need that tablespoon of the Crisco you have to use it it's gonna give you a crispy experience it's gonna help to give your cookie a nice crispy feel to it it's you're still gonna have a nice soft cookie but you're gonna have some crisp around the edge and some crisp around the bottom that makes that absolute perfect cookie trust me when I tell you this okay so there's our butter we have our Crisco as well let me bring our mixer close so y'all can see down into the mixer in this manner I pre crack my eggs because you don't want to put your eggs into you don't want to crack them into your bowl because there's a chance that you can get eggshells in them so you crack them into something separate that way you can make sure that you have fresh eggs and that there's no eggshells there's the butter in the crystal now we're going to go in with our sugar OOP I spilt a little bit of sugar so what I will do is I'll grab a little bit more sugar and put it in there okay everybody let's start to mix up your butter your sugar your vanilla and then once you get your butter and sugar nice and creamed and let me tell you what cream dis cream means at least this is what my grandmom would tell me when my grandmom would be making a pound cake she would have me cream the butter and sugar with the wooden spoon in a bowl and she would say honey can you mix this and I'd be mixing it and I say is this enough and she say nope I say well how come and she said cuz I can still hear the sugar in there and I would be thinking oh my gosh like it would feel like eternity but really honestly you know as a kid it would feel like eternity but when you're just when you're doing it this way or you're mixing it with the handheld mixer or even by hand it doesn't take long you do want to mix it until you can't hear the sugar anymore okay so let's turn this on and get that going remember that we have the shortening in here as well a little bit so that everything can get well incorporated together and you want to go in a few times and take your rubber spatula and just scrape everything down [Music] that's like so everything that I'm making this kitchen you all can do as well and it's going to turn out perfect you hear me Oliver's book requires with a little bit of patience hey listen here if you can have patience in that kitchen you're gonna have some good food you hear me absolutely you will okay so I'm gonna turn it down because this is doing just perfect what I'd like to do let's go ahead and lift it up now and I would like to scrape the sides down like I said you don't have to have the stand-up mixer to do this you can do this by hand and that's gonna turn out as well as well as this one okay scrape your sides down so everything can get well incorporate it together just like this and we're just gonna cream this for maybe another two minutes or so and then we'll put our vanilla noir eggs when's the last time you all had a nice homemade cookie especially a oat milk cookie I iced cookie I can't wait to sink my teeth down into these bad boys okay this is beautiful you can't the sugar is nice and silent the butter no oil and the sugar is well incorporated everything looks nice and fluffy so then we're gonna put our egg in just like so put your other one in get all that goodness down into there as well as your vanilla those of you that are familiar with me you know I'll tell you to use a certain amount of vanilla and I go way over the measurements I love vanilla you have to forgive me for that every time I get my hands on that vanilla I pour extra in on purpose because I love it I love the flavor and I love the smell let's mix this let's see it looks like I need to scrape the sides down just a bit and then we'll proceed there we go that's what you want baby we want everything well incorporated oh yeah okay everybody now to the flower this is our teaspoon of baking soda this recipe does not require baking powder baking soda only and the flour that we're using is all-purpose flour get that well incorporate it just like so and then we're gonna mix our three cups of dried oats right on the end mix it up with your flour and your baking soda we're gonna put a pinch of sea salt in just a pinch of sea salt and really a lot of people don't understand why someone would put salt in the cookie it's because it honestly it brings out the flavors trust me when I tell you this okay it brings out the flavor in the cooking and makes an absolutely amazing taste this right here is the cinnamon and I like to have a nice amount of cinnamon in mines so I'm just gonna kind of eyeball it just like so I can't wait to share this recipe with you all in the hopes that you all will cook it and let me know what you think about this recipe right yeah this recipe right here mmm you hear me now listen here this is very crucial when you mix in this part I don't want you all to mix this forever it doesn't take long because once you once you start to see everything well incorporate it we're going to throw those cranberries in we're gonna throw those white chocolate chips in and then we're done then we're done and it really is that simple here's the thing you can have the kids do this part for you it's so simple so easy lots of fun okay pull in there you can do it half in half if you want it to you know a little bit in hopes and it won't fly all over my face I know I get silly in here let's start it on low so that don't get a big poof of flour just like this nice and easy nice and easy okay let's turn it off I don't want to mix it too much wanna be gent this is almost like when you're dealing with hamburgers you don't want to mix your hamburger too much because you'll cause a a tough hamburger that's how it is with this oatmeal cookie you don't want to mix it too much all right just a little bit just a little bit I'll do it yet all right now we're gonna make sure that our flour gets well incorporated absolutely we are okay but we're not gonna mix it too much go ahead and put your this is 1 cup of my white chocolate morsels and then I'm gonna use 1 cup of cranberries as well you all never have this before you gotta make me some absolutely you should make you so this right here is definitely something to ride home about I got some cookies I'm gonna take on my trip this week they're bad boys up in a ziplock bag and we're gonna enjoy ourselves absolutely all right let's see this here can you turn it up on the high just for a second that's all we need for a mixing process this right here I can mix it with my little spatula and our cookies our cookie dough is made and it is I gotta taste it I have to taste it I know there's people out there that say no Dena don't do it the raw egg no dear don't do it I want to I will ha ha ha I will I always ever since I was a kid I loved eating the dough the cookie dough off the beaters - cake dough and I still do it today I'm still alive I'm still alive and healthy and when my kids want to lick that that egg this beater here I give it right to them and they're just fine it's the truth it's the truth ok so let's take this off I'm gonna show you you don't have to refrigerate this before you start to roll it out either we're gonna take a teaspoon just like this maybe a little over a teaspoon we're gonna shake these bad boys just like this and we're gonna put them on to our cookie sheet the oven is already preheated and I'm gonna show you all how to make this very quick and simple coconut flavored glaze that we're gonna ice our cookies with be right back okay everybody let's get started so now take your tea spoon if you want to make these really big you can look at this what I want you to see I want you to see the chocolate morsels going all throughout and those beautiful cranberries whoo-whee boy do we have one delicious one delicious cookie recipe right here look at this look at that goodness look how beautiful this is all right if you wanted to use parchment paper absolutely you can use the parchment paper if you're afraid that they might stick to your pan and you see I'm not dealing with them a lot I'm not home or anything like that just kind of grab you some just kind of scoop you some up and do just a little press is all you need to do and that's it you have cookies this cookie dough can be saved you can wrap it up in parchment paper and roll it up just like the cookie dough that you would buy from the stores you will put it in the freezer or the refrigerator and you would have cookie dough for a later date absolutely really it's that simple really it's that simple if any of your cookies happen to stick together because honestly sometimes that happens you know they spread out during the cooking process if that happens just let your cookies cool down and then you take a spatula and just cut them apart you know things happen when you're cooking but I tell you one thing these bad boys is gonna be good you hear me all I need all I need is a little bit of ice and milk to go with these bad boys and I am ready I am ready to go mmm girl you don't did you know outdid yourself once again Gina make sure to tell all your friends and your loved one about Gina young and what Gina young is doing in this kitchen every day every day every day except for Sunday let them know let them know get the word out there tell your friends and family check my channel out absolutely because I have a recipe for each and every person out there that wants to cook something everybody that wants to cook something I have a recipe for you you hear me absolutely I do I have the time for you this just like this now I'm gonna do this little pan that I have beneath me off camera and then we'll throw them in the oven and then once we get these in the oven I'll show you how to make this coconut flavor icing that is absolutely amazing it's so simple and listen here it tastes so good do you hear me who are you hearing me mmm I know you do I know you do these cookies right here I told you all in my last video I was coming back for redemption on these cookies the last cookies I tried to make I couldn't save the video and I wasn't able to upload it these are my Redemption oatmeal cookies that's why they're gonna turn out so amazing they're gonna be nice and soft and they're gonna have a crispy outer edge crispy bottom they're gonna be so flavorful do you hear me my goodness I'm gonna finish doing this tray right here and I'll be right back okay both trays are done these are going in the oven and I want to keep a nice eye on them if you're that person that likes it really really really crispy cookie all over then you cook your cookies a little bit longer until they turn to you know a darker brown color but be sure not to burn them now listen here I like mines much lighter I'm gonna wait so once I see a nice a really vague brown color around the sides I'm gonna take mine's out because they'll continue to cook on the cookie sheet for that five minutes that you have them on the cookie sheet because once you take these out you don't want to go in with your spatula right away taking them off because you'll break them they're they'll tear they have to literally set a little bit and get a little bit harder before you can take them off of your tray so I'll let you know exactly how long I cook these in the oven okay portable fireplace where did you get it from well I got it from a place called home buys but you can also find this on Google it's portable it has a battery pack so you don't have to fuss with the with the cord and it's awesome it's like the cutest thing you can put it wherever you want if you want to put it on your front porch with you if you want to put it in a certain room wherever you go you can take it along take it on trips things like that it's a great it's really cute but that's where I got it from because I heard a lot of you say where can I buy mine look online and you'll find you one or go to home buys coconut flavored icing is what we're gonna cover our beautiful cookies with I have some powdered sugar here I have a cup and a half you really don't have to measure this when you do this put your coconut flavouring if you wanted to use maple flavoring any flavoring that you wanted to use but I don't suggest that you use a flavoring that's brown in color like our vanilla was because the reason why is because your icing will turn out a funky color you you don't want to brown icing right so don't make now you can buy vanilla that is clear in color this here is the coconut flavoring get you some in there all right I'm gonna use a tiny bit of milk guys when I say a tiny bit just a tiny bit all right and once any liquid hits this powdered sugar it automatically turns into a quick glaze watch this watch this all you need is a little bit of liquid a little bit of liquid goes a long way whether that would be lemon juice milk water okay now we're gonna put a little bit more until we get the consistency that we're looking for if you make yours a little too wet hey it's okay don't worry guess why because you can always add powdered sugar to it okay this right here it smells absolutely amazing and all I need to really do is make a little bit let me give this a taste and see if this is the flavor that I'm looking for Oh oh my goodness isn't here listen here you all never had coconut icing coconut glaze it's the bee om be calm the bomb calm it's amazing I'm telling you one thing normally when I make my glaze I'll put lemon in there and I thought that was amazing listen here do it this way this right here is so delicious try the coconut try the milk let me know what you think this icing right here is gonna be amazing on these cookies see that there and here's the thing if you need some more you can whip up some more in two minutes you know cuz it doesn't take any longer than two minutes all right we're just waiting on our cookies our cookies are in the oven and they're baking and I'll be right back our cookies are baking in the oven just beautifully they've only been in there for about six minutes but I'm keeping a good eye on them we have beautiful oatmeal cookies these cookies cook for 10 minutes and I took them out like I said if you're that person and want yours a little bit more crispy or a little bit more darker than you leave a man but be careful now look here 10 minutes did me perfect this right here is gonna be

goodnight mmm that's a good cookie", "BLlNxwkQ-W8": "hey guys so that will be sharing a very easy recipe called triple chocolate cookies for the ingredients we need one teaspoon of vanilla one egg 1/3 cup of white granulated sugar 1/2 a cup of packed brown sugar 3 tbsp of touch process cocoa powder 1/2 a teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of baking powder one teaspoon of baking soda one and a half cups plus one tablespoon of plain flour and 125 grams of room-temperature butter for the chocolate chips this is dark chocolate half a cup white chocolate half a cup and milk chocolate half a cup to begin combine the flour the cocoa powder the baking soda the baking powder and the salt give it a mix that is aside we will sift this later in a bowl beat the butter so these were going to add the brown sugar and the white sugar as well give it a mix until it is combined add one teaspoon of vanilla continue mixing at this point we can add in the egg stop to scrape down the beater and the side of the bowl now we can sift in the dry ingredients to begin mixing use the spatula first just cut the butter through the dry ingredients and the fully a mix this use the handheld mixer as you can see the dough is quite dry but that's okay it will come together do not overmix this at this point we can add in the chocolate chips so I'm adding the milk chocolate the dark chocolate and the white chocolate use your hands to lightly knead the dough this is quite a stiff dough so just lightly knead it until it comes together once it comes together you can cover this with cling wrap and let it rest in the fridge for one-and-a-half to two hours for me I'm going to put it in a cling wrap form it into like a sausage so it will be easier for me to divide them later this is this step is optional I'm gonna cover this again with another I'm cling-wrap just double seal it so after about one and a half hours I already preheated my oven at 180 degree Celsius divide your dough according to the size that you like for me I'm going to weigh each one about 70 grams each so it's quite a big cookie the size of your cookie depends how big you want it to be again pre-heat your oven at 180 degree Celsius so once she divided all the dough form the dough into a ball [Music] so in each baking tray I lined it with parchment paper I put five of the cookie dough and then I'm going to bake this in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for about twelve to fourteen minutes this is how what it looks like after baking let it cool down on the tray before moving it into a wire rack if you want to put extra chocolate on top of the cookies to make it prettier you can do so and this is the finished product this cookie is so easy to make and it's very delicious I hope you give this a try with 70 grams I made about 13 cookies so they're quite big cookies and just to show you what it looks like inside the outside that's very crispy and the inside is very soft and you can really taste the chocolate inside it is really delicious best eaten within the day that you bake them but if you are put it in a tightly sealed container it can last for three to four days thank you so much for watching and I hope you give this a try I'll see you again next week bye", "IGSKiMpYuMw": "now we're gonna start with one stick of butter and you know when you're making cookies I am learning a lot from the pastry chefs and the other chefs I work with is softened butter is the key so if you're thinking that you know if you think it's Friday and you want to make cookies on Saturday pull those that butter additi out of the fridge and just leave it on the counter and that'll be just perfect so we were actually we pulled this out this morning and after a couple hours softens right up but that really is key when it comes to making great cookies so one stick of softened butter and then I've got half a cup of brown sugar and a quarter cup of just regular white sugar and I'm gonna cream those together full recipes on our website so don't worry about writing everything down right now so we're gonna cream our butter and sugar together until it's nice and fluffy now always two things going on when we do cookies we've got our dry ingredients and then we've got our butter and sugar and our wetter ingredients in two different things so I've got a cup and a quarter of flour just regular old white flour it's got a half teaspoon of salt I'm using kosher salt I fell in love with kosher salt and once you just start you know it's not expensive it's in the same place as the regular salt at the grocery store comes in a box and you know the chef's that I work with have gotten me hooked on kosher salt for baking when you're you know seasoning meats all that kind of good stuff and then 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda so I really want to have my butter and my sugar is be a little bit fluffy so I'm gonna give them a little bit more time and by all means if you have a great cookie recipes I need to know about it don't keep it a secret that's the one thing I do love to bake you know on the weekends Sunday afternoon Ireland will say to me hey mom let's make cookies and for years and years and years my kid this is embarrassing my kids thought homemade cookies came from the roll in the refrigerator you know if their refrigerator kind that you sliced off and one day Ireland said to me mom seriously I think we can do this and we've been making homemade Chuck's of cookies ever since so not that those roll of cookies in the refrigerator don't come in handy every once in a while so it looks great my my butter and my sugar are starting to get a little bit fluffy I'm gonna add one egg I was daring there at home I'll usually crack it right into a bowl just to make sure especially if Ireland's in the kitchen with me we don't want to get any shell into the cookies and then a teaspoon of vanilla that's perfect at home I don't have one of these fancy kitchen aides I just use a hand mixer so if you don't have one of these don't worry about it hand mixer works great so I'm going to add my flour in here I do it kind of gradually in batches got the apron on today so I'm not wearing white after I get done with this and now I can add the rest of that flower let's get that going in there now this doesn't make a real big batch this is kind of the perfect batch to make on a Sunday when you you know it's just for the family so if you're gonna be taking these to work or you want a whole bunch of cookies definitely double this batch okay that looks great our dough is all combined there so the last thing we're gonna do is we're making white chocolate macadamia nut cookies which I actually have a favorite cookie place if you've ever been to Harbor Springs Michigan which I was born in a little town right near they are called Petoskey Michigan it's about five hours away and we have a cottage over there and it's just a magical place got a lot of fond memories over there but there's this little teeny and this is the good kind of eatin dough - but I'll be well-behaved don't lick the spatula or the beat or anything like that there's this little teeny cookie shop and they get rated they're getting written up all the time is one of the best chocolate chip cookies in the country it's called Tom's mom's cookies and they make a mean white chocolate macadamia nut but their original Tom's bon mom's cookie is just a Chocolate Chunk cookie and it seriously is one of the best cookies I've ever had but people come from all over the country and it's like I say this little peach colored house and you'd never know that they cranked out some of the best cookies ever so if you get the hardware Springs Mississippi Michigan or if you've ever been there email me let you let me know it is a great little place kind one of those tucked away little secrets but one time I was walking downtown and Harbor Springs it's just a quaint little town kind of like a Norman Rockwell little town and these people from England said where's the cookie place and I'm not doing a very good accent but yeah people just go there for the cookies alright so I'm gonna take my macadamia nuts these beautiful macadamia nuts and I don't want to put them in their hole I've got about a cup and I just want to snatch them up a little bit you still want to know that they're in there but the whole nuts are a little bit big so just crush them up a little bit and then I've got one cup of white chocolate chips and it's that easy if you can find though the white chocolate chunks those would be great too all right so let's start making these cookies just gonna use a spatula to get the nuts in there and the chips preheated oven is also key and everybody's oven is different so you probably know what temperature your oven cooks cookies best at home I do mine at like 325 that here in the studio we do a good 350 and the best way to do the cookies really I found are these scoops but also fallen in love with these scoops that you can get at this Elm right at cooks corner and they make just they make making cookies so much easy easier and then parchment paper I mean I you know even wants to be cleaning up you know the pans this is like so wonderful it's just not a big deal at all you just find it with the saran wrap and the tin foil right in that aisle and just cut it to fit your pans and we use this all the time when we're making cookies makes cleanup a breeze so you can just drop this and this makes nice big cookies picturing leave some space in between just had a big bake sale you've been hearing me talk about that for Ireland's Girl Scout Troop and sure I should have made these these sort of cells I was like the queen of cupcakes I did like 12 dozen cupcakes I never want to see another cupcake again for a while but next time I'll have to do these white chocolate macadamia nut cookies so it's that easy if you want to you can press them down a little bit but these turned out perfectly again we got them into our 350 degree oven don't overcook your cookies just like you know when you are toasting nuts cookies continue to bake once they're out of the oven so you know and once you overdo it man there's nothing worse than burning two batch of cookies so keep a close eye on them at least take about 10 to 12 minutes and pull them out even if they're a little bit you don't think they're done because they'll continue to bake on that cookie sheet so in these will go out mine come and they're gorgeous and that person paper cookies slide right off keeps your pans really nice to you invest in those great cookie sheets oh shoot I'll have to have that last one my white chocolate macadamia nut cookies they're absolutely fabulous recipes on our website you can also pick it up at any festival foods and we're just getting this whole party started we're gonna have a ton of fun today and make a lot of things", "vOqlnUs_LaI": "Hello everyone welcome to my kitchen

I've got two baking trays and I have lined them with non-stick baking\npaper I will take 1 tablespoon of the duo\nat a time if you take this size then it roughly\ngives you around 20-25 cookies this doe you can just change\nthis mixture and kind of do your own thing you can add white chocolate to this you can add dark chocolate milk chocolate I'm keeping a bit of distance between\nthem because

ideas then do\nsubscribe to my channel and I'll see you guys very soon!", "pVXLLYigJHk": "oh hey guys welcome to another video today we are coming at you with another recipe video you guys have been asking me to make a chocolate chip recipe video for quite some time now and I asked you guys I asked you guys I asked you guys on Twitter if you wanted me to make a chocolate chip recipe video and the overwhelming answer was yes so that's what we are here to do today today's recipe isn't actually my personal recipe it's coming from one of my good friend Kathy back at home she's like one of my best friends she has her own website and she's a holistic nutritionist he focuses on like women's health specifically and she has tons of recipes on her website as well and she shared this recipe with me I was like oh my god Betty you need to make these cookies they taste like subway cookies so I'm making her recipe today so all the ingredients and everything is going to be linked to her website in the description down below that was a lot of talking alright so today's cookies are double out today's cookies are double chocolate-chip cookies are you excited yes I'm so pumped he wants cuz they better be good copy they are she said they taste like subway cookies so I believe her she makes really good too so let's get started martini so new cookies are oil free and they're gluten free and they're actually flourless so you don't need any flour for the cookies which I found really cool these are all the ingredients I needs I think there's only like eight ingredients that's bogit first we're gonna mix the dry ingredients so we've got some cocoa powder 2/3 of a cup of cocoa butter we got a cup of coconut sugar cup of chocolate cup of sugar they're real healthy eyes I mean I like the healthiest cookies tester goes through a baking powder and does it blue dragon and in the recipe it says that you can like sift these ingredients so that there is no Kombi clumps but I'm not doing that as you can see oh it's all so disgusting just mix it all together we're going to use this I'm scared of Caroline use well I all over the place we don't have a West guys so because it's handy-dandy victors but it looks dirty or display dirty we're not gonna be done every month so now we're going to wet ingredients you're going to need some almond butter and a cup along you main think this is a cop pulled drawers in here in a couple minutes close enough to an outbreak yeah I'll have to do give every last ass as a jar like a pan or five liter jar this is a 250 grams jar so clearly I didn't measure it properly when I'm fine so this is the only good one that I found at the store we have a cup let's almost pick up salami letter and this is the cool part so this is why you don't need flour because we're using this it looks like urine but it's not hearing it is what they call acqua Pazza so it's the liquid that came out of the chippy pan so I literally just drained the chickpea can into this and this is a liquid that your brain and you can either use it from a can or the liquid if you're cooking chickpeas from like rock you'll need half a cup of this looks delish and vanilla you need about a teaspoon and then you're just going to whisk that together if you have a wish before I'm going to attempt to do this with a fork [Music] the dry ingredients and your wet ingredients and you're just going to add them [Music] so now we're adding in the chocolate chips so I have white chocolate and also dark chocolate begin obviously and Kathy's recipe she only uses like just mini chocolate chips no white chocolate but I thought if we're going to make them look like subway cookies you gotta have the white chocolate in there too so yeah we're not he got some holes of the wall as well so now the batter is all mixed and we're going to put them all in the pan and these cookies spread out like really like thin so you want to only make them like the balls that you're going to put on the thing only like two inches why okay well I'm just going to put these in as a test back because oh how big they're gonna turn out so we're going to put in the Robin I've already preheated the oven to leave 175 degrees selfie selfie selfie Asst or 350 Fahrenheit so we're going to go in for 10 to 11 minutes a few moments later alright so the first batch is done they smell so good look at those don't look good so they just spread out a lot so it's a good thing I always just oh yeah I'm gonna let them cool for a couple minutes and then I'm gonna transfer them to this rack apparently you're supposed to roll them like actually roll them into balls they're all the same size but I didn't do that because I thought it was too thin [Music] in the best part about making cookies especially vegan cookies because there's no raw egg in them you get to eat the batter I think the rest of the spot probably cuz I made another cookie but I'll eat it anyways [Music] so impressed like there's like flattens out yeah like crispy on the outside Wow Oh didn't we find a near addiction mmm let me let me see that you feel a white chocolate huh there we go you like the white chocolate in it well I counted since then doesn't feel like it's overloading me when I take a bite is it chewy in the middle I like crispy on the outside recipe for the hit stop my head off every time sorry haven't tried them yet I'm gonna try them what these are really good [Music] all right so overall this recipe with the success super easy to make like so quick the only thing is I think because we used the water from a can of chickpeas they taste a little bit chickpea which is kind of normal but I think if you were to cook your own chickpeas the chickpeas would only be sitting in that water for like an hour while they cook well if you were to use like the can like we did those chickpeas could have been sitting in the water for like God knows how long like a couple months so I would suggest using the water that you cooked your own chickpeas in rather than a can but they still taste really good even using canned chickpeas and it's a lot easier and quicker to do it that way anyways all right guys I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe video let me know if you try it and also check out Cathy's website where the recipe will be linked down below and give this video a thumbs up if you

my kitchen I have the best recipe that I'm going to show you today it is what we call them cowboy cookies but it's basically an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie and it's the my favorite chocolate chip cookie of all time and I've tried them all trust me I have to give credit to my in-laws for this one because when I first married my husband or first met my husband we went up there and they're like let's make some cowboy cookies in it and I was what what are those anyway but they are good so we'll get started here I have in here one cup of granulated sugar and one cup of brown sugar and then I'm going to add half a cup of shortening no let's see yeah half a cup of shortening and a half a cup of I like salted butter you can use unsalted butter but I like that little bit of extra salt in there I've kind of tweaked this recipe just a little bit to make it my perfect recipe okay and I'm just gonna cream the butter shortening and sugars together and to that once that's nice and combined I have two eggs and a teaspoon of vanilla this batch makes quite a few cookies so you can easily cut this in half I think it makes four dozen four dozen cookies so yeah you could easily have this one and just do two dozen cookies okay I'm going to add my eggs and vanilla that nice and combined okay now I'm going to add two cups of flour one teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and a little more than half a teaspoon of salt like I said I kind of like that extra salty flavor in there so it would be like a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of salt okay I'm gonna get that all mixed in now I am going to add two cups of oats you can either do the instant one minute oats or the whole oats what happen half it doesn't matter I'm just going to do the instant oats today oats today go ahead and add the chocolate chips - I prefer milk get that mixed in okay at this point some optional ingredients that you can add in at this point are I really like the chopped pecans or walnuts you can add dried cranberries you can add raisins you can add I've done white chocolate chips I've done butterscotch chips I've done it all and every variation is really good I'm going to add nuts to this one today but nothing else and one more mix perfect okay this dough is ready I have a baking sheet language parchment paper you can use cooking spray that will work too I have a miniature size ice cream scoop and I just will do a nice big scoop of dough you can also just scoop the spoon amout bike with a couple spoons that totally works and these will go in the oven at 350 degrees for about eight to ten minutes you'll know they're done when the into the middle of the cookie is just barely barely cooked and the outsides are just barely turning brown the cookies will continue to cook on the sheet for another minute or two so if they look slightly underdone that's okay that's the time to take them out okay then I'll just kind of shape them so they're nice and round make sure to wash your hands after handling the cookie dough and these are ready to go in the oven okay I have my cookies out of the oven and I let them cool on the pan for about 10 minutes if you can wait that long but my kids I'm

playlist playlist right up here so make sure you going to check this out but today I I don't care that it's January and we're all doing healthy eating I want to treat and I want it really really quickly so no one else notices that I've had it that's the sort of treat I'm talking about and we're going to do a cookie in the microwave in under one minute so one minute microwave chocolate chip cookie how does that sound should we get going let's do this disclaimer one minute less than one minute cooking time and make taking more time to measure out the ingredients okay go in okay so first things first you're gonna put a tablespoon of butter into a microwavable cup and that's gonna go into our microwave for about 10 seconds just to melt you don't want to see your butter boiling just melt it thank you very much so it should only need about 10 second blasts I've got a very cheap microwave very helpful if you have a digital microwave otherwise I'm gonna do a lot less by eye so bear with me great yeah okay so our butter is melted it has not boiled at any point though just just melted that perfect to that we're going to add one tablespoon of dark brown sugar oh my goodness we're then going to add one tablespoon of granulated sugar that's important between what the course texture in our cookie we're then going to add in a pinch of salt and we're also going to add in some vanilla extract now if you've got vanilla extract just as a teaspoon I've got Papa vanilla paste here so I'm going to add in half a teaspoon all the good stuff oh it's so cute I'm gonna give that a really good stir to make sure all of your sugar and your butter is combined to that we're going to add one egg yolk a bowl so just the yolk of our egg this time it's gonna let the white run out you can always save this and make something or if you are being healthy this January make this helper egg white omelet so in with the egg yolk and you give that a good mix up lovely so we should have a nice well mixed but still quite runny mixture at this point we're now going to go in with a thickener which is our plain flour and I've got three tablespoons of plain flour going into this and we're going to stir that most of the way through and just before we finish we're going to add in our chocolate chips we just don't want to over stare our chocolate chips because otherwise we could start melting them and I want a nice solid chocolate chip in my chocolate chip Omega and give that a final stir as well so what you are left with now is essentially a cookie dough mixture this is gonna go into our microwave on its highest setting for 40 to 60 seconds I recommend taking out about 40 checking it what you're looking for is a nice cone cooking but it shouldn't be tacky on top [Music] I might actually have to eat raw cookie dough our game of that it's perfectly fine oh that should be 40 seconds I'd say it should be firm at this point but Tachyon tada yeah it's a cookie in a cup now just picture this just gotta have them work it's been dark when you left for work it's dark when you get in from work you just want a little bit of comforts and just to make your heart happy you know

[Music] you", "2xEwdi7zs4o": "This cookie of the month is an all-time classic that I think every American loves to have to in their home. There are so many debates on what makes the perfect chocolate chip cookie and while I'm not gonna claim to have\nthe ultimate and best one out there, I think it comes pretty close. This is also\na basic that I think everyone wants to have in their\nkitchen: a go-to recipe that all kids will love and that you always can make on a whim or when you are having people over. It's just the perfect cookie. To start, you want to cream together some butter and some vegetable shortening. Chocolate chip cookies can be completely different whether they have vegetable shortening or butter and I think a little bit of a mix of the two really makes a great cookie. Cream it together until it's incorporated and then add some brown sugar and some white sugar. I love the addition of both of these sugars. It adds some deeper flavor with  the brown and a little bit lighter texture with\nthe white. Next, you want to add your eggs and a little bit of hot water. I know it\nsounds weird but it loosens up the batter just enough to give them a great texture. Of course you need to add some vanilla for flavoring, and then flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Both of these do different things in the cookie and together, they make the perfect cookie -  a brown crusty cookie with a soft and chewy interior. To finish these off, you just want to add in your semi-sweet chocolate chips. I think semi-sweet are the way to go with chocolate chip cookies. They're not too sweet like milk chocolate would be and they're not too bitter like a bittersweet would be. They're just the perfect amount of sweetness and good chocolate flavor. And of course, the better chocolate chips you use, the better you will really have in the end with your cookie. Using a cookie scoop is really the easiest way to make these. Just scoop them out onto a pan and then bake them in a preheated oven for about 10 to 12 minutes. I usually find that 11 minutes is perfect in my oven, but every oven is different and so you want to wait until the outside edges are slightly golden and the center is still soft and light in color. Let them cool on the pan for about five minutes and then remove them and let them cool on the rack until they're fully cool. Of course, they're best enjoyed when they're just a little bit warm but these freeze beautifully and can last for ages in the freezer and you can pull them out when your kids come home from school or when you're having people over. They really are my go-to basic cookie. I think with this recipe, you will have one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes in your repertoire.

I can't wait to see you guys again!", "AWdUZ0rruFU": "so today we show you how to make me and my sister's delicious secret soft chocolate chip cookie recipe it's a pretty old recipe we've had it for maybe even ten years or longer and if you guys don't believe me I can show you this is my first ever cookbook that I kind of started reading down my own recipes and variations of recipes and things like that and as you can see it's been through a lot I kind of left it on the stove at one point which is really dangerous don't ever do that but somewhere in here right here right on the bottom there's soft chocolate chip cookies that's the recipe that me my sister made together okay my sister wheels always used to love eating chocolate chip cookies and we couldn't find a recipe for a good soft chocolate chip cookie so we kind of started experimenting and tweaking until we kind of made one that we really really loved so that's what I'm going to show you guys today okay so first you want to start off with half a cup of room temperature unsalted butter or margarine and six tablespoons of organic white sugar and brown sugar 16 spoons of each and then you want to go ahead and creep those together okay so once you've got this room together you go ahead and add your egg and mix that together here we go then we just add all of our remaining ingredients which would be 1 cup and 1/8 of light milk flour and half a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 a teaspoon of sea salt and as well half a teaspoon of vanilla and this is not artificial vanilla I would never recommend using that so this is actually one that I got when I was Mexico so yeah just have a teaspoon of vanilla let me go ahead and mix that and before the dough is fully mixed together I like to add my chocolate chips so I like to just do a handful of tricks but I have really small hands so it's about quarter of a cup and just mix that together [Music] there you go and that's your chocolate-chip cookie batter so now that that's done you just want to go ahead and put the dough into the pan so you can drop them onto in greased pan or onto parchment paper and it does about 24 cookies so that's what you can go ahead and do now so I have with guns already and I've done a purchase on both of them except one of them I've done have so you can see how the cookies turn out on a greased pan and parchment so let's go ahead and grab some of the dough and you can just drop them onto the sheet like that there we go so after we've done that go ahead and wash your hands with some soap and water [Music] and I like to roll my cookies into little balls so this way every single time will turn out into a perfect round shape not everybody likes that some people kind of like that rustic look of just having it into you know whatever shape and I kind of like good-looking you know perfect transcript and like a little bit even on your parent like a little bit evenly spaced out so that they hopefully don't really touch each other when they kind of flatten out okay very good so after you roll them all into balls I like to flatten them out a little bit and it lessens your cooking time as well [Music] there you go and now put them into a preheated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit into the middle rack for 10 minutes and if you if both ends don't fit in the middle rack like mine and you can definitely go ahead and put one in the middle and then one at the bottom and then switch them halfway it doesn't really turn out as nice that way but what can you do now we wait so I just took the cookies out of the oven they've been cooling for a little bit and they look like this and the cool thing about them having them on the parchment paper is that they come off so easily just like that so and on the greased side they come off pretty much just as easily just like that should be Charlie even though 21 2014 most of you my super-healthy here I'm doing this for you guys let's try one come on if you guys don't like these cookies like seriously send them over here they're so good oh my god but honestly they taste just as good as they used to make them we're younger and they are so good they they honestly taste like subway cookies they're so good so I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe and like and comment thank you for watching have a great day god damnit Oh [Music]", "Fh7acREmkGs": "[Music] legend has it that chocolate-chip cookies were invented in 1930 by an American innkeeper who ran out of baker's chocolate she improvised by breaking a semi-sweet chocolate bar into small pieces instead of melting the chocolate merely softened dotting the cookie with chocolate chips they look homemade and they taste homemade but this ho is a factory each ingredient goes into an industrial-sized mixer starting with white sugar then brown sugar then butter [Music] the mixer thoroughly blends these first ingredients until the butter becomes soft and creamy and the sugars are evenly dispersed then it's time for the headliner chocolate chips they're semi-sweet which is a mixture of bitter and sweet chocolate next flour followed by baking soda to make the dough rise and salt to add flavor the final ingredients are whole eggs beaten combined with vanilla made from beans harvested in Madagascar Africa mixing resumes until everything is well blended which usually takes about five minutes the company closely guards recipe specifics but if you're curious you could probably figure them out by multiplying the ingredients of a home recipe to the yield of a production batch workers transfer the cookie dough to a machine called the former it pushes the dough through round eyes producing row upon row of round pieces weighing 1.4 ounces each one of several sizes the factory produces the factory then flash freezes the dough rounds for sale to foodservice customers such as restaurants and hotels which bake the cookies in their own kitchens the freeze tunnel uses liquid nitrogen to create the frigid temperature the passing dough rounds solidify in approximately 5 minutes exiting the freeze tunnel the dough rounds pass under a metal detector to ensure they don't contain any metal particles this safety measure is standard practice in the food industry the packaging system is entirely automated the first station erect the box the second station lines it with plastic a conveyor belt meanwhile feeds the frozen unbaked cookies onto automated scales once the scale hits the per box weight feeding pauses the bottom swings open and the cookies drop into the box awaiting directly underneath the next stations seal and label the boxes which workers then load onto pallets the pallets go into a storage freezer where they stay until it's time to ship them out by freezer truck to the customer this company also sells gift tens of cookies online and by catalog for that market they bake the cookies in-house workers lay out the dough rounds two inches apart on trays lined with parchment paper this prevents sticking making it easy to remove the bake cookies without breaking them the dough rounds are nearly one and a half inches wide by one inch high as they bake they flatten out and double in diameter the trays remain in the oven for seven minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit a turntable inside rotates them so that the cookies bake evenly throughout the tray a few cookies per batch go to the quality control tester who unfortunately doesn't get to conduct the assessment by eating the samples rather the tester measures the diameter and height to ensure consistency in size and chip content in the online and catalog order assembly area workers line the bottom part of the gift tin with the decorative cellophane bag then they carefully layer the correct number of fresh cookies inside in a staggered configuration this not only creates a nice presentation it also prevents damage in transit they close the bag with a gold twist tie to seal in the freshness close up the tin then pack it for shipping this is how to give a gift of homemade chocolate chip cookies without ever setting foot in the kitchen", "F3p0VpdAgeA": "well comes when lassen

you how to make white chocolate cherry shortbread cookies go start by drying off some cherries and then I'm going to quarter them and when I have them all finely chopped up I'm going to place them back on a paper towel to dry them off a little bit more and then we're going to take a white chocolate baking bar and I'm going to finely chop it and then in a large bowl I'm going to stir together some flour and some sugar and don't worry I'll all the exact measurements below in the description box next I'm going to add in my butter and using a pastry blender I'm going to start working that into the flour and you're going to do this until it resembles fine crumbs then I'm going to add in my white chocolate the cherries almond extract and a couple drops of red food coloring and then you're going to mix that together and eventually you're going to want to start kneading the dough so I went ahead and put on some gloves just to try to avoid getting food coloring on my hands and you're gonna want to knead it together for a little bit until you can form it into a ball and then I'm going to break off some pieces of the dough and roll it together place them on a cookie sheet and then I have a glass dipped in sugar that I'm going to use to press down the cookies then I'm gonna preheat my oven to 325 degrees and cook them for about 10 to 12 minutes and when they come out they will look like this and I let them cool for a few minutes while I was making the white chocolate to dip them in so I'm adding some white chocolate with a little bit of shortening and I'm going to microwave this for about 30 second increments taking it out and storing it in between until it is fully melted and when it's ready it will be nice and smooth like this so then all that is left to do is dip half of your cookie in the white chocolate and then set it on some wax paper you can also drizzle the chocolate on top if you'd like or even add a little sprinkles on top of the chocolate so the cookies should set up pretty quickly you can also put them in the fridge to make the chocolate set up quicker but once the chocolate is set they are ready to eat and these are hands-down one of my favorite kind of cookies they're absolutely delicious so I hope you give this recipe a try and thank you so much for watching bye guys", "bbjvpOl_1wQ": "hello everyone and welcome back to the rich lai today I have a guest chef again in the house Riley do you want to say hello to everybody and we are making cookies for Santa white chocolate macadamia cookies which I have been making forever giving away his gifts over Christmas but this year we're giving them to Santa right yeah and oh I almost forgot we have a special guest gabriella who's joining us as you can see we're all rocking and matching aprons American Girl style from williams-sonoma so we are super excited to make these cookies for Santa we're gonna use flour I use unbleached flour it's a personal preference of mine we're using light brown sugar regular white sugar butter lots of butter we love butter right eggs a little bit of baking soda a little bit of salt of course the macadamia nuts in white chocolate morsels so Riley the first step we need to do to make our cookies is mix the flour with our baking soda okay healy that's it yep I'm gonna add this dad oh you want to do it I'm sorry all right here you hold this

combined together no not yet okay so Riley are you ready to combine the sugar and/or the sugars and the butter and mommy will do the vanilla yeah I should say I'm not really a baker I love being in the kitchen I love cooking but I'm not a bigger so hopefully Riley will take over baking in the house yes he'll bake everything so mommy won't have to make things that we don't like yeah okay do you like cookies we do like cookies I do bake cookies I do bake cookies very well but that's about it [Music] [Music] so now that we've established that Riley is the head Baker in the house she has the job of cracking the eggs so I'm praying this will go well I think it'll go well okay all right crack an egg let me see I'll take the shelves today she's gonna be my helpful today foolin I cook yes I

firm enough for us to start putting it on our cookie sheet so what we have here are just two tablespoons one for me one for Riley oops and we're just gonna drop some dough here about maybe two inches or so apart on our cookie sheet uh-oh so everyone has their mitts on Gabriella's got hers Robbie has hers Mommy has hers had five and we are going to put our cookies in a preheated oven 375 and we're

"CFoYQTKz4_c": "[Music] hi guys I'm Tamera the food director at Woolworths fresh magazine and today I'm going to give you my secret recipe to make the best chocolate chip out coqu\u00ed's they're soft they're chewy they're full of chocolate chips and I'm gonna give you heaps of tips along the way watch along and let's get started alright so clean hands I'm gonna run you through the ingredients that you're gonna need we've got one and a half cups of plain flour one cup of rolled oats you're gonna need a teaspoon of bicarb soda three quarters of a cup of firmly packed brown sugar some flakes salt a teaspoon of vanilla 1/3 of a cup of castor sugar and most importantly dark chocolate dark chocolates the best in this alright so I brought in my mixer because normally it's hiding away in the corner first step is pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees fan-forced and our first step here with the mixer is gonna be creaming our butter and sugar together so I've got unsalted butter here it's at room temperature so if I push it it makes a dent in there but it's not too soft that it's starting to melt and I've got a paddle attachment for my mixer so if you don't have a stand mixer you can just use a handheld feeder that's totally fine alright so butter into the mix up we're gonna start off at a slow speed and slowly increase to medium speed all right so it's looking really good and this step takes about order I don't know if you can hear me um this step takes about two to three minutes and if you don't notice it getting stuck on the sides of the mixer you can just stop it at any point and just give it a scrape down with the spatula just pop that back on and it's just gonna take about another minute but you can already see it's getting nice and pale and fluffy the hardest part is always waiting for the cookies that's the hardest part okay so the butter looks beautiful pale fluffy so it's time to talk about sugar so we're using two types of sugar this is pretty cool this is a really good tip for making cookies so dark brown sugar has a little bit of molasses in it gives it that darker color but most importantly a beautiful caramel flavor and it's also gonna make your cookies really soft and chewy and then caster sugar just make sure that you know we still have some structure to our cookie and that it's a little bit crisp on top and then just put the mixer back on and it's gonna take about a minute to combine butter sugar done you can see it's that beautiful consistent color and texture it's nice and fluffy and creamy so it's time to add the egg so just cracking in one egg and also adding in the vanilla at this stage too we've mixed a lot already and that was to get some you know air into that butter mixture but now it's about mixing as little as possible because we don't want tough cookies so this is just gonna take about a minute just until it's incorporated it's looking beautiful thick creamy still fluffy now it's time to add the dry ingredients I'm using rolled oats along with that plain flour it just gives the cookies a really nice interesting texture flour also a teaspoon of bicarb soda in this just gives your cookies a little bit a lift a little bit of rides in the oven make sure they're not flat and dense and salt is really important too just a pinch will season the cookies and as weird as that sound it is important to see them sweet as well as savory this sounds like the soundtrack to my life just positive mixer in the background so you can hear the sound of the mixture changing a little bit that's my sign that this is ready okay really important not to over mix so I think we're done we're good so it's time to chop the chocolate at this point you can use other mix-ins as well like cranberries or sultanas but I have no idea why you would because chocolate is obviously the best so let's get chopping I'm using a block of dark chocolate because I find this is better than using chocolate chips when you roughly chop this it means that you can get some really big chunks which are going to be beautiful pools of chocolate in the cookies and also some little bits as well which are going to be flecked throughout so this gives you the ultimate cookie in my opinion okay time to add in the chocolate there's no like I feel like there's no neat way to do that okay so really really low speed it's just to incorporate the chocolate now just cover this and put it in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes it means that some of that moisture is gonna be absorbed through the cookie dough it's gonna give us a better texture cookie it's not gonna spread so much in the oven and then we'll be back to bake them this is actually another little tip this is actually an ice cream scoop but it is perfect for scooping cookie dough so all you're gonna do is just scoop that cookie dough roll it into a ball just to smooth that surface look at that big chunk of chocolate in there that's gonna be delicious when we bake this so just flatten it down just a little bit working with chilled is actually really good because the heat of your hands can melt the butter but because we've chilled it first not a problem so we also want to just allow for some spreading of the cookies in the oven so don't place them too close together alright so first tray is done I'm gonna put them into the oven while I roll the rest this is gonna take about nine or ten minutes you want to make sure there's still a little bit under baked so they're beautiful soft and chewy when they come out so at this stage you can freeze them as these shaped cookies put them into a little ziplock bag and then you've got cookies on demand whenever you want them just pop them into the oven and they'll take about two or three extra minutes on top of that normal cookie time cookies are ready okay so bring them out of the oven they're gonna look like they're still a little bit under baked at this stage but that is actually perfect that means they cook perfectly they will harden as they cool I'm gonna while they're hot just sprinkle them with a little extra flake salt oh my gosh guys I have never been so excited for something to come out of the oven I can tell you this is the best chocolate chip or cookie you will try they've just cooled down but still warm enough that they're beautiful and gooey inside check this out young for more great recipe inspiration check out your latest copy of Woolworths fresh magazine [Music]", "dZhk9pEUINs": "this podcast is produced by the Harwood productions podcast network to learn more about the network and to find more of our shows visit us online at wwe.com have you ever felt disappointed by white chocolate I know I have a lot of times it doesn't have much flavor but I found a really good white chocolate and so I decided to make these white chocolate macadamia nut cookies so the first thing we're gonna do is get our dry ingredients together so I'm gonna get about 2 and a quarter cups of flour and put it in my bowl and then I'm gonna start adding some of the leavening to it and I'm going to be adding a half a teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and then I'm just gonna whisk that together and set it aside now to continue to boost the flavor of this cookie I'm gonna use two kinds of sugar so I'm gonna get a cup of brown sugar and then a half a cup of white sugar and I'm gonna put that in my mixing bowl and then I want to turn the machine on just for a minute or so because I really want those sugars to get nice and blended and then I'm going to be adding 3/4 of a cup of a softened butter and that's a stick and a half and I'm going to add that to the sugars and put that on low speed and start to make sort of a thick paste with the butter and the sugars then it's time to get out the eggs and I'm gonna go ahead and crack two eggs into a small bowl and then in that same small bowl I'm going to add two teaspoons of vanilla now the butter is nicely mixed in I'm gonna go ahead and start adding the eggs and the vanilla and I'm just gonna put in one egg at a time let it kind of mix around a little bit and then add the second egg now here is the chocolate it's a Lindt chocolate and you can get it many of the grocery stores and you need two bars of the white chocolate now this chocolate was quite a surprise to me I had heard about it from a professional pastry chef that this is all they used and when I unwrapped it I was really surprised as I started to cut the chocolate up because I need to get it into smaller pieces it's very creamy and soft normally when you cut chocolate up it flies everywhere but not this chocolate it is a very moist and delicious white chocolate so what you want to do is just start cutting those two bars up into little chunks now once you get the chocolate all chopped we're going to be using some macadamia nuts and I like them to be unsalted if you can find them and we're going to need about a cup of these chopped these are a very big nut so I don't want them finely chopped I want them to show up in the cookie but I just kind of want to cut them about in half and again we need to get about a cup of them together now go slowly with this nut because your knife can kind of roll off them but once you get your cup we're gonna go back to the mixer and we're gonna turn it off and then we are gonna add all of the rest of these ingredients at once now I notice that I had still some butter on my paddle here so I did want to go ahead and scrape that down and kind of get that mixed back in but again stop the mixer put in all the flour put in the cup of macadamia nuts and put in the two bars of chopped white chocolate now it's really important that we don't overmix this cookie because the white chocolate is soft so I'm just gonna put this on low speed and you'll see maybe five or six seconds no more once it starts to come together I turn the Machine off grab my spatula and give it a final mix down now one of the things with this cookie is you can actually put some saran over it and put it in the refrigerator and bake them off later which is what I ended up having to do and so then I just pulled them out of the refrigerator got my parchment lined baking sheet and my little cookie scoop and I just went ahead and started filling up my pan and then I'm gonna bake these in a 350 degree oven for just nine minutes it doesn't take long I just want the edges to start to brown and then get them off that cookie sheet so they can start to cool you know these are kind of a subtle flavor cookie with the white chocolate and the macadamia nut that brown sugar adds a little bit of a caramel type flavor to it but I'll tell you you've got to use that Lindt white chocolate it is definitely the best now as always if you'd like to give these cookies a try go to our website and I've got the recipe there for you well I hope you enjoy him and I'll see you next time", "HUSR3-C501o": "bursting with that chocolate and lots of nuts chocolate chip cookies are always a favorite these are really easy as they are made with melted butter so it's a good choice of a recipe for a beginner to try you can find various recipes and various versions for making this chocolate chip cookies and they could be made with the butter and the sugar cream together or with melted key just with brown sugar or a mixture of brown sugar and white sugar and so on and so forth I came across this really easy recipe for chocolate chip cookies and Alice metrics book this is a really good book you must own this recipe doesn't need much by way of technique you just mix together all the ingredients you chill the dough and then Bing the cookies and so these are the ingredients you can also find the ingredient list in the description below the video we have some soft unsalted butter some brown sugar please use good-quality brown sugar for good taste and there's some castor sugar here could also use just white sugar but the taste of the cookies will be slightly different and then we have some flour sifted together with some baking soda and a pinch of salt and then we have some egg here and we have some vanilla here and for the students you could use toasted walnuts and some dark chocolate chopped up or even chocolate chips if you have some good quality ones you could also use butterscotch chips and pecans or even white chocolate and pistachios anything you please so we'll melt the butter this heavy saucepan here and when the bottle is still warm we add the sugar both the white and the brown sugar the sturgeon and then we add in the egg and the vanilla and then the flour mixture will just stir it in very gently we need to stir till just all the dry ingredients are moistened we cannot want to over mix this and then we add the nuts and the chocolate and then mix this gently again so this is your cookie dough it's ready and then we wrap this dough with cling film and then refrigerate it you will need to refrigerate this dough for at least 1 to 2 hours overnight is even better or say Silas Madrid the dough will be quite soft now and it will firm up once it is refrigerated the dough will be quite firm after you refrigerate and you will need to keep this on the counter for about 10 to 15 minutes if you need to soften it a little so that it becomes a little more malleable then you would be able to scoop it out easily and then put it on the tray and this is the sheet for making the cookies I have lined this with aluminum foil with the dull side facing up you don't need to grease the aluminum foil and if you would be using a cookie sheet of a really good quality you don't even need to use the remm foil and if you grease the tray when the recipe direct you not to your cookies will spread too much so do not do that and so now we'll scoop out the dough using a tablespoon will take rounded tablespoons of this dough and then drop it on the baking sheet and we need to space the cookies well apart so that they have the space to spread and we'll flatten them a little bit just a tiny bit and now I have this oven preheated to 190 degrees centigrade and we are going to be making these cookies for about ten to eleven minutes so once we keep these cookies for baking we'll start preparing for the next batch we need to make the cookies for about ten to eleven minutes till they start darkening around the edges the tops will no longer be wet and when you touch it with your finger tip it will still feel soft the baking time may vary depending on your oven the cookies will firm up as they cool if in doubt bake the cookies less than for more time because the cookies will harden as they cool and if needed you could always put the cookies back into the oven for a minute more if you think they need to bake a little more if making the cookies in an oven toaster griller you would have to rotate the trays halfway in between it's always a good idea to make a small test batch of cookies to see how long they will take to bake and how you would like them cool the cookies completely taste them see the texture and then make the rest of the cookies accordingly so after about ten minutes the cookies are baked and I am going to be taking them out from the oven and then immediately lift the foil and then put it on the cooling rack if you leave the cookies on the hot baking sheet they'll continue to cook and harden further so we do not want that let them be there for a couple of minutes and then remove them onto the cooling rack to cool completely these cookies taste best when they're eaten slightly warm please do try these cookies and let me know how you like them lots more recipes and lots of tips coming up on cakes and more please subscribe please stay tuned", "dkDbLsN72Jg": "now I'm going to share with you my four tips to make be perfect chocolate-chip cookie like this one mark our target whether it's cakey chewy crunchy whatever consistency you prefer these are the four techniques that will take you to chocolate chip cookie heaven first off zum sugars are always better than one you want to start off with some granulated sugar granulated sugar will make it extra crunchy we're light brown sugar lightly packed we'll give it that nice chewy consistency the sweet cookie then you're gonna mix it up and your sugars are done second tip it's all about the butter and how you cream it you want to start off with room-temperature butter this will help make everything combined I also start with unsalted butter because I could control the salt turn that on to high it will be lighter in color and it will give you the consistency of mayonnaise after it gets nice and creamy you're going to add your sugar it's gonna increase in volume it's gonna get super fluffy and don't worry you can't over beat it just let it go if you don't have a stand mixer you can also do this with a hand mixer but I definitely won't do with this with a whisk just go buy your cookie now let's talk about tip number three it's all about the eggs remember to take good care of them oftentimes people do forget to take them out so they get to room temp we can do is take a bowl fill it with warm tap water and you can let it sit there for five to seven minutes to take the chill off and it's nice and warm inside crack the egg and add it in and keep in mind it will look curdle that's totally normal at the second egg and make sure you don't have any shells because you don't want that extra crunch add a little vanilla for flavoring pure vanilla extract is best all the wet ingredients are ready and let's talk about tip number four which is all about the dry when you're measuring flour make sure you don't go like this that's not measuring flour what happens is you get these huge air pockets and you're not actually getting in the right amount of flour the correct way is to take a spoon and spoon it in and never pack flour it's nice and airy shake off a little take a butter knife and scrape it off now that there's a third cup of flour the right way that it continued great flour check and every good baked item has a little hint of salt then you're gonna add some baking soda or whatever leavening and before you add it into your mixing bowl you want to give this a quick whisk everything should be incorporated before adding joining the party then they could be one big party another great tip is I like to take a spoon or you could pour this on parchment and you can scoop it in so it doesn't get everywhere also add your flour in batches go slow no flour facial once that's incorporated you can start adding smaller batches I usually like to give the bowl and I scrape down after the second batch now with the right hand you can just dump it in to make sure you scrape it off the paddle unlove you don't want to over mix it just until everything's all in a good harmony perfect and now my favorite part chocolate chips I like to do the very last step by hand should ensure that I don't over mix you can use semi-sweet chocolate you can use bittersweet you can even use milk chocolate but please don't use white chocolate now that it's all mixed you can scoop them out on a baking sheet and you can pop them in the freezer and when they get become little frozen balls you can take all of them pop in on a zip top bag and you can make them whenever you want whether it's a long day or you want a last-minute dessert and don't eat raw jar it's not the best for you all right well I'm gonna pop this in the freezer the meantime I'm gonna eat this cookie [Music] you", "3ZsSiogCu6s": "we're adam and joanne from inspiredtaste.net and fifty degree oven add two and a quarter sticks of room-temperature butter and equal parts of granulated sugar and brown sugar to a large bowl then use a hand mixer on medium speed to be everything until creamy light and fluffy this will take about two minutes scrape the sides of the bowl then add one egg turn the mixer to medium and beat until well incorporated add a second egg as well as vanilla extract then beat until they are well mixed it's a good idea to scrape the sides occasionally while mixing grab a second Bowl and add one and a half cups of all-purpose flour 3/4 cups of cocoa powder a little baking soda and then some salt whisk six to ten times to make sure everything is mixed well with the hand mixer on low slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed we add it in three parts the cookie batter will become very thick our mix are actually strains level at the end don't worry though you only need to mix until everything has combined grab a large knife and chop 12 ounces of chocolate into small chunks we use milk chocolate but white semi-sweet or dark chocolate works well to add the chocolate to the batter and use a spoon or spatula to stir it in drop cookie dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto baking sheets a medium cookie scoop is helpful here then bake 9 to 12 minutes or until the cookies have puffed and the tops are dry let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely [Music] for

this is so simple and easy to do and Aniyah was my assistant and yeah let's just get straight into it I'm just gonna go through the grounds and I will list everything in the description box below so you guys can go back to it and ya find the ingredients and the measurements okay so we have 115 grams of unsalted butter room temperature then we have 225 grams of golden caster sugar we have 300 grams of plain flour you can even use all-purpose flour then you have two eggs which are at room temperature and then we have two packets of chocolate chunks which you can buy from anyway one teaspoon of baking powder and we're gonna use one teaspoon of vanilla extract or vanilla flavoring so yeah that is all the ingredients and then now me and I are gonna get into action ready and I are yes okay now it's gonna grab the butter and we're also gonna take the sugar together and we're gonna whisk these two together so in our please put the sugar into the bowl the sugar yep and then you want to add the butter and by the way what did we do before we started baking we washed our hands thoroughly so make sure you guys are always being clean yeah we also tied our hair back and yeah hygiene is very very important especially in this time and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the whisk and and I'm gonna whisk this all together because it's not safe but in order to use the whisk so I'm gonna whisk the butter and the sugar together now that as you guys can see the butter and the sugar has become very very fluffy and it's so nice it smells really nice as well so yeah when I get it to this consistency like a nice fluffy mixture okay so now we're gonna add the room-temperature eggs and you need to add two so I'm just gonna break it yeah one [Music] after that we're just gonna add one teaspoon of vanilla extract or vanilla flavoring whatever you guys want to call it there you go then we're gonna mix all of that up together so how many is mobile ten spoon for this use my spatula okay so now we're gonna take the flour and we're gonna sift the flour into the mixture you can also do this in a separate bowl but this is just quicker this way and then what I'm doing I'm not adding it all together I'm literally just dreamy a little bit at a time wooden spoon just fold the mixture in and by folding I mean like this so you guys can see if come together like a doll and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use my hands which have been washed I'm gonna bring the dog together I'm gonna need the doll together and I'm gonna bring the dough together so you know it's gonna take part and do this as well so now you wanna swap how does it feel when I on you feels really good it's like you're like it's like a marshmallow softer yeah yeah so you need to help you need to pull it together more so grab it like this yeah hold the bowl for her so make it all stick together grab all the flour together I'm gonna add the chocolate chunks into the mixture so the mixture should look something like this it's such a nice dough I don't give me no all of them and then now you can put your fingers in there and stop like on the dole make sure the whole chocolate is inside the dial up that's it girl it's a real workout in our case you might need adult supervision for this if you liked it and yeah yeah like me cuz obviously you need the adults to put sides you guys can see the dough is coming together and sticking to the doll nicely so everything needs to stick to the dough if it doesn't if it's not sticky enough then it won't stick to the dough this is a real workout guys keep kneading keep pushing those chocolate chunks in put your full force in perfect looks really nice all sticking together so now that the mixture has become like this it's perfectly done we'll do the chunks at in so basically here is my team we're making a mess of cookie dough and I'm just adding more chocolate chunks on the cookies and then this is gonna spread nicely and you're going to govern you ready for this and also one tip guys just make you a little bit smaller when you pull out the dough who's the hoods gonna spread cause this is the cookie dough looks like guys II this is what a cookie dog is looking like right now I'm just gonna add some ice cream in the middle and then I'll obviously got some melted chocolate in here which I'll sprinkle all over the cookie dough and I also baked some more cookies and these are stacks of cookies and that's also gonna have ice cream on top Shanice just took a bit of ice cream on top and now we're just gonna get the Nutella so there you have it guys homemade cookie doll with the scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle and then you just eat that data [Music]", "EBswQNthk8Y": "hi guys welcome back to my channel today I'm coming at you with another brand new recipe this time for my white chocolate chunk cookies now these are like brand new I haven't put these on the book yet so I'll put the full recipe in the description down below but I wanted to show you how easy these are to make they taste insane and they're like kind of crunchy and chewy and soft and amazing and I can't wait you to make them so I thought I'd show you how many do they are to make now if you want to make just a normal chocolate chip cookie recipe you can simply just substitute the cocoa powder for more gluten free flour the same amount and you can use any chocolate you like but I think the white chocolate works really well with the kind of chocolatey cookie so have a look at how you make them and I really hope that you'll give them a go because they are so easy and so worth it so I'm gonna show you how to make these Molly the rest is good hmm the first thing you need to do to make these cookies is to melt some butter now you don't want this to be bubbling hot you just want it to be melted enough this liquid and then you're gonna add in your caster sugar and beat it together with an electric whisk just so it kind of combines like this just only for a minute or so and once you've done that we're going to add in an egg and again we're gonna beat this with the electric way spray for about 30 seconds until it forms this kind of or any butter now the next step is to mix together our flour or baking powder and a cocoa powder I just like to mix this together before I add it to the mix just so you don't get lumps of flour or kind of on their own and once you've mixed that together we're gonna sift it in I don't normally use a sieve for my recipes but I do think it helps with this because again it's actually getting any lumps all hard lumps of cocoa powder now give this a bit of a mix round and as you can see the mixture starts to come together this is about the time we add in our chocolate you can use white chocolate chips for this but I like to use a bar of white chocolate which I chopped up into chunks because that way you can make the chunks as big or as little as you like but I think is better with big chunks of white chocolate in so then you're going to add this to your mixture and you're gonna use a wooden spoon to bring it all together and you can see it's gonna get nice and thick so as it starts to thicken you may need to use your hands of it for this but the mix you're still going to be quite soft so the really important stage ernest is to chill it in the fridge for about an hour and to do that I'm just gonna flatten out and wrap it in some cling film pop that in the fridge for an hour and then when it's done you'll see it's a lot easier to kind of mold the cookies aren't too soft so I'm gonna mold these into some golf balls shaped balls and space them out just in case they spread because as you can see from this lovely time-lapse that I made in my clean oven you can actually see the Coe he spread a bit but not too much so they have this lovely crackle on top and inside they're all soft and if you eat them when they're warm the top is getting nice and gooey too they have it guys that's hard to make my white chocolate chunk cookies I really hope you enjoyed this recipe video I hope you found it helpful and you're gonna try it yourself if you do please let me know in the

chocolate-chip cookies and if you didn't want to make this double chocolate chip you can make this the regular chocolate chip cookies but instead of using cocoa powder you would use boot all of this would be white flour so for this I have here all-purpose flour some cocoa powder some melted butter brown sugar chocolate chip and I'm using milk chocolate chip and am using Nestle's tool-house so these are the chips that are musing you can use any type of chocolate chips you prefer and I'm using the same Nestle Tollhouse at four white-armed chocolate chips I prefer these they're really really nice also have one egg some vanilla essence or extract I have a pinch of salt some baking soda and some instant Nescafe you can use any type of instant coffee that you want or you can omit the coffee it's optional I just find that the coffee gives the chocolates are really nice flavor I tried this recipe using baking powder and I prefer it I prefer using baking soda over baking powder but if you wanted to use baking powder then by all means you can the type of cocoa powder I'm using and since the who is she's brown the sorry so just in case you wanna know which one I use so now let's get started I'm putting this together so the first thing I did was I put my oven to preheat at 350 degrees Fahrenheit next we're gonna put all of our dry ingredients into one bowl sort of flour the cocoa powder and I'm using unjust unsweetened cocoa powder for this the baking soda the Nescafe or instant coffee the salt you just want to mix these eat ingredients into combine and once you've mixed them and just set this dry mixture aside to another bowl you're gonna add in your sugar and your softened butter mine's just got a little too soft but that's okay we're gonna whisk this the cream put ingredients together okay next you're gonna add in your one egg and the vanilla and you're gonna make this to combine okay now we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I'm also gonna put in my chocolate chips at the same time both white and milk chocolate and I'm gonna mix to combine and you don't want to over mix this remember we want a nice soft gooey chocolate chip we see how that's coming together it's gonna create it's gonna make a firm dough so once everything comes together let's get our cookie sheet ready okay for this I'm using my silicone baking mat if you don't have one of this you can use parchment paper or you can just grease your cookie tree I'm also gonna be using an ice cream scoop this is about 1 and 1/2 inches and I'm just gonna use this I can get exact or even arm cookies I'm gonna scoop out please into my hand and I'm gonna place it on the silicon Maxim and I'm just gonna continue making all the rest of the cookies and I'll see you guys back in a little okay so the cookies just came out of the oven I'm gonna leave them to cool a little bit if you want you can transfer them to a wire rack once they cool I'll show you guys what it look like on the inside I just want to go in and break one so you guys can see you see how soft it's so so so soft on the inside it's like chewy if you've ever had subway cookies it's like chewy like that so guys here you have it my double chocolate chip cookies guys this is so delicious and it's so gooey and gooey in the center and it still has a nice crunchy exterior no I noticed when I was baking this set it was taking very long to open out and FLAC notes I just went in with a fork and I just pressed it down so before you put these in the oven I want you all to just slightly press them down a little to help open them out don't leave them as round as I did and um they will come off perfect so just make sure and do that flatten them out about open them out about about two inches I would say just to help the term open out easy when it goes into the oven so I hope you guys give this recipe a try let me know down below if you like it thank you for watching if you need to my channel I hope you like and subscribe and I will see you all on Oddity with another one of my recipes enjoy [Music]", "DNmyEEgkTzI": "hi everyone this is Jenny and today I want to show you how I made this Matchett cheesecake cookies with white chocolate chips and semi chocolate chunks this recipe is quite similar with the oreo cheesecake cookies I made last week I will be linking that video below so you can also check that out but for now let me show you how I mean is matcha flavored cookies now let's start basing this part off you just have to beat your room temperature cream cheese until it's soft and creamy I'm using my handy dandy hand mixer to do this but you can also do this using a spatula or a wooden spoon this helps make sure that your batter will be free from cream cheese chunks later on now once your cream cheese is soft and easy you can now add your softened butter and continue whisking I like to cut the butter and cream cheese into small chunks if I forget to take them out of the fridge early it helps bring them at room temperature faster now once your cream cheese and butter has come together you can now add the sugar and continue beating until it's also well incorporated [Music] now at this point you can now add the remaining dry ingredients which is the flour and the matcha powder I only put 2 TSP of matcha powder to give it a subtle hint of matcha flavor but you can actually add more if you want the stronger matcha flavor so just fold everything together until you're dry and wet ingredients are nicely combined I like the glue this using a spatula to avoid uber beating the batter now once you're dry and wet ingredients are nicely combined can now add your white chocolate chips and send me chocolate chunks and then just continue to fold them until they're all nicely incorporated now we are ready to bake them on a parchment lined baking tray cook your batter roughly about two tables I'm just using an ice cream scoop to make them uniform in size if you have one you can use those or just use a spoon if you don't give them about two inches of space so they don't bump into each other sleeping to make them look fancier you can add chocolate chunks and chips on top of each [Music] so we have to make these cookies at 350 degrees Fahrenheit in a preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes they will be slightly soft when they come out of the oven so give them plenty of time to cool before taking your first sight and I obviously cannot wait given that one cookie layer that did not survive through the cooling process and the tips for the master cheese cake cookies

tried to get just an egg yolk so I'm good I do it over this bowl and see pretty sure supposed to let it drop and then oh can you see that go back and forth between the sides with the yolk and it drips out any leftover I did it a little messy just have raw egg everywhere oh that's pretty Wow next step for one box white chocolate instant pudding as well as the rest of the dry ingredients baking soda salt and flour quarter teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda I got a new baking soda they're always so hard to open this just as a small box so that's what I got you know good alright and how much flour only a cup and a quarter how much of a mess do you think this will make as soon as I start mixing it look at how much dry ingredients there are ok here we go scared I'm gonna put it on the low speed oh okay I was being overly dramatic that was totally fine time for the chicks if this food 3/4 cup white chocolate and 3/4 cup milk chocolate but I don't really want to put the thing is I don't I just don't know if I'm gonna put any normal chocolate chips out of there like I wanted to be mostly white chocolate because that's what he said his favorite were white chocolate raspberry like do I even need to put an me sure just do a cup and half white chocolate I think I'm just gonna do a cup and a half white chocolate I'm going robe people this is not like me Norma always follow the recipe but I just wanna make white Chuck there hopefully this isn't a mistake all right we're doing it cup and a half white chocolate the deed is done this is what I'm worried about then really read this full recipe it says this is where it gets a little tricky take half of the cookie dough and press it down flat place small spoonfuls of raspberry preserves all over the top of the dough use a butter knife to cut the preserves into the dough don't mix it too much or the Dell will turn pink what what are you do with the second half of the dough once again whoa I went rogue like super rogue I just ran to train your joke this is Who am I 2020 new year new me and I decided this recipe seems a little crazy with this Jam I just like don't understand it I found another recipe that uses freeze-dried raspberries they had these are Trader Joe's there were just a couple bucks so here's what I'm thinking I'm gonna put some of these into my dough Clayton's drinking water and it's so loud see how it looks and then maybe I'll put like a tiny bit of the jam in I know it'll probably change the color and consistency but I think we'll be okay if we just do a little bit or maybe when I actually like scoop the cookies I'll do like dollops of the jam we start with putting this in I mean it looks pretty way now which I put more do I taste it you're on my toaster I'm golden wow there are a lot of white chocolate chips in this I feel like it needs a little better mixing honestly we're gonna try this tiny bite I know some people say Mama's people say you're not supposed to eat cookie dough but oh well well I am oh that's good actually that's really good I'm gonna do a little bit more raspberries it's gonna be our finished dough I'm gonna let it chill and I'll probably end up actually baking them tomorrow morning they're nice and fresh it's 8:30 already tonight I'm not meeting up with them until like noon tomorrow so I'll have time in the morning to and get these baked I'm gonna chill it question my life decisions and then we'll check back in in the morning let you know how they turn out [Applause] [Applause] rude good morning you guys sound actually made good morning see preheated

white chocolate chips and the delicious candy corn candy treat and we're going to be turning them into a white chocolate chip candy corn cookie let's get started to make the cookies we're going to be using 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar a 1/4 of a cup of white granulated sugar 1/2 a cup of softened butter 2 cups of all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons of heavy cream or you could use milk instead 1 egg 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract now in here I have 2 teaspoons of cornstarch which will make the cookies nice and light 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt we're going to need 1 cup of white chocolate chips and we're going to be using 1 cup of candy corn I have my stand mixer here fitted with my paddle attachment and my butter is in my bowl so I'm just going to give it a quick stir here and it's nice and soft so it'll be easy to mix so that step is just distributing the butter a little bit and now I'm going to put in my sugars so I'm going to give those a big mix and make sure it's nice and light and fluffy once the butter and sugars are together you can add your egg now I'm going to put the mixer on to low and I'm going to gradually add in my vanilla and my cream once we've got our wet ingredients added in we're going to add our flour and then we're also going to add in at the same time the baking soda cornstarch and the salt so I'm going to mix this up on low again until all of this ingredient is combined and you have a nice light and fluffy cookie dough our last step is to add in our our white chocolate chips and our candy corn we're going to just mix those up briefly and then the cookie dough will be all set for putting on to our pan I have my baking tray here lined with parchment paper and I'm going to be using a large cookie scoop which is about four tablespoons equivalent of dough so all I do to do that is I just scoop into my cookie dough and then I just plop it on to the parchment pad like that so the parchment piece of paper just like that now what you're going to do is you can bake them right away but what you might find out is that it might spread quite a bit and so if you want your cookies to be a little bit chunkier what you want to do is you want to put it into the fridge or the freezer for a couple of hours and that will just solidify your cookie dough and what that's going to do is help prevent any spreading of the cookie while it's baking so when you're baking your cookie you want to put them into the oven at 350 degrees and you're going to bake them for around 15 minutes and now what that means is that some ovens that will take about 12 minutes some ovens that might take up to 18 or 20 you just have to watch it and make sure your cookie is nice and golden brown so I'm going to put these into the fridge and then into the oven and I'll be back to show you the finished cookies so here are the completed white chocolate chip candy corn cookies I have them in the oven for about 16 minutes and like I said that might vary depending on your out depending on your oven so I'd like you to leave a comment if you liked what you saw today and remember to give it a thumbs up as well I love hearing where you guys are from and where you're watching from so make sure you give me a comment below and I will be sure to try to answer as many of them as I can so thanks for watching everybody remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you all again next time you", "TA7snO72lwU": "hello it Gemma and I'm at home and I need something sweet as usual and I'm going to show you how to make my chocolate chip cookies this is something I quite often have just frozen in my freezer the cookie dough and when I need some cookies I can just get it out slice a couple of slices off and have myself a yummy freshly baked cookie to start with I'm going to use 225 grams of softened unsalted butter start by putting that in my mixer to that add 40 grams of light soft brown sugar and 180 grams of light Muscovado sugar and that's going to give it a really nice kind of treacly soft gooeyness right so I'm going to be those together for a minute or two just to get them light and fluffy and then we'll add the move down right that's been going for about a minute it's gone lovely and fluffy and pale and now I'm going to turn it down a bit and add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract we let that mix in a little bit and then just need to add two large free-range eggs one at a time beating quite well in between each one time for my other egg right there once your eggs are all mixed in turn your mixer off and i've got 270 grams of plain flour which I've sifted and pop that in and then add to that 1 teaspoon of baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt and then we're just going to mix that on a low speed just until it's incorporated and then once it starts coming together add 250 grams of chocolate chips now I've used chopped chocolate because I like a bit of irregularity with my chips you can just use chocolate chips this is where it gets a bit exciting in here and that's it don't need to mix it too long this is what the dough looks like it's it's quite soft at the minute you can bake this now what I like to do is wrap it up in cling film in a sausage shape and stick it in the freezer all right so my cookie dough has been freezing in the freezer where things freeze for about two hours and it's now Salladhor the rack and I'm gonna now use my trusty knife and slice bits off it bake them and then right and then just pop them onto a baking tray lined with baking paper space them quite far apart because they're going to spread quite a bit these are gonna be a funny shape when they bake because my love froze and do a punishing bake them at 180 for 10 to 15 minutes so check mine at 10 if they still feel a little bit soft on the top whack them in for another couple of minutes but you want them to be soft ish in the middle 7 all nice and chilly but my cookies have been out of the oven for about five minutes and that's about as long as I can wait because I need cookie so they're still warm look how cute they are with a little uneven chunks of chocolate all over the place and I'm going to have to have a little bit yummy so soft in the middle if you liked this video and you want to see more videos by me and please do subscribe to my channel by clicking on the link over here and I'm going to go grab myself a glass of milk and don't my cooking itself see you later you"}
