{"xtba40sLaoY": "Bammer TV [Music] welcome to Bamber TV cart reviews a brand new segment on the channel where we review the best carts around now we normally do we'd review x' and we will have a playlist of that in the description we are also going to make a brand new playlist for these cart reviews so very exciting stuff here our first cart review is none other than blue dreams so very excited Dave what you have to say about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a west coast legend amongst weed it is a crossbreed between blue berry indica and a sativa known as haze and this dream child amongst these two makes it a very potent hybrid and of course when you think about blue dream automatically the flavor comes to mind it's one of the most flavorful strains around so I was really excited to taste this and it really stays true to the bud it's very flavorful the oil has a night nice light golden color to it so very appealing as well now the main difference between the strain and the oil is well the oil is a concentrated version of the weed itself so this oil right here is about 78 percent THC by volume and it has a couple of other good cannabinoids and high amounts in there but then the rest of the oil is known as terpenes and that's the flavor profile but all natural flavors that are in the bud itself now blue dream is known for having a lot of stress relieving properties to it as well as depression fighting and nausea preventing busts so that makes it a very good medicinal weed alright so normally I just cut to the score but Dave I have a two-part question for you today I want to know which one you prefer in terms of the weed strain or the oil strain and also of course the Bama rating me personally Pat I really enjoy the flour from Blue Dream it's been a little bit since I've smoked it however I do remember all those beautiful floral notes especially when you use it so it's one of my favorite strains to smoke as far as my Bimmer rating for this cart I mean we started off with a really really good one so we asked her to make it known that this is a really good kart right off the bat I'm gonna give this one a four out of five okay so there you go a legendary strain translating very well to a legendary oil so that is our first cart review guys if you like this video smash the like button think about subscribing and for everything else and weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "XyR0gPiEahE": "hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real mad he smokes

title it is another cartridge video uh it's another populous herb cartridge video you know i only have i would say about one and a half videos on it i do have another video where you know we're we've just picked up pop herbs but i didn't really you know get into detail um the other flavors were pretty good um but i just had to i just had to try blue dream for myself i don't know i'm not really fond of blue dream but i rarely see it in a cartridge and i figured you know it's nine dollars you know if you didn't see my other papa herbs video it's nine dollars for a half gram cart of blue dream so you know i had to pop cop it and uh let me know you guys opinion on blue dream homie stevie says that purple punch is the new blue dream let me know your thoughts on that that's what he says but yeah it's the cartridge itself i already been smoking on it as you can tell you know they don't come this low but very very enjoyable very very candy-like uh i wouldn't say blueberry taste but i don't let's just get it handy i'm gonna put it in my tutron family so cheers like i get a slight weird taste to it like the similar taste that you would get from like i don't know it's like that weird black licorice taste i don't know if it's exactly it's like a weird taste but then you get the the the sweetness uh kind of um like a like a candy taste um but overall good it is just lit when it comes to papa herbs it is going to be distillate uh if you didn't see the back it is running at 87.60 or 87.63 percent uh packaged on packaged on august 10th of 2020 and uh it says right here manufactured by sublime so yeah uh i mean the cartridge itself very very nice but for those of you who are expecting live resin you're not going to get that for nine dollars for a half gram but overall very very good for your budget cartridge smokers you know if you have nine dollars after you purchase all this stuff and you want to get a cartridge you know i'll definitely recommend this and i'd like to say that nine dollars is the price that i pay in modesto california obviously it's going to be different where you're from even different dispensaries in same cities range different prices so just please just keep that in mind when you're like looking for this car it's not going to be nine dollars if you're not where i'm at you know i'm saying so but yeah blue dream very very good strain from them uh as of right now the probably the best strain that i've tried from papa herbs their cartridges is the gelato but i would say that maybe this is the second best out of all the ones that i've tried i've tried forbidden fruit i've tried wedding cake the consensus with my friends saying that the wedding cake is actually the best but i didn't really like it it's too i don't know i just didn't i mean it's not bad but i didn't enjoy it as much as i would say this or the forbidden fruit one which kind of added like a little pomegranate taste and you guys know like i'm not i don't prefer my cartridges to taste like fruits and all that stuff because it just i think it they don't get me as high when it tastes like fruit it has to taste like wheat to me and it might just be a thing in my brain that kind of just does it's like an anti-placebo or placebo um but yeah it just i don't i don't hate it you know obviously there's some pros to it you know like if i'm smoking this they're just going to think that i'm hitting a blueberry vape or something but yes i do prefer you know when it tastes like the butt itself cannabis derived terpenes instead of fruity terpenes but nonetheless still a really really good buy you know i still this like maybe the the second this is the second time i bought a papa herbs cartridge and it's because it's so affordable and why not you know and uh yeah like like i said in the first pop earth video when it costs nine dollars uh and it's good it's a win-win because at the end of the day it's nine dollars and it's good and even it like it's so cheap you know what i'm saying like even if you did pay nine dollars and it's shitty you just paid nine dollars you know so i'm gonna take one more hit one more no actually two more hits i'm gonna take another one and then i'm gonna show you guys how much smoke i'm actually getting or vape or whatever cheers oh you see don't have that much left but it's been getting me getting me through the week you feel me oh all right let's take start here peace out guys [Music] you", "7MWC1JbP12E": "hey guys so I got another review here I got this fresh cartridge it's a 1 gram it was on sale for 30 bucks so it seemed like a good deal on paper 96 percent supposedly tested THC nothing really fancy going on here it looks like a new company you know it's not a super corporate looking so I decided to give him a try see see if they're legit or not it's blue dreams Teva you know it's the beginning of the day so it's definitely stat Eva time so go ahead and give it a try got a couple different batteries here cuz sometimes cards don't like to work on the push-button ones or inhale time so we'll see what this is about it looks pretty nice golden color it's a full gram see that faint looks pretty pretty thick it looks like a thick liquid that's a good sign let's see my try it on this regular pure vapor pull type battery it doesn't have a button I'm gonna see if it works on this first it's lighting up but I'm not getting anything out of it let's try one of these and it was good okay so I turned this all the way up the red push-button one and it does seem to work I guess these regular 3.5 hole types was they were it just wasn't strong enough or something maybe it'll start working you know once the fluid starts going through here but these amsterdam batteries just the regular push-button kind of generic type seem to work a lot better so let me see here it's got a real weedy taste to it you know it's not sweet no beating around the bush with this one it definitely tastes weedy it doesn't taste super high quality but it doesn't taste like there's any chemicals or anything in there which is a good sign [Music] it just really tasted the garbed weed I can really taste you know the D card process you know it tastes kind of like burnt weed I'm gonna try and turn this lower see ya it tastes a little better yeah I guess the medium settings where it's supposed to be but yeah there's no frills no you know through fruit flavor and this or anything just straight-up blue dream you know I'm hoping this blue dream you know I'm hoping it's not just some generic sativa they're calling blue dream and just putting you know trying to put blue dream terpenes in there or something yeah they don't taste like you know man-made terpenes it tastes like legit like this is the actual flavor of it so I'm gonna smoke on this for a little bit my tolerance isn't exactly what it used to be so I'll probably take about you know five or six hits on this really quick and I'm gonna come back and let you guys know what's up all right all right so I'm just finishing up my stash here with this I took maybe about seven hits or so and I gotta say I'm already feeling it feels really good it's definitely a sativa you know it's a it's a strong sativa you do get that like racy and feely and you know just sitting here so you definitely want to be out and do like doing something I'm gonna get up here and you know get to work but uh yeah it feels really really strong I'm actually pretty impressed I was expecting you know this would be a total lie obvious like honestly and I'm actually pretty high it feels really good it's leaps and bounds better than the h1 was and it's even cheaper so you know definitely get something like this over h1 I'm super high right now definitely give this a thumbs up I would definitely get more if you can find these for $30 go for it for sure I would even pay 45 for this I'm definitely gonna order more at 30 bucks pleasantly surprised fresh good brand definitely a thumbs up I would say it's even better than the pure vape ones as you can see this is really nice and thick again it doesn't really like to work on these whole type batteries the variable you know wattage push-button ones seems to work pretty good on so you know keep that in mind yeah thumbs up thumbs up on this go ahead go ahead and buy them you won't be disappointed definitely worth it try and look for this brand", "vjpOd1fTKgQ": "[Music] what's up guys is I bring dink for a 20 I'm back with a new review my bad guys I've been you know I've been busy doing some other things so I've been forgetting to drop any reviews but since I got myself on some new pens and some new cartridges this is a kind of watch because y'all been waiting for all these reviews y'all been asking me for them so here y'all go and this is just a random one I chose which to me right now might be one of my favorites because of the strain that it is it's blue dream and it's it's a carvanha you see yeah I put it the curve onna you see that it comes in a little doobie - and it's a Capon originals in its blue dream it's a full gram sativa excuse me there's a four grams of tivo and these are the v2 pens basically Pravana does have another packaging and they come like in a cardboard box kind of like how the raw gardens come in and all these other cartridges but these are the ones that used to do before and you know they're not really that old I confirm with them as well that this is an original cartridge is not a fake I got it from a licensed dispensary so I know for sure that I bought the correct product just how I got my I got my raw gardens from a licensed dispensary - so I have nothing to worry about any of the cartridges I have right here guys nor do you if you're getting up from a licensed dispensary you have nothing to worry about because all the little epidemic about the cartridge going around is mainly where black market carts I know there was a couple comments that people were saying that it's with with um with dispensary cards - but most likely if they were getting a dispensary card they were buying a fake dispensary card like one of those blackmarket cards the dispensaries decided to sell just like the things like the way that I found a bank vape at a dispensary which was really weird to me but I did find it there it's probably something like that so I was on the border to that way until I turned myself around I was like you know what I'm not buying this [ __ ] again I'm just gonna stick to the real deal I'm gonna start paying more for something that's good then paying less for something that can kill me in the far run but anyways this is the raw garden um this was funky Munky and look at this guy's this shit's bone-dry it took me about but like let me see if it even has a hit took me about like three or four days still had a hit but is literally out but it took me about like three or four days to finish this half gram cartridge reason why the Toyota truth might be because as I read the words refined life resin so it's basically not THC distill it it's a it's a different form of concentrate oh and I ain't gonna lie like two or three hits off of one of these it has you good I'm talking about real good so that was one of the main reasons why it took me almost a week almost five days for it to get like for me to finish it because of how strong it was and how little bit I had to like use to feel the high you feel me but these right here is my first time trying them guys and the THC percentage on this carvanha blue dream is running at it says seven hundred and seventy one point eighty milligrams which turns into 77.18 percent THC there's one of the lowest the lowest cartridges on THC I have but it's one it's the biggest cartridge I have which is a full ground it has a California symbol it also says Auto cartridge one gram it tells you right here the manufacture date was January 23rd 2019 the package date was January 30th of 2019 and its best by January 23rd of 2020 so you got a whole year or basically right now you literally happen to that so next year in January to finish this so you should be done with it in no time like it should not take you that long but they come sealed with like this clear tape like right there so all you got to do is literally like and then just pop it off you can see the clear tape right here look at this how you really got do you can just peel it and just break it off right there and you still you can still see like it won't peel anything off of their sticker but after you take off the little tape and open the doobie tube cartridge slides right out look at this guy's this is a four gram cartridge you see that little bubble and almost every dispensary Kurt I've gotten does not come completely full I know everybody used to be bitching about this one day when there was a dig they've surrounded they were like 1.1 grams and it had to be completely full ya know dispensary card I've gotten has came completely full they all have a little bubble I guess for the air floor for this space I'm not sure but they all come with a little bubble and to me that's that's not really a bad a bubble it's it's alright you feel me if you look at this though the the coil and everything from this cartridge it looks just like the brass knuckles cartridge that is like fully thick from the bottom and then it it comes all the way up and it starts getting thinner so it's a pretty big coil from the bottom and then it comes with a little rod and it likes it comes dinner out so you can tell that right here at the bottom is not really holding that much oil because there's such little space but if you can see right inside in that little coil there's a letter K for carvanha they won't focus do but right inside the cartridge there's a letter K and a 2 on the other side so you know there's a K 2 and it says blue BL you D so blue dream K pen with a triangle and to tell the truth I haven't seen none of these kuranes nor raw garden nor um was another cartridge bright labs I haven't seen none of cards just get any fakes here so if they're not getting any fakes then they're good that means not a lot of people have either found out about them or not a lot of people have taken their time to make counterfeits for them but like brass knuckles kingpins and all that they all have fakes these don't haven't seen any if you look at this oil to look there ain't no hot dog water here guys there ain't no hot dog water they ain't none of that [ __ ] as oil with all that vitamin E acetate no no this is pure THC distilling really gold no [ __ ] oil it is moving in Israel it's moving really slow look at that I know people are getting like those row of cartridges guys if you're buying the wrong cartridge from the plug it's a [ __ ] fake there ain't no plug selling you real [ __ ] I'm sorry I don't know how I can tell you this but there ain't no plug really selling real [ __ ] you might as well go buy it from the dispensary spend the more couple bucks and stop being cheap and buying a row of cartridge for like 40 bucks a real row of cartridge at a dispensary for a half gram is about 40 bucks so if you're getting the full gram for 40 bucks then it's fate second of all I think the flow gram is like 60 bucks or even a little bit more and I know the packaging looks real on all these cartridges but it's not because if you look at their website the row of cartridges at the very bottom of their box let me show you a better example but at the very bottom of the road box they're supposed to have a little barcode that you're supposed to be able to scan tour to identify it so I think identify my bad if your cartridge is authentic a lot of these fake cartridges guys they don't have that little barcode at the bottom of their box they look everything else looks real like the whole box looks real everything is says looks real like golden go and all these strains that they made from friendly farms or the black boxes but it's still missing your your ID if your sticker to be able to identify your cartridge if your cartridge is real they should have a sticker on it for the row of cartridges if you don't have it then it's it's a fake that you can buy on DHgate you can see a whole bunch of [ __ ] on DHgate you'll find a whole bunch of row of cartridges cookie cards kingpins heavy hitters brass knuckles dr. zodiac moon rock cards steezy pods it's a whole bunch of [ __ ] they got almost all the card brands them the very known card brands that they're doing that too but you don't have to worry about them with this or with the raw garden raw gardens are really hard to duplicate because of the color of the oil and because it's live resin a lot of people can make live resin just like that so let's let's pop this bad boy and let's get to the review my better guys I've been ranting a little bit too much but I'm using my moon rock battery for gram cartridge cheers guys let's go for the first Hey I'll let y'all know the flavor and then I'll let y'all know how I feel after the 38 oh this is really nice as so his blue dream and it has a very light hint of blueberries it's not is not a strong hit but like a strong flavor is very light like after I hit like while I wasn't healing I wasn't tasting it it was more when I was like releasing the smoke or doing the ghost that it was that I was tasting the flavor but it's really smooth and sweet not too sweet but just right and you just you can smell it on the tip of the cartridge okay you can smell the blueberries let's go for the second hit if you can tell even after I heated it up it's still thick as oil it's not nothing that hotdog water no runny [ __ ] I'm sorry guys but I ain't going back to those [ __ ] black market carts I care too much about my health Tevan go back even if like you know I wasn't really giving a [ __ ] before but you got to the point that when I started finding what was really going on yeah I ain't [ __ ] with it let's go for a second it it's [ __ ] good guys I ain't gonna lie ever since I stopped smoking all those black market cards my cough has gotten better it's not like that dry cough that I used to have and you know my my bong hits when I take a barn hit now I can I can do what I used to do cuz I used to think like really big bong hits I'm not fully there yet but I mom was there and I'm almost able to do what I used to be able to do that he's just take a whole ball hit and then like you know just like let it go out like uninhibit but when I was smoking all those black market carts I wasn't able to do that I would be able to take like a very not too big of a hit and almost start choking at the same time because my lungs are like really weak but ever since I kept going with the dispensary cards I've been feeling better I wouldn't get those headaches that I used to get I used to get like minor morning headaches when I would wake up after I've been hitting that cartridge all day like the day before and I don't get that with these cartridges so that's a good thing as well let's go for the 32 here guys I'm really baked Cheers I'm baked this [ __ ] I'm high as hell it's a little hot in the house too so I'm a little I'm a little sweaty right now just took a shower but the flavor tastes like blueberries which is a coincidence because it is blue dream but it's freakin delicious guys I gotta give it a ten out of ten the high it's if it's it is as a TiVo but I'm I'm like really baked right now I don't even know how to say like I almost froze like twice right now but I gotta give it a ten out of ten as well Wrangell i these dispensary carts are freaking amazing guys so if you haven't got one yet I definitely recommend you a carvanha and this carvanha from where I got it from it ran me about for a full game it was like 40 bucks the half gram was 20 bucks and a full grandmother of the Capon Cavanaugh's was 40 bucks yeah 40 bucks plus taxes was like 45 40 somewhere around there but that's usually what I used to hear people pay for like a a dank babes in different states so just get the real deal guys stay safe stay high and let me finish this off with another Hey Cheers also this cartridge definitely gets 20 points like 10m flavor and turn on high so I definitely recommend it carvanha keep doing routine I will be trying your cartridges they also have grapefruit cush Master OG and I think they have like one more thing goes banana or something like that for the K pens but they're actually really good so definitely recommend them stay hi guys thank you for watching stay tuned and don't forget to Like and subscribe and comment down below peace out", "2Ez-_fyqK7g": "[Music] you know like I'm completely protected from this I

"p4joBq4g6A8": "hey guys I'm posted I just picked up on a blue cart boom there you go yeah I'm gonna be reviewing it seeing how it is if it's good it tastes nice you know ever gets me high oh yeah get to it please sure you just pull this this came out today was a good day I only use a blue battery keep away from heat and Sun if clog of the Curie's detach the battery unit and help through the cartridge until the clog has been fully dislodged basically just how to use it I don't need this you hear that it's like Christmas right now okay I'm [ __ ] confused oh okay it was this side take that out boom so it's here let's go hopefully this is real you know some face shape but if it is Wow I guess it was 20 bucks that's pretty sketch but I was like I don't know maybe he's like running out well like nobody's really buying it I don't know why the [ __ ] it's 20 but Browns greens on boom I have this battery but I don't I forgot what it's called it's moving but very slowly I [ __ ] what they go oh it's pretty like yellow it looks like a like the KRT oil I don't know how I feel about that I didn't really like the Quixote's we're trying something new so let's go this battery I'm gonna show you guys how it works here's to like turn up the heat look at this 3.8 here's the power button / the hit button to like press it to take a you know whatever I'm over this review let's go see how it tastes it smells like sugar smoke like honey I'm scared what I'm smoking honey breath okay I'm just hitting it tastes like [ __ ] sugar that's what I'm saying like what the fight this should taste like sugar like I don't know something sweet sweet sweet sweet oh it's cool I've heard of these before though the Bloom cards this kid in my class he would always talk about it he got so high that off like one blinker he was like darling he could feel it as soon as he was hitting it and [ __ ] this one I don't know like I feel like you overhyped it I don't know if you were just excited or maybe I just got a fake one I don't know like I don't know what the situation is right now but because it doesn't taste like wax you know it tastes like sugar do you like I don't know how to explain it let me take another hey you know I'm tripping make sure you guys are smoking with me not this for you yeah that should taste sweet as food people like overall I don't really know how to feel about this I don't know if I got a rule one ever I would have got it from a dispensary I would have loved it pretty good card for like cheap you know but I got it from a plug so that makes it halis good just like so scared to sleep I just got it because it was 20 bucks and I was like dude like that kid was always talking about is a lip mac and B get it I'm asked for their opinions yeah they like yeah they like oh froley like keep smoking they don't like it I'll throw it away book that I'm trying to get what you could get from like smoking pesticides and [ __ ] probably [ __ ] bad you know probably overall just sketch about it because I got a funny play basically because you know what I mean I've never picked up from that play I don't know if it rings fake shit's not gonna wanted to get my reaction to be oh you guys all that Tennessee doesn't really see how much place we're presenting it whatever I'm over this review I don't like it was a waste 20 bucks and I saw it at the dispensary and probably get it though cuz you know I know that it's legit this though trash trash absolute trash anyways hope you guys enjoyed this little review in the next video peace", "PTlwxjeW9u8": "what's up in the following video i'm going to be reviewing two delta 8 thc vape carts by the company arita hemp so this is my first time trying any delta 8 at all so i'm excited to see what happens let's check it out and this is the official unboxing so here we have a cool postcard here special note it's pretty cool what else we got in here this is the sticker notice to law enforcement customs and all regulatory authorities i'm not going to be taking this any crazy places so i don't really have to worry about that you have the research lab of this specific strain and all the data here so maybe i'll probably check that out in more depth later the piso resistance however you say it i'm not french oh nice durbin poison kush i didn't order this i just guess they threw that in there which was awesome smells like bud to me so what i got here were these two limitless cartridges og kush and blue dream so i'm gonna switch up camera angles here in a moment i have both of these sitting upright just so the oil settles in i'm going to do that for let that happen for about 30 minutes i believe o.g kush is the indica and the blue dream is the sativa so i will be back in a bit to try those out and let you know what i think this is kind of funny not really since this is a review video but i put the cartridge on and i realized i said both of them next to each other so i don't know which one's which i have no idea what i am vaping right now it's either og kush or blue dream so it's either an indica or a sativa but whatever i just took one hit i just got this pen so i was making sure i was preheating it properly so tastes good i've never been one to uh you know care so much about the taste just really the effects but give me a second here [Music] you know i always do that i was under always underestimate with these pens here but initial thoughts um i'd say similar to my experience with like you know cbd hemp flour at least right now i'm going to do a separate video on that that's a product that i tried in the past say a month or so ago and i want to give a breakdown on that but anyway as i'm talking i definitely feel like i'm a lot more you know kind of like getting in my head a little bit almost like that feeling of you know if you had uh number nine it's kind of calming down so it's that little kind of initial oomph and then just kind of oh nothing else is really happening but i know this is much different because this is not just you know cbd hemp bud or whatever i never had the delta eight before but i'm definitely feeling that nice you know calm effect really [Music] hmm [Music] well i do like this for sure my plan was i haven't eaten dinner yet i'm gonna walk to the store so i'm feeling good still just like a little bit more of i'd say more of an intense feeling than the uh just like you know cbd bud so it's interesting i'm interested to see what it will feel like if this feeling will continue to kind of build and it's just uh pretty much an a stronger effect as the feeling i described before i'm not feeling like i'm just completely baked or anything like that i mean i know that's not gonna happen with this stuff anyway but just based on the amount because i know there's a lot of people have said that you know if they don't have a certain tolerance to it they aren't used to aren't used to this specifically this delta eight it you know it could be a bit different until you build up a tolerance versus you know how many hits or drags or whatever you would uh take on it and yeah i guess i've noticed that that you know that voice always going on your head not in a you know schizophrenic sense but you know just that constant voice of you know saying anxiety whether it be i'm not really experiencing any anxiety you know before or after i was or not after i don't even know yet but before i film this you know i haven't you know had any you know say bad anxiety today or anything like that really to speak of in the first place but it's one of those things where now even though i was going to cut this video off but i feel much more i'd say much more aware and in the sense that you know we're always we can always be this aware in the sense where i feel very present because it's a matter of being able to let go and detach from that voice that's going on as far as you know even the anxious voice or whatever however kind of plays out in your head whether it be the voice or just that big jumble of scenarios and images and everything that's like uh like a very low tv volume in the background that's always going and sometimes it's pleasant sometimes it's not so pleasant but that has calmed down drastically and it's almost like when certain as i'm speaking right now as when certain thoughts or things would come up that would allow you to just kind of go on this thought track whether it be good or bad i can almost sense them in a way of kind of rising up but then i don't attach to them and that's a really nice feeling so hope that makes sense it's uh i feel like it will to a lot of people but that's just my initial thoughts on it now i don't know what's going to you know be the case say an hour from now two hours from now but i'm going to as i said a little bit ago walk to the store just grab some food come back make some dinner and just go about my evening and then see what happens all right it is about two hours later and i think that was the blue dream i mean if i were to take a guess it's going to be cool to tomorrow try the other try the same time same circumstances and see so i can actually see a difference because i literally don't know which one was which but overall absolutely fantastic it's one of those odd things that happens to me like as i'm say walking to the store or for the past you know hour or so i was i tend to do this when i you know smoke or whatever and you know whether even with uh the hemp bud but you know i was getting way out there and in a good way just like thinking about like these different goals and nature of like reality in my life and perception and how all these things are tied together i watched a lot of actualized.org leo stuff so if anyone else watches this stuff then you probably you know know what i'm getting at and that you know you probably vibe with what i'm saying in some way shape or form with that but the other than that you know feeling great it was that very just nice positive mood type feeling and then also not in a not in a fake way just a very real just you know positive mood but yeah so overall a thousand percent i would recommend trying this out i think it's fantastic you know while this stuff is great it's not something i would suggest doing every single day or anything like that and i'm gonna you know make sure i try to not do that at least to that higher extent because as with anything i feel like we'll all build up even just a mental dependency to something but that's my take on it right now because that's been my take on that with certain things in the past so that's my overall experience a thousand percent i would check it out for yourself if you're interested at all this is my first time with using any you know anything with delta eight in it and i think it's fantastic so i will be back for day number two when i try the other one whichever it is the og kush or the blue dream leave me any comments below if you've tried this stuff before if you thought about it whatever the hell you want to say subscribe for all that fun stuff you know hopefully this will kind of get me going in the groove of like oh yeah maybe i kind of want to post videos and do more videos more frequently in this realm and i'm going to shoot this next one tomorrow and compare the whatever it was to the whatever it was so yeah see in the next video thanks for watching", "0U_qoje4lL0": "hello everybody matt CEO here mr. matt CEO let's go on everybody it's letting you know overdue another video here this one here we're doing on wayfarer

THC value slide that decimal point one point to the left we're gonna have eighty-one percent THC value with a CBD value of 0 milligrams on per gram which is zero point zero percent no CBD and this at all this is a heavy hitter as far as sativa is concerned great great product as far as relieving stress definitely makes you have that little bit of that floaty feeling inside of your body lets you have that cerebral high you know makes if it takes that load off of you for sure gives you that that feeling of you know reassurance that you know things are not as bad as they seem you know we're gonna slide her in here oh can I do it today can I do it today look at this so close chance it's so funny that I even try Hey so Wayfarer product is top-shelf products you're going to be paying about I would say $65 or so for a point 5 gram of this which is absolutely stupid but in the long run you get what you pay for so myself I'm not a very big user of Wayfarer I'm or did it to test and see how the product is compared to a lot of two other ones so this one here of course is blue a dream I'm a big fan of flower blue dream as well but this stuff here like I say I've been using it since well a couple days now this oil is really really tasty this oil is really really good as far as high potency taking away stress feelings taken away you know kinda makes you feel in a nice little lull doesn't make you feel tired doesn't make you munch out too bad nothing like that so I'll give it a whirl now that's nice bad that's smooth all bad that's good that is real smooth this is Oh it hits you you feel it in your chest you kind of get that kind of a feeling you know what I mean like that it's a instant relief he type feeling it kind of makes you feel just nice and on top takes away a little bit of that edge do you know you feel like that or sometimes your enemy takes that away almost instantly and like I said this stuff tastes pardon me this stuff tastes beautifully good so I am a supporter of Wayfarer as you can see this fits of five to ten threads so as you know we now have seen good supply and top Li fit on to this five to ten straight draw straws in they all work no problem Li fine so you know they're all interchangeable by one you can use all of these and this pen is great man takes about a day or so to charge fully and it's been great I have no problems it's an auto draw straw

sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive

how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "7uXJuvzGYgU": "hey what's up Jason would Sheba's vape supplies here today we're going to be discussing for a few minutes our high-end vape cartridge that's available in point five mil and also one mil it's a ceramic coil here let's check it out so boom this is a very very heavy duty cartridge it has top-of-the-line metal and glass it also has gold connectors at the bottom I'm sorry gold plated connectors at the bottom of the cartridge where it's makes contact with the 510 thread battery and it also has gold plated connectors at the bottom of the actual shaft itself there's for intake holes for your oil to go down to the ceramic oil and one of the best things about this cartridge is when you do remove the mouthpiece and the center comes out with it you have this huge hole here to fill up your cartridge with oil through a syringe or what other means you use to fill up your cartridges and there's a line on there that tells you where to fill it through because that way when you replace the middle with the mouthpiece that takes up the rest of your volume raising the level other oil in the cartridge and then the other thing on this cartridge is it has an adjustable mouthpiece so you could twist this thing to reveal or cover up holes to make it easier or more difficult to inhale and depend upon who your customers are and so forth it's a very heavy duty cartridge again it is available this is the half mil here in my hands and it is also available in one mil as well again the line is out in there to show you where to fill it to and then when you replace the outside mouthpiece in the middle mm-hmm everything goes together very nicely there's gaskets at the top of the mouthpiece here also when you seal it

"whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october

guys quote my live you will see i was turned up to a honey rather in fact a hundred thousand so i did enjoy this weekend and i got two products that also helped me enjoy this weekend guys you guys might want to check them out they're at another super store these i only shop at two superstores guys only deal with two superstars all right dr ganja and my other guy y'all guys already know who that is so dr ganja they have a bigger variety of the d8 cards right now guys right so i got two of them right now just to show you guys i and y'all guys know how i am about these d8s i'm still dealing with them until i find out that they're um really really not good for you or something happens to me so i'm like uh a guinea pig for you guys all right so um i hope you guys appreciate that too so this is coming in from dr ganja those are my guys over there i love dr ganja guys so when you get your package you will receive a card with all of their information it's a thank you for your purchase and ways to contact them also and yes you do get dope stickers they come in different colors so i don't know which one you guys gonna get in the pack when you get them and i got two cards guys i got the mango kush that's this one here all right and i think um the company that made this is um herbal farmer rx and um this mango kush has 92 percent delta eight thc this is a foreground and it says here [Music] it has a whole bunch of warning labels as far as don't take this operate heavy machinery you know the usual and um it also lets you know that this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease they have a barcode that can be scanned right there i haven't opened this one yet so let's open this up and i know this one is very very turkey deprived i mean derived as far as they put a lot of flavoring in it i guess because this one has a darker color than i'm used to with delta eight i usually have them nice and clear like the canon eight i'm going to show you guys that too and uh this one has flavor so i want to see what it tastes like we're going to hook this one up right now and then we'll go over the candy aid as well but i just want to let you guys know how this one is and this is the mango cush guys that i'm hooking up i get that later not a big deal but just let me hook this up real quick and only take 30 seconds all you got to do is get the rubbers over there now i'm gonna put it on to my battery okay and i like this battery a lot i have a few of them but this is actually my favorite battery guys so if you see it a lot that's because it's my favorite so check this out guys it's all hooked up to the battery and this is what the mango kush is looking like i'm going to turn this on low i always start off low let me tell you guys um i made a mistake with one of my delta 8 carts and i was using them on high and um at the end when it got low i noticed that i was getting um it was getting stuck basically and i had to pull real real hard to get it and i figured if i just turned down the voltage on my battery it would help and it did okay so i haven't had that problem anymore so it's not getting clogged up so i have it on the lowest setting as you guys can see that's me just heating it up a little now i'm gonna let you guys know what the flavors like [Music] definitely got some mango up in there definitely got some mango up in here yes so you guys could get it just like this that has that natural flavor okay [Music] this one is the white widow guys okay this white widow is a cross between the brazilian sativa land race and uh resin heavy south indian indica wow sounds good but what i do like about that one the canon eight is that it makes you talk alive i had a few friends over this weekend and i had them try that out and nobody could shut up so that right there is definitely a sativa uplifting blah blah blah blah blah thing right there i like it very good for company guys and this one right now i'm just enjoying the taste and i haven't got the effects yet this one is 92 percent delta 8 thc so [Music] there's a little less than this one here which is the canon eight and this one has 95 percent guys all right but there's no delta nine tac detected so all of this is coming from cannabinoids from cbd hemp so i don't know how they did it but the minute they make the flower have these effects oh man it's gonna be a beautiful day so it takes a little getting used to with that mango flavor me personally i am not big on flavor flavor when it comes to any card whether it's cbd whether it's uh even the regular cards any card i'm not big on the flavor i take that natural taste [Music] but for everybody that loves flavor this thing is packed this is packed let me grab the wrapper okay so like i said this delta eight mango kush thc is a good taste to it me i'm just not a fan of flavors in my [ __ ] that's okay um it's nothing but added chirps so it's not like it's a bad thing it's just that me personally i don't know if it's just that i'm a type dude but um this flavor is really good you know i just prefer natural guys naturally but i can't get with it so i do feel the effects right now and this one has more of a calming effect if you ask me the uh canon 8 we're going to hook that up right now let me just take this off put this to the side now the canon has that natural flavor natural terps is the white widow strand and let me hook this up real quick guys see i tell you it's definitely doing its job because i'm starting to feel nice warm and fuzzy guys nice warm and fuzzy and it's kind of chilly in um atlanta today guys also so all right so we already got it hooked up so this is the canon eight white widow right here delta eight and if y'all guys could see i just preheated a little bit before i take a pull that's just the way i do it [Music] now this tastes great this really does and it's also a little stronger so gotta be careful gotta be careful [Music] but i tell you guys i've been loving it and a lot of other people they hit me up they're also loving the delta eight so we haven't tried it yet the prices are good here on dr ganja's website so y'all guys go ahead check them out for real not only that they got flour they have accessories they have you name it they got it basically all right apparel so whatever you guys need you probably will be able to get from this so this is another superstore smoke dr shops at guys this candy it's delicious [Music] man this thing is great i love this one this one i like effect wise but i'm just not big on flavor so anybody that loves flavoring and you know that's definitely the way to go this mango kush has a ton of flavor in it guys all right so it says um i already told you guys this is a full grain directions for use hit vape cartridge until desired results are achieved and that's where we are now guys so i think we're going to wrap this one up for now but let me tell you i'm going to continue my quest to find the best d8 out their canon eight is good i really really like that one and i also like this one but not as much as the canon eight all right that's just my preference y'all guys go try them out for y'all so i will put a link below the video there is a small discount if you use my link so there you go guys all right so smoke doctor is signing out for now and i'll be back with another review soon guys all right peace [Music]", "hxxVrOv-v1I": "stop buying fake vape carts off the street because you know what you are smoking chemicals and i'm going to show you the chemicals you're smoking and it's not going to be nice you're going to feel disgusted and unfortunately that's what people do when they live in illegal states where marijuana is not legal but i'm going to give you a solution so if you live in a state where marijuana and thc vapes are not legal i'm going to show you how you can get it anywhere in the country online shipped right to your door but anyways my name's chris i'm with cbd and thc extract.co and i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and by the way if you haven't tried our hemp flour yet hit the link in the description below and you can get an eighth of our flour completely for free doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link below to claim the offer but anyways if you've been on the street you know that these glow carts and supreme cards and all these different carts are all over the place and even in illinois where weed is legal people are buying these illegal street brands literally because it's cheaper than the dispensary that's kind of sad but unfortunately there's a lot of price gouging in illinois but anyways i digress these carts actually have lead and ethyl acetate in them specifically glow carts so if you look at the lab test i'm going to pop it up on the screen right now what you're going to see in these lab tests is that there's trace amounts of lead probably in the hardware itself right heavy metals and you can see that there's ethyl acetate as well who knows if they're using it as a cutting agent or maybe it's part of the hardware as well but ethyl acetate is basically a derivative of glue um yeah you don't want to be smoking glue i mean do you want to be vaping glue do you want to inhale heavy metals because i don't know if you remember the vape epidemic that went on and i think it was 2019 about last year and kids were getting sick from vape sucks that it was kids really they should have been adults but um supposedly the theory is is that these kids were smoking vape cartridges that were basically street carts right and these street carts what they had in them is the lead or heavy metals or cutting agents and specifically with the lead obviously is very toxic that's why they took it out the pencils in school now they use graphite um because it was literally kids were dying same thing with the vape ironically and basically they were vaping oil all the way down to the bottom of the cart and when they vaped it to the bottom of the cart they started to burn the wick and the heating element and when they burned that heating element not only were they burning the heating element but they were inhaling the toxic lead that was contained in that heating element and come on really do you want to save a couple bucks and inhale chemicals i mean do you want to end up like those kids in the hospital literally last year and even with covet going on i mean health is everyone's number one priority right now i think everyone's has that priority and here's the funny thing glow cart's the company they try to act all transparent like oh we got these uh little qr codes where you can verify it's real that doesn't mean anything because you can go to dhgate.com and buy the packaging and you could buy the empty carts by yourself for dirt cheap so and the thing is even if you get the real glow carts the real ones from glow carts whatever that is whatever that entity is it's it's funny because the lab test that they posted shows the lead and it shows the ethyl acetate in the product maybe they thought just because they have a lab test that it's okay and it's totally safe maybe they don't even know how to read a laptop and obviously no one else does because no one looks into the stuff they just see oh thc vape let me smoke that or let me vape that they don't really look into the details they don't think what kind of vape cartridge is it what kind of is it distillate oils they're cutting agents right what kind of turps are they using they don't look into any of this stuff they just see oh like that looks cool cool packaging bro it's cheaper than the dispensary or i can't get it anywhere else that's just really sad you don't want to end up in the hospital but anyways if you want a solution what i'm going to tell you is there's a new product that's out on the market it's taking the hemp market by storm it's pretty crazy it's called delta 8 thc and basically because of the 2018 farm bill that the president signed basically what it did is it legalized hemp derived compounds for example delta 8 thc can be derived from hemp so basically if you get thc and extracted from hemp now it's legal federally which means you can buy it online and you can get it shipped to your door so what you can do is you can go online right now and type in delta 8 thc cartridge and buy thc right now and the thing that's great about it is that if you're 18 that's fine because most dispensaries are 21 and up for hemp the federal law is that it's only 18. 18 plus watch out there but anyways it's only 18 plus and it's cheaper than the dispenser at least here in illinois the cartridges at the dispensary like 72 bucks for half a gram for a cart where a delta 8 cartridge online is you know anywhere from 50 60 bucks and it gets shipped to your door that's before discounts and whatnot so point is if you want to buy delta a thc and protect your health and stay away from the dirty street vendors that are putting cutting agents and chemicals in your products that you're inhaling into your lungs i'm going to leave a link down below where you can buy delta a thc a couple of vendors you can get your hands on it and try it out for yourself it's just like the delta nine only it's delta eight has a double bond instead of a single bond on a molecular level i'm not a chemist or anything but i know that much so i hope you enjoy that information about why you should never ever smoke vape carts off the street ever again because it's really just disgusting so if you like content like this leave a comment let me know what you think but thanks have a great day", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of dispenser here in illinois and we're actually going to be approaching people to let them try delta 8 thc so they can see what they think about it because right now everyone's buying carts in there but little do they know they could get it online shipped to their door so we're going to approach some random people let them try delta athc see what they think and just get their reactions could be super fun and by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris from cbdxtract.co if you haven't tried hempflower yet do me a favor and hit the link down below you can get an eighth of our hemp flower completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer click the link so anyways that covers it let's get right into it so we just met eli over here at the dispensary we pulled them up and said hey do you want to test out the trc cart have you ever do you know what delta athc is i do really what do you know about it well i know it's high in thc below ncb oh yeah and when you go buy a car you don't want nothing to do with cvd the cbd is is low you want to be in a future video dude you want to give me a free card you do sure all right let me let me grab another flavor from my car youtube video what's it what's this how long have you been smoking [Music] oh quite a while okay you try it out see what your thoughts are here you got a nice one it does have a lemony flavor that's just pretty good i'll be honest i like that [ __ ] really yeah hell yeah yeah as far as like what you're feeling like what would you say like the effects are i feel loose um energized and i'd say a little bit rambunctious rambunctious all right i like that first time me avid car user which is everybody knows 19 above here we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey got what's your name chris nice to meet you so how long have you been smoking me six years [Applause] smacking how often do you like smoke every week what would you say every day i smoke a lot okay so you smoke a lot of kids yes in my lungs origin says at least 93 93 what thc what's your name again matt yeah uh nice to meet you chris how often do you use them uh like cut backs it's like once a day now but it used to be like oh that's cutting back used to be like five times oh [ __ ] so if you were to buy that car or just let's say if you were to sell that car how much would you say it's worth from like zero to 100 like in terms of dollars that's the currency okay if i were to sell it i could sell it for 69. what do you think about the taste crisp clear crisp and clear it's piney you know what like yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it it would be low it would be well worth it batman flavor is high quality i like that i like that i do i like it what do you know about delta a thc nothing nothing nothing okay let's try it and see how you like it yeah alright yeah cool [Applause] so i know it's a big battery don't be too intimidated i gotta just press the button tastes like lemons yeah for sure and this flavor right here i believe is grape so we'll see what her thoughts are on the taste and effects oh it tastes really good actually this easy to taste easy flavor and yeah it gives you relaxedness it tastes like a legitimate car like a legitimate card yeah like an actual cart the terms of stuff that makes it smell yes yes terps give it the smell and taste okay i know that tastes really good okay tastes good smooth for sure smooth yeah so it hit smooth i mean i didn't didn't tickle my throat at all how much is it smacking you right right now i'd say at least 99 percent nine i feel like chill just very like relaxed okay ready to take on the day ready to take on the day well what would you say on a scale like of one to ten how what do you think about the cart taste nine smoothies that's pretty good nice i don't know pretty i mean they're up there if you were to buy that at let's say that dispensary right there how much you think they charge you for it they charge like 80 bucks for stuff like this yeah so if you go to the dispensary there for a point five card it's like a hundred dollars after tax yeah definitely so they're you're definitely getting taxed so with this stuff because it's hemp there's no like marijuana attacks on it so it's a lot cheaper definitely it's nice i would buy it cool right now i want to buy a cart from there you do i don't oh you don't i don't because i want to keep hitting this one right here like i'm good oh [ __ ] like 100 percent hey you see it this first time with delta 8 thc delta 8

see you in the next video you", "cU3_ZwBvf7Q": "hey what's up guys welcome to dev connection and here i got the herb delta 8 thc cartridge now um all what delta 8 really is in a nutshell um is just it's simply a form of cannabinoid right and it still has a similar properties to thc and delta 9 and all that stuff and still delivers good effects you know it's not as strong as regular thc cartridge you get from your dispensary but you can still get really nice effects and it's uh we recently actually reviewed a delta three shy delta thc and those ones actually liked a lot they uh they have a seesaw cartridge hardware so they deliver really good hits and i was surprised with the high right but these are herb a and um taking a closer look i like the packaging a lot like this is pretty cool so it stands the whole time never falls down but i thought it was a c cell right and i realized once i like unscrewed it and everything it is not a c cell this is a it's ceramic coil so that's good but there's no improvements and there's no imprints on the anywhere around it and it's uh i don't know i could just tell the way until it wasn't a c still just by hitting it to be honest because the hardware is not that great it gives really light hits it's uh uh yeah like i said after hitting it i knew um you could tell right away because it just delivers really smooth really soft hits or really light soft hits but um as for the taste i mean the oil is really good it looks really good it's like doesn't move at all the taste is uh here we have two different strains we got chill indica and sweet sativa and uh sweet steve is actually lemon haze that's what i'm actually smoking right now it's uh the taste doesn't deliver that there the cartridge doesn't or this strain doesn't deliver that great flavor to be honest like it says it's lemon haze but i don't know i didn't hear i didn't really get that good of a taste it isn't really i don't know it just kind of takes a little harsh burn and just doesn't really deliver that great taste taste here i'll show you i'ma hit it right now and see show you guys all right yeah so i don't know if you saw that but this uh this cartridge delivers really soft hits and when i pull it when i pull to suck in like smoke it actually feels like i'm pulling kind of hard you know so i didn't like the hardware at all and the cartridge itself it doesn't taste good it tastes burnt to be honest it has a harsh flavor but it has a harsh taste but delta eight is a cannabinoid that is like known to be harsh itself the three-shot delta was pretty harsh but i still like the taste of it way better and they use they actually use sea salt hardware but and like i said the main thing with these cartridges is if they had you see some hardware that'd be so much better because um here's the challenger right it actually broke on me i uh pulled it out this didn't break here right i pulled it out and i already got most of the oil out and um i always hate taking out oil or replacing oil to another cartridge because you'll always lose some oil you'll always lose some oil regardless how good you are at it uh even if it's a little bit but still you know it's like who wants to lose oil you know but it didn't break from here i pulled that part out but right here is where it broke this piece came off i tried pushing it back in and just pushing it as hard as i can but it didn't work i didn't even push it that hard i just you know push it in to see if it would um fit back on and hit but no i didn't work it just i ended up replacing the oil to an actual sea salt cartridge you know and it did hit way better than this and the you know i can't really say anything about this flavor because uh it when i hit it in this thing well the heart was way better right and it still has leftover like flavors from the other cartridge that i had so it gave it tasted a lot more like that you know so but as in regards to the flavors to this strain it didn't deliver that great taste it was harsh it was uh it was just all right effects wise it still delivers good like pretty good effects right like you actually get a pretty nice again a nice uh nice eye right it's not nearly not the same as a regular thc cartridge but at the same time it's a the way i see it personally is like a high or it's like a strong cbd you know it's like strong cbd or a high quality cvd or they're like high quality bait pen that's the way i see it you know but it still delivers great effects uh similar to a regular high not nearly as strong as a cartridge but still nice you know great alternative if you don't have access to thc cartridges or you know if there's a lot of sketchy sketchy brands out there around your area this is a great alternative but this one these ones in particular i wasn't a huge fan of you know i much prefer the three shy delta a thc that one is still harsh right after if you take long hits but it's still i don't know i felt it to be more potent and it was a lot way more tasteful i uh i really hope this one tasted better but i'm not too sure like i said and the taste like just wasn't that good effects were not nearly as strong as the deltae thc but they were still there you know and like i said this is a great alternative if you uh prefer if you are if you're unsure of the cartridges that are around your area if they're pricey like here in illinois cartridges can go for half grams gold for like 60 and a full gram would go for like 80 to 120 you know and that's before taxes the these or maybe you're around an area where all you see sketchy carts are unsure cars that you're just unsure of you know in that case this is better delta a thc is federally legal and legal in most states they'll ship to you and it's just uh something pretty nice to check out if you're like maybe trying to switch up or like you know trying to want something uh reliable something something that trustworthy but more trustworthy than sketchy cards but yeah this is dave connection this is the herb delta athd cartridges and i hope you guys have a great day peace", "q0j7QLS2sJo": "hello cheapest vape supplies calm here just going over a couple of misconceptions in the vape industry regarding blister packaging as you'll see we have two packages here to blister packs we have one off to the left it's a larger opening for a larger cartridge a larger mold I should say it'll hold up to a 1 mil cartridge that's off to the left the other one on to the right is being called a half mil unfortunately that's incorrect there's a lot of misconception in the industry and we're here to alleviate that concern today so right now let's look at the cartridges here we have a point four mil food grade plastic off to the left and we have a point five mil a standard cartridge that's a little bit cloudy or of a plastic so this right here on this 8.5 blister pack and that's not that's not the truth so we're going to a point five cartridge a true 0.5 cartridge 2.5 ml cartridge and we're gonna go ahead and place it inside the blister pack and see what happens okay you see it's all the way down in its slot as far as you can get down there right but if we turn it over a little bit here let's pivot it you'll see that the tip isn't allowed to fit it's hanging up so this is a point five mil cartridge it will not fit in what is being called 0.5 ml blister pack the truth is there is no point 5 molester pack there's a point 4 mil blister pack this is a point 4 ml cartridge right here so we'll take this cartridge we'll take off the point 5 it doesn't fit you can see doesn't fit back and then we'll put the point 4 in there ok as you can see the point 4 fits perfectly like a glove ok now these these are not point pipes there were point for milk our blister packs or 0.3 mil that's what you can fit in these if you want to use a point 5 here you're gonna have to go ahead and use it a 1 mil booster pack that's the only solution I'll hold the 5 mil car 25 ml cartridge or 0.6 mo or a point 8 mil or of course the 1.0 mil um so just to alleviate some concerns today there are no 0.5 ml booster packs there's only 0.4 mil or ones that will fit 0.5 to 1.0 if there's any other questions feel free to reach out to us 708 5 5 7 4 3 5 7 or visit our website at wwlp.com have a great day", "JGS1y4OBROg": "[Music] hey everybody it's brent

doing a quick review or review actually i've already done a review on this vape card but i think this vape card's so good that i need to uh do another review on it um this is probably by far the best vape card i've had i think i explained the journey before um i had got some treetop uh brand uh vape cartridges deltae babe cartridges from uh some three southern vapes in crescent florida however uh my girl had ordered some through uh my site and um uh actually delta direct delta eight on my site um which is the whateverguyshop.com and she got two of these blue dream uh canada river brand um delta ebay cartridges let me tell you something folks this is by far uh the best vape cartridges that i've tried so far um hands down this is this is what it is smoothness texture you can see the consistency of it it's a beautiful color and it's like gold in there it's a really sweet um taste and a really great um motivator um it doesn't lay down or nothing like that it's a as you've seen in my previous videos you'll notice it i've discussed what these parts do what delta 8 is compared to delta 9. delta 9 being the thc that's used most real life uh delta 8 being one molecule or one composition removed and it's not from the butt of the planets from the hemp and it's made federally legal by the 2018 farm act which makes all him drive products legal to sell across the counter so you can go right in the store and buy this if you look at the gas station wanted to sell if they could um again i bought it in two places so far and i think a local place now that i've talked to these people there they're getting get into it um and obviously you can get on my site and check it out to whatever guy shop.com now i want to talk about something else um i bought these two cards for i think 27.99 my girl did um which you know 27 to 28 56 bucks and then whatever she bought two packs of gummy so um i think that site um gives you uh free shipping over a certain amount of money i'm not sure she hit that threshold or not however um they were there in two days now what i want to talk to you about now is the great sale that empire direct is having if you go to my site at

"[Music] hey everyone jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com super excited today back with another west coast weed tour review 2020 edition today the steezy disposable vape pen i got it at the steezy store downtown la this is the disposable thc pen blue dream check it out i'm pretty excited i've never actually hit one of their products before i've tried their dabs i've tried some of their flower but never any other oils so you know i am a big vaper you got those of you who know me know my background know that i'm definitely a vapor it's been that way for a few years uh steezy a super popular brand here in california lots of influencers that part of only the coolest events um on their packaging let's let's go ahead and dive in shall we delta 9 thc is listed 443.57 milligrams total thc 88.71 total cbd this is cool 2.87 milligrams uh manufactured date july 25th packaging date july 25th so relatively fresh still super exciting batch number is listed uid numbers listed manufactured by ironworks collective incorporated that's steezy's license super cool it's got the warnings it says on the ingredients it does just say thc distillate and terpenes it doesn't differentiate which type of terpenes cannabis botanicals live resin who knows um on the back though this is pretty cool uh for many people don't know that i believe this desi has their own technology when it comes to their vaporizing device introducing the new generation of modern thc delivery systems steezy is revolutionizing the cannabis industry by creating a product that offers a discrete experience built for portability and convenience our premium quality concentrates uphold a high level of potency and purity steezy is setting the industry standard to influence and inspire through our innovative methods let's dive in no more [ __ ] here we go oh pull it out ripped it a little bit my bad we got the portable vape oh this is cool check this out it's got its own little battery we've got this beautiful gold oil in there for distillate traditionally a lot of people hate on decilit because it's not the highest quality of concentrates but it is the og of vaping so i'm pretty excited to check that out the stizzy etching and then the california etching there pretty sick all right y'all one hit i'm going to talk about it two hits we'll dive right into the rating system hundred points you guys know the rules west coast we toured let's get it honestly i feel like this little guy here is like the equivalent to the men in black noisy cricket that little battery here rips i was not expecting it to be ripping so uh intensely uh there's definitely an abundance of terpenes it was honestly got a little too hot for me to be able to fully fully like taste them right off the bat but after i blew out all the vape uh or out of you know all the ah it's working it's got me tongue tied i definitely feel like that hit got the job done two hits talk about the ratings here we go all right so this one has me thinking because this is tough you know traditionally i want to be a little bit tougher on distillate because it is not again the best like vaporizing type of concentrate like it it's good for that activity don't get me wrong but it's just not the highest quality so i'm trying to be fair in this keep it real let's go the scores i do like it presentation presentation super cool um well-branded it stands out on the shelf steezy lots of information on this i give them a 10 out of 10 on the presentation they definitely stand out stand out at most stores appeal they do the most to appeal and influence and inspire to the point where it's like you know some people find like what they do annoying myself i think they do set the standard for the proper way to go about it i wish they would diverse their influencers a little bit i would love to see more black brown uh you know varieties of asian people and and other native americans and things like that be utilized but that'll happen when the time comes color we've got a nice golden color there i don't know if you guys can fully see it but there's definitely some good gold color this is some nice looking distillate uh smell yeah you when you can smell the terps through the mouthpiece i think that's a good sign for the vapes for the vape category blue dream i can definitely smell this lemony blueberry there um gosh this is this is good presentation you know 10 out of 10 appeal 10 out of 10 color it definitely looks golden i don't know how this would look better than this 10 out of 10. the smell on this is there 10 out of 10 taste it just says terpenes so again i don't know if these are cannabis terpenes i don't know if these are all natural i don't know if these came from freaking blueberries or candy or whatever um the taste i'm gonna give it a nine just because that uncertainty has to where that tastes come from it does impact me uh potency i was already tongue-tied earlier potency for this it's an 88.71 thc it kind of hit me like a 90-plus got to give them that credit for that potency is there 10 out of 10. experience i'm honestly surprised at how well this hit it smacked me you already saw me [ __ ] up my talking i think it's undeniable that the experience with this is you know around the 9.5 9.25 but it's not because of the actual product here again it comes with the uncertainty i want to know what my ingredients are i want to know what it's actually made with and i want to know how long i'm supposed to hit it for it i could have hit it too long burned it at the beginning and then been too intoxicated initially right and at some point i like to just vape it and go casually and you know potentially be told hit it for five seconds seven seconds etc uh it's being picky but these are real things to think about lots of consumers care about this stuff experience i'm going to give them a 9.25 more information plenty of information available on this would still like some more given that 9.25 again that's kind of the issues i've wanted to be told more would you recommend absolutely 10 out of 10 i would absolutely recommend just because there is some stuff that i have questions about doesn't mean that i wouldn't recommend it perhaps i can find it on instagram send them a dm not sure um they have a large internet presence i would assume they would respond to people overall i feel like i've got to give them for a bit i don't know again if this is canvas terpenes but if this is a botanical terpene device i would give this a 9.5 i might even bump it up to a 9.75 if i find out that this is cannabis terps this gets a 10 out of 10 for bluedream this is incredible steezy has done a great job 100 see why this is such a respected brand and why people like this one of the top sellers um overall like i said you know 9.75 for me i appreciate you guys for all the love check out more of the reviews this blue dream here from steezy california i believe we're going to be reviewing some more products from them in washington so stay tuned follow us on all the socials instagram twitter youtube uh we're all over the place linkedin if you're there networking man please tap in west coast you tour 2020 we'll tap in here soon appreciate you guys for all the love pop some [ __ ] in the comments we'll talk soon peace [Music] you", "X-sukgWh64Y": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] don't watch this video over 18 don't smoke my personal information I hey what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so this video I have another card review for you guys and I actually picked this car door for only $10 $10 and I actually got off my license medical marijuana dispensary so I didn't get it off the street so it's not one of those like bootleg cards going around you know what I mean so it's actually from like at this bench recently I was gonna say I'm like and I actually already smoked one of these already so I kind of know a little bit how like I didn't know what to expect you know what I mean kind of somewhat but but I wanted to get a couple to make videos on for you guys because I tend to orders and if the medical dispensary you know I mean that's kind of like crazy you know I mean and it's actually from the brand dream scheme they're actually they actually have some fire products yeah I actually tried some of their products before um they had some fire products um I seem that they had these for $10 I was I had to pick him up to see what the [ __ ] was good with them you know I mean like what's that was them one thing that's like interesting about them as test it out 40% so that's a little weird you know but I got two strains right here so I'm gonna make two videos on these I got Barry White and Lemon Haze it's for you I'm gonna be baby white I just go over the packaging real quick for you guys just has a dream Steam and then it has this little sticker thing I think this is so like they don't make fakes or something I don't we know what this is for but they each each card comes I get different serial number or whatever you want to call it I don't know I don't know really know why they do that maybe help prevent fakes going around on the bottom assist me and this little bit so side just has the Arizona Department of Health Service for me that's it really other side just has the test results and that's really um that's really all that's on the package of an off so um besides for that you open it up it's games team I believe they use co2 to extract this little it from its Lowry and I mean so it comes in like these like little co2 container I always think it's like dope one parts come in these I don't know why I just think it's cool so it says a premium disloyal dream steam right now yeah dream steam feet calm got so want to look up some more information on them so then just pop this open the one thing that's really [ __ ] weird about these is I'm guessing because it's tested at 40% let me show you maybe read all the ingredients real quick so fertilizer part a no idea what any of that [ __ ] is I don't know just a lot of were [ __ ] and this you guys probably know better than me because a lot of big words you know I mean tell me down below in the comments what you guys think about this I'm not a [ __ ] scientist I don't know what a lot of that [ __ ] is its from harvest of Arizona dot-com right here harvest of AZ up or it'll be somewhere heart it'll be somewhere maybe that's on the description or right here I don't know about to do but harvest of az.com it's like a really big license like professional medical marijuana dispensary in Arizona so that's the reason why I really thought they would sell us some bootleg like we're some [ __ ] [ __ ] oil okay I think they would get sued real fast yes it's a it's a medical dispensary it's not a recreational shop so the thing I found really interesting about these cards is the [ __ ] of consistency of them this [ __ ] is like like almost like water like now it's thicker than water but obviously but like let me show you guys a little bit weird [Music] you see what I'm saying that [ __ ] it's super liquidy but it's just tested at 40% so I mean I don't really expect it to be like not moving and I mean it's 140 percent well I already smoked one of these but like I'm low-key like scare this one more she's like what the [ __ ] is the other 60% like I don't know that [ __ ] is weird it better be something safe coming down below in the comments what you guys think of these because they're selling them at the medical marijuana [Music] it also has them give you call these tips so I'm just gonna put this on my basic pen they like make many of these different what I mean this is actually can dispense we call it sky and I don't know I like to spend a lot even though it's kind of generic so on the pen this is what it looks like very white that's the strain or flavor what I want to call it obviously it's not me would like at least I don't think it'd be made with like some quality Terps since probably me wasn't she church it's just something for this price but um I don't know it's just going for the first hit kind of scary pray for me because I smoke along I hope you smoking some better [ __ ] than I am and it's off the bat like it has a really weird flavor to it like definitely doesn't a sexist ran Barry White oh I don't know just tastes like that I mean it's only forty percent THC and then sixty percent whatever so obviously less sixty percent is gonna overload that forty percent in immunity so I kind of just tastes like a bunch like mix it like a bunch of chemicals to be honest what kind of with a little bit of marijuana in there like not the worst flavor because I've had this taste in ugly parts before that I don't buy cars from the street I only buy my cards from dispensaries I think there was only one two times I bought two carts I bought off the street I think um it was the off worth car and the bank's cart I have two videos on those and I mean I pretty much bought them just to make the videos on and they don't pretty good so I don't regret it so these $10 carts are a little [ __ ] weirdos like I just really want to know just like your guys's opinion okay I got this at the medical shop like I say so very white it's been the [ __ ] beer though but it's put the clarity perfect taste is not the price point though ten bucks want the work they were ranked there originally twenty bucks I wouldn't pay 20 bucks for these [ __ ] no I'm not paying a 20 bucks for this but they had like a sale 50% off so they're ten bucks that's the only reason I bought them ten bucks I mean I could see that I could see people buying these for ten bucks to get rid of those eight cards off the street you know what I mean I'll grab the smoke one of these and those fake cards but this is still [ __ ] weird like I wouldn't pay 20 bucks or ten bucks I'm still like kinda iffy about it you know what I mean but it's ten dollars and something to smoke on all day you know what I mean ten bucks you bought weed it's gonna make like one blunt that's one size you know what I mean this is something like you can literally hit all day I just want to know if it was owned other chemicals I don't know none of that [ __ ] is so if you guys just tell me what you guys think of it down below in the comments I'm really curious to know what you guys think of it I made this a couple more times real quick now these hearts are definitely strange they definitely blow clouds or as you can see they don't taste the best in the cart that I smoked before I opened this one was actually better white to society so I'm definitely interested to see what this Lemon Haze one tastes like I'm gonna make the video right after I'm done recording this video so look out for that video it's pretty much the same thing test it at 40% but yeah if you guys want to see that video beaten the lookout for that definitely have some more fire cards to review for you guys um so yeah I got some more select parts to review for you guys I got real rule number for strawberry cheesecake and great white shark and to be honest I only got this one just present name or chart what that [ __ ] kind of name is that for I don't know you know what I mean so these are actually seventy [ __ ] dollars for a car which is ridiculous but they're [ __ ] fire so I have a couple reviews up on them like pineapple Express wedding cake I think I might have one more I forget you can go check those out if you want and look out for those this card sorry I kind of like it a lot of talking right there in the middle but this quarter like I don't know I don't know what I think about it but it's alright but it's not the best I honestly don't even feel like I'm any higher like the one I started making this video when I hit it a million times yeah I don't know on a scale of one to five fi the rate this cargo taste the flavor let me give it up I really don't want to give it a one someone to give the to the flavors the flavors not there at all but it's not the worst taste and maybe not a - yeah maybe like a two and a half because this definitely has to be some more like worst tasting cars out there than this I'll make it like a two and a half it just tastes kind of weird you know what I mean I don't know you're not explaining it yet just taste it for yourself the high two out of five again it's not there the way it smokes the ways I'm going cloud five out of five [Music] it's like a ten-dollar cars to smoke all day long you know what I mean can't really complain her coat wrong with that that's gonna dope so something the smoke on puffs on all day long my overall score on the [ __ ] dogs in the background going crazy I don't know if he hear that my grandma but my overall score in this I'm gonna give it like oh I'm gonna go to three out of five just because the price point I got on for 10 bucks I would not pay 20 bucks for them but 10 bucks for this car it's something to smoke on all day long but for you guys out there that know what those other chemicals are that in there and we don't blow in the comments with the artists oh I know I'm smoking um be on the lookout for those other videos like I said um yeah so time we don't blow in the comments you guys have any other like video ideas or complet anything doesn't gonna tell me I'll read every single comment and I guess besides for that you guys like the videos were the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] you know what to do and it's been around already so", "5t-gmr0Opa0": "[Music] hey what's good youtube it's your boy cbd smoke doctor i am back with another review finally so i got a device here that i got

but i'll be back with another review soon guys peace", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "IwFl5_mHx5E": "[Music] what is going on welcome back to the icemoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be taking a look at two new flavors of the goods disposable distillate vape pens if you've been watching the channel you would have seen my review of the grape ape last month and boy did i enjoy it there are two new flavors out this month straw nana and blue dream both of which i really enjoy anyway so i am going to try these out in the video today and let you know my thoughts so if you want to get your hands on any of the goods distillate vape pens you can do so on the hemphealth website they retail at 19 pounds 99 however at time of filming they're on offer for 15 pounds you can even use the discount code i smoke 10 for 10 off let's take a quick look at the packaging that they came in so the box says ingredients broad spectrum cbd distillate and terpenes instructions for use our vapes are auto draw activated simply take slow smooth drags until the desired effect is reached do not exceed 70mg cbd a day must be 18 plus to use this product good manufacturing process certified gmp big thanks to the goods for sending these over for me to have a look at today they come in the same packaging that the grape flavour does that the maui wowie flavor does with the package that you peel open to ensure freshness inside this little box inside we have the vape pen which looks like this and it's actually a proprietary vape pen it's not using a c cell cartridge but rather is using their own device in this pen is 45 cbd distiller in this case flavored with blue dream and in this case flavoured with straw nana this is part of their hustle range which is for the daytime and this is part of their chill range which is for the evening although being a cannabis consumer i tend to just consume them whenever i want that flavor profile and with great results as well each of these will deliver up to 300 puffs but that is going to completely depend on how big your puffs are you can treat this more like a dab pen and do some quite big puffs and get some quite big clouds with it or you can sip it and it will last longer they don't actually have a charging port because they are single use you just use it until it runs out and actually you never need to worry about charging it worth mentioning obviously as a disposable product in 2020 it's not as eco-friendly as something that you would use again and again but they tend to last quite a while and i'm still only using my second or third pen so i'm not creating a lot of waste with it so what i'm going to do now is try out both of these flavors and let you know my thoughts starting with the blue dream here we go oh that's got a nice flavor profile to it so it's kind of sweet blue and berries like all together as one literally no hemp taste at all it's just pure terpenes and that is very very nice blue dream is actually up there on my list of cannabis strains the distillate delivers a really nice turpee flavor although it's not going to taste like if you were smoking blue dream in a bong for example i'm impressed with that really easy to vape as you can see you don't need to press any buttons hold it to your lips and inhale let's take a look at the straw nana flavor profile which looks very similar it's the same device but it has a different logo printed on it this is a really cool thing about the goods range say you had different flavors just sitting there on your desk you can flip them over and see which flavor is which very easily you're not going to get mixed up not that you would once you've tasted them anyway but the the color code and the little icon on the back is really handy in that regard looking at the straw 9r1 i could actually smell this when i opened it and i was like really excited just from opening it out of the packet and getting that terpy aroma i'm going to taste it now oh that is the terpest of them all that is strawberry and banana and the blue turp and yeah mercene all the nice ones that that go into um like the sort of sweet good sex tracks i think leaves a lovely sort of taste on the inside of my lips there and it's really present during the exhale as well really can taste it as i'm breathing it out lovely straw nana really really good indeed which do i prefer out of the two that's an interesting one i did this with the grey paper and the maui wowie and the grey paper came out on top when i'm trying to pick between the blue dream and the straw nana i'm leaning towards the straw nana because the flavor profile is just so distinguishable you can smell it you can smell strawberries and bananas you can taste strawberries and bananas both of them deliver a really nice smooth vaping experience but this one has got a really deserty kind of feel to it which i really like so do i think this is a good product and how do i think it compares to other stuff on the market personally i'm not vaping c cell devices anymore i'm just vaping these distillate pens from the goods i didn't vape a lot of vape pens anyway but these deliver a really nice responsive result and a really nice flavor as well so i've just found myself vaping these i also think they're worth it as a product on their own merit because 20 pounds for a single use vape pen that's going to actually last you quite a while and give you regular hits of cannabidiol i think is quite a good deal when you factor in how good it tastes it does make it a really easy decision for me and i will certainly be getting some more when this runs out but if you are really stuck for flavor profiles and you can't pick between them then go with the straw nana or go with the grape ape in my opinion you will not be disappointed one thing i wanted to try was just trying out these flavor profiles together just to see what they taste like blue nana or straw dream it's a nice combination guys what do you think of this video have you tried any of the good disposable vape pens from the hemphealth website do leave your comments below let me know your favorite terpene profiles and i will catch up with you in another video in 2021 folks thank you so much for watching it has been an absolute pleasure this

which carts are available and how much and how to smoke them the right way what their prices are so stay dialed in if you leave you're just going to spend more trying to find the right cbd the right dosages so stay clicked in go down on the bottom click that subscribe button so you don't miss my videos my content uh i don't want anything all i want to do is see a smile on everyone's face there's tons of natural products that we we could all use uh whether it's sleep um anxiety stress uh pains epilepsy there's uh autism so let's stay on the subject let me show you uh by starting out with the tinkatures that are available in unflavored cbd so these are the delta eights that i spoke about in the last program actually only one of them is this one the 500 milligram delta eight by creating better days it's an incredible delta a product that you could use by just squeezing the dropper getting a full dropper about an hour before you go to bed because it takes some time to kick in and this will help you sleep through the entire night the price range uh for these tinkeaters that i'm going to be talking about both flavored and unflavored are 50 to 70 so not a lot for a great product that i vetted and i take and i know it works and retailers professionals whether they're sport and medicine doctors that are also on board of retail shops that are using them and selling them like health food shops that are uh in alliance with us are seeing and getting great feedback from customers that are looking for products to help them sleep through the whole night uh they have four or five hours like me that they could sleep they have a tremendous day ahead of them and they can't risk you know crappy sleep and they just don't want to take the synthetic ambience and whatever else there is available for you that makes you groggy so another thing to talk about is these things don't make you groggy they have no flavor they could be added to salads being that they're flavorless beverages as well whether it's a tea or a coffee so the new bottle is a thousand milligrams so it's double the strength and from fifty dollars to seventy dollars for only twenty dollars or more you get double the strength so if you were taking two droppers like i was uh because i have a high tolerance of the 500 you can now only take one and one bottle lasts you for the entire month now i'm going to talk about because we covered the dosages we covered the flavors um and the pricing the flavored uh tinkatures what's available in the flavored i did show you in the last video the mango and the strawberry shortcake these are 600 milligrams and i love these i know uh comes the nighttime hour before i take my delta eight uh if it's just flavored and i'm not adding it to the beverage like the other one i just showed you i know i'm gonna sleep the whole night so and i know whoever i give this to is gonna enjoy their sleep their whole night so these are also great products in that 70 price range as well but remember if you did subscribe uh to my channel you could then go use the code youtube sub on the site and get 20 off anything you buy one everything one time or all the time so remember to subscribe and use that code youtube sub uh at checkout for your 20 off at tinkeature make sure you shake up the tinkature before you take it and it's got that child seal so you're gonna have to push it down make sure when you pinch and you fill it up with oil that um you'll see it's only half so when i say take a full dropper i mean a full dropper so if you only got half make sure to take another half all right just making sure we're all on the same page now we're going to go to the fun category which is gummies and quite a few have been added since the last video just like in the oils the last video what we did is we went over the gummies the blueberry raspberry rings that are 25 milligrams each there's a 10 uh piece or 20 piece so 250 milligrams is 10 pieces obviously and the 500 is 20. these are great products they do take a little bit more time to kick in i'm going to open them up and show them to you so one of these blueberry uh delta eight rings is 25 milligrams uh you take it about uh two hours before um you know takes a little time to kick in some people say one to two for me it's almost two hours so that's why i say two hours allow some time for it to uh kick in um price range so these are only 30 for the 10 piece and 45 dollars only 15 dollars more you get double the quantity so there's your layup shot if you want to try it for 30 dollars and then you're sold on it and you love it you can get some value right there by doing just what i said another important thing about these guys is they're vegan so they use a plant-based binding material as opposed to gelatin which is the next set of gummies that i'm going to talk about that are delta eight so i hope you got all the information on the pricing and the dosages just to go over again is one of these to two of these if you have a high tolerance like me it's two if not you're fine with one uh take it about two hours before and you should be good to go all of these are on the site in the delta eight section the next one i'm going to talk about is sun state this is 30 piece 300 or 600 milligram gummies and they come in two different sizes 300 milligram or 600 milligram and each bottle has totally different flavors so the one that we did last month was a delta eight sun state 300 milligram which had great flavors blueberry mango and watermelon and all of the tastes of these cubes um like i said are amazing the the second you put this thing on your tongue you start salivating so these little cubes come in those three different flavors that i told you and moving on to the double strength 600 milligram which puts you at 20 milligrams a piece to the 10 milligrams a piece you have different flavors so the flavors here are strawberry grape and passion fruit which is by far my favorite flavor uh in anything i don't know if it's yours but it's definitely mine um these are the feedback we get on these 20 milligrams is that they're more potent taking one of these than taking two of these gummies so you could actually buy the 600 milligram and cut it in half and that should be good to get you to sleep um pricing these are now 300 milligrams are down to 42 bucks from the 60 70 dollar area if not more depending on where you're going and on the delta 8 600s they're down to where the three hundreds were in that 69 area so if you want to pick up really potent gummies that are excellent and do the job to get you to sleep and stay asleep uh these are them the flavors are amazing there's 30 count in each of these bottles and it's definitely something to write on your list as a keeper oh yeah the professor's here so let's get this program started dosages for the delta 8. each little cube they have those three different flavors uh the mango the blueberry and the watermelon and in the 600 milligram you have the passion fruit the grape and the strawberry so those you could cut in half again if you wanted to see those little cubes they're easy to slice in half and very effective so these delta eights are 10 milligrams you could take two to three of these to go to bed so moving on to the carts that are available there's quite a few we're going to start off with the creating better days 500 milligram cart and these will require that you go out and buy a pen however if you shop with me on my site anytime you buy your delta 8 carts i'm going to do a special promo where i send you a free battery that you could use with your carts so there's a ton of different carts different flavors that i'm going to talk about that are delta 8 right now but first i want to show you how to use them so you could use a standard 510 pen any one of them will do the trick just take your cart right out of the packaging and get it ready to screw onto your battery screw it on press your battery five times to get it on and then you'll hold down inhale and hold it in for at least three seconds and when you exhale wait about 20 minutes before you take another hit these things are strong they're potent because you're inhaling them they get right into your system right to work and you should feel relaxed right away so the flavors that i'm going to go over now that you know how to use your vape pen and the proper dosage are um well let's start with this one this one doesn't have uh flavor so if you don't want to have that overpowering um candyish perfumey taste not that the other ones have that then this is this is the item for you creating better day's 500 milligram uh nano delta cbd very strong very good and you can get it for only 55 bucks it's 1 ml so it's a full tank it's a quality tank and you're going to enjoy the benefits from this product okay so sun state you're going to be uh looking at a couple of fun flavors like apple fritter blue dream um i think i messed up with the color looking it on the screen sour diesel blue dream apple fritter banana kush and a strawberry lemonade so those are five sick flavor carts that are amazing delicious and uh they work great so i hope you loved this program i hope you're gonna stay tuned into my channel the next program i'm going to put out is a special all about sleep products every single thing you could tape take for sleeping in cbd whether they're capsules or their gummies or other products so if you want to find out you've got to subscribe have a great day happy 21. [Music] so you", "xhICd92Z8Xo": "guys this is Florida MJ 4:20 here I'm a medical patient in the state of Florida and today's video is about the pocket cartridge guess that's what you call it's a oil cartridge these are I'm not sure how long they've been out but they were having this great sale where you you just pay shipping and you get them for free and I love this thing okay this is my favorite I like these way better than sea cells they don't clog as much but there's a problem that I just discovered today take a close look and what you'll see is do you see that right there that blue do you see that blue speck up inside of there okay let's find some more there's a blue speck right inside of this hole it's getting sucked into the cartridge it's getting sucked into the ceramic wick let's see how many more we find here's one I don't know if I recorded that one is this one it's hard to keep this at the right angle and in the light that one looks clear here's an aspect right there you see it so at first I noticed I was getting some harsh hits and I was like what's up with my fake what's going on with it and then I looked I noticed these blue things and I'm like what in the world is that and then I realize it's from these gaskets they don't work I mean they're not they can't stand up to this so I've used C cells for like well over a year and I've never had this problem with them so this is a simple problem that you should be able to fix you know this company exactly what the parent company is hopefully you can see this but see look do you see that it's shredded just screwing this thing back together shreds the gaskets and it puts it into your vapor I've now ruined a whole tank almost half a tank but you know I've now ruined all of this stuff it's got plastic or whatever this is all up inside of my distillate now so I can't use this you see I don't want to smoke this blue plastic or whatever it is and let me see you I'm gonna it looks like it's just like I don't know it's disintegrating almost and this is just dispensary distillate this is legal dispensary distillate from true leaf okay this is not some kind of black market stuff that's you know all weird and eaten everything alive because of how crazy it is I mean so pocket man I was I was looking to go over to your cartridges 100% because I your design you have a better design and I'm not gonna say why until I do the review on these after hopefully you fixed them but you'd have a better design it doesn't clog as much so please fix this problem and if you got if you got a pocket cartridge out there right now I think you need to tape pay close attention to what you're vaping and make sure that you don't have a bunch of silicon rubber or what that stuff is clogging up your holes and it's not just clogging I mean it's going inside there see if we can get this see is inside the hole it's getting sucked in there when I first looked there were a bunch more around these holes that I don't see anymore because what happened was I went out to eat and I noticed this when we sat down and then as we're eating I completely forgot and I took a couple of Apes when we went out to the car and I probably sucked some up in there because there were a bunch more down the hood by these holes but what is that I count at five five little chunks of silicone come on there look in that hole that's what that's about to be vaped and this one I'm not sure what's in this hole it could be more it's probably more of the plastic but it looks obstructed and it has a little bubble stuck in it doesn't look like the other ones at all and see even this one has a bubble but it's clear this one on the other hand looks like it's got a chunk in it or something all right well thanks for watching and I hope they fix this problem because it's a good product otherwise have a good one", "qL-WBjAQYjk": "[Music] hey [Music] what's going on guys tony robb here back from another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day um if my voice and my articulation is a little messed up well that's because i just got my wisdom teeth removed a few hours ago like maybe a little over 10 hours ago and my mouth is a little bit swollen and that's not gonna stop me from making a youtube video and like i always do i push through and yeah so i hope you guys are going to enjoy this video because this is going to be a review yeah let's get it started all right what we have here today is a wax pen you know with cartridges thc and all that good stuff i didn't even open it i bought this from a local dispensary it's from the company good supply um this is a indica strain it has 880 808.76 milligrams of thc um there's a little bit less than five milligrams of cbd and a little less than a total of seven milligrams in the whole thing of cbd um it weighs about 0.5 grams it was packaged the 24th of march 2020 and yeah without further ado let's open up the packet and i was gonna use my mouth to open up this packet but i will not um yeah i can't wait to use this i bought it specifically because i was gonna get operated and i could not smoke and i know that vaping it isn't better than just regularly smoking it but i prefer to try to inhale the cleanest smoke possible so i don't get it infected some of my friends smoke backwards the day of their operation nothing happened but i prefer not to take the risk because i'm an unlucky person we have the good supply this pack cost me 58 it comes with the cartridge which is blue dream and it comes with the good supply vaporizer battery pack so it comes with included comes with a battery usb charger a usb chargeable it's 4 000 it's 400 milliamp hours three available temperatures standard 500 510 thread include yes and here it is yep this is what it looks like this is the packaging and this is what the thc box looks like so i'm gonna open it up and is this it um that's how you open up the box i don't feel like ruining the box wait oh okay i guess it opens up like this what is this right here like what does this do absolutely nothing okay okay so this whole box wow you could smell it through the cartridge that's sick damn smells like kind of smells actually the actual blue dream not even gonna lie with you about that so this is the cartridge this looks like a regular thc cartridge and we all know it's not fake so here we have the box and we have user instructions so i'll keep it here and i'll focus it and i'll read the instructions usage charge battery before use turn 510 threaded cartridge clockwise onto battery do not over tighten push button rapidly five times to turn on off led light will flash when batteries turn on off push button rapidly three times to alternate between three heating settings preheating push button rapidly two times no led will change colors push button one time to quit preheating when ready to use press and hold the button inhale

charge storage conditions store in a cool dry place between 4 and 30 degrees celsius troubleshooting cartridge connectivity issues button will will flash red remove cartridge and re attach tightly low battery indication led will flash 10 times charge battery usb provided restrict the airflow clog preheat for five seconds before vaping all right so here we have this baby right here so yeah my bad for the cut the audio software just stopped recording so i had to restart it but at least i got the supply pack charged so this comes with the battery pack right here this beautiful baby right here i charged it up you need to charge it before using it but at least the audio cutting helped me charge it up then you have the specific charger just like joule they're trying to make you not use a regular old charger they want you to use the specific charger you gotta screw it on and then you can charge it to tell if it is fully charged this thing is gonna turn green and this thing is gonna turn green so that's what happened it turned green and yeah i got it fully charged so without further ado let's uh get it started i'm gonna take one puff one puff only i'm not gonna puff it too much i'm not gonna start [ __ ] around with the smoke in my mouth because as i just said previously i just got my mouth operated so [ __ ] that i'm not gonna risk having an infection so yeah what we have here uh i need the instructions actually i'll keep the instructions in front of me so that way i don't mess up so here we have the pod the wax pod i'm gonna take off this cap right here come on baby yes sir got that cap off and let's screw it on they said not too tight it's not too tight and let's remove this over here and here we have it the blue dream distillate yes sir so with the blue dream this lit how do you turn it on push rapidly five times turn it on so one two three four five it's on no led will flash when batteries turn on press rapidly press button rapidly three times to alternate between three heating static settings one two three it just flashed blue uh one two three now it's red one two three now it's white okay um what are the colors like what's the the the you know the the chart the color chart um preheating rapidly twice okay one two so this is the preheating okay okay [ __ ] it so i'll take a puff okay that was one puff i'll take a second one hmm tasted actually fairly good didn't hurt too much my uh my molar my wisdom tooth area whatever so this thing actually gives me decent size drags actually wow and yeah so i'm gonna turn it off so i got my three four puffs in so another one last one all right so turn it off how do i turn it off press rapidly five times so one two three four five so is that it one two three four five one two three four five nothing i so i think it's off turn this off got the cartridge off so i had a little piece here i'll keep that protected and i'll put this on top of the cartridge so i can protect the cartridge and um i'll try to keep it standing up so i can prevent the hc from spilling over so my thoughts i can already feel the buzz coming in it's obviously a wax so it's a little stronger airflow was good it didn't feel like those cheap ass uh vapes has a good cartridge the battery is good the only downside i think is the charger the the screw-on charger i guess that's new i just lost the screw-on charger so you're pretty much screwed losing the screw-on charger if you lose it because um i don't know where the hell you can buy this except from a cannabis store or online on amazon but yeah make sure not to lose your screw-on charger make sure not to lose the cartridges the lady at the dispensary told me you can keep it pretty much anywhere in your pocket whatever i don't trust that hole so i'm gonna keep it somewhere warm and tidy so it doesn't melt or it does not uh lose its potency i'm gonna keep this somewhere safe too and overall good product seven out of ten if i would give it a number uh it was decently expensive the cartridges aren't expensive i think it's just the battery pack and the starter kit that's expensive um the vaporizer got me high i feel a little higher and a lot more elevated than i was a few mil a few moments ago obviously the whole product is good uh like i said seven out of ten pick it up if you want something discreet and that will let you get high on the low low um yeah that's pretty much it i don't have much to say about this product more than this gets you high gets the job done good ass blue dream i can't taste the blue dream that much and the high i guess reflects the blue dream high but not too much because it's a distillate in wax so it's a little stronger it's a sharper buzz but yeah if you guys enjoyed this video drop a like and hit

"hey guys is Deb connection we're gonna be going over how to refill the spark cartridge by Pocket vapor I gotta say really love this cartridge one thing I really like about it is well you can just keep refilling it and it doesn't get all clogged II which I've noticed a lot of other cartridges they give clogging pretty quick after about a gram and a half so first what you can do is unscrew that top okay so you got the top unscrewed here just like any other cartridge and I have my oil here I always want the oil through hot water in the glass of course before I fill and that makes it so it comes out nice and easy now I'm tight okay and then the spark cartridge just gonna fill right in there nice thick glass and the spark cartridge is gonna be coming in this there's gonna be a half gram version and see there we go but this one's about a point eight which I love because you really want to wait for your half Ram to be able to refill it you can just fill it out and what I do is I always spread it around spread it around [Music] there we go spread it around [Music] I kind of try to force it so it goes down in there and I wipe off the side they go yeah just gonna fill that just push that all the way in get a nice fill there BAM okay now sometimes you'll see there's a little bit up well around that top area what I'll do to expedite that it's falling down as well as do a little a little bit of heat just a tiny bit heat and then I'll let the thing sit and actually I like to let it sit inside the actual pockemon battery because it just sit sit up nice and perfect so now that's done it's gonna screw that back on top make sure it's really tight there's no gap you're gonna feel how great quality as cartridge is when you fill it up it's a really nice thick metal and then yeah now I'm just gonna let it sit in there so and then sitting there for a while I want to expedite the oil going down a little bit I might blow this on a hair dryer for a little while this one already had some oil in it so it's okay to hit if you have not put any oil in this yet you might want to let this sit for like half an hour maybe stuck on a little bit do a couple dry poles before you start it up and you just want to make sure that the coat the cotton is getting I mean the cotton on the inside is soaking up the oil and at this point pop it in let it sit and about a half-hour to start it after you do a little dry hit and that's how you fill a pocket one spark or pocket ones or pocket paper spark cartridge whatever you want to call it I've gotta say a really awesome quality cartridge I'm gonna be doing another review on this on the cartridge itself great quality product thanks for watching guys is Dan connection and have a great week", "0S9lQJf3BXM": "yo what's pop and welcome back to boss man bosco today i'm gonna be reviewing the kind pen it's a little battery for the cards give you a usb charger next to the pen check it out looks like a pen and today the part i'm gonna

tested and they produce the same relaxation anti-nausea and pain relief effects associated with indica strains without the paranoia associated with a lot of sativa strength we've combined the highest

texasthc.be", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

the grass skirt lounge coming back at you guys with a new fake cartridge review now shout out to my homies the the the grass ninjas of course you know that's who I go to to get most of my supplies but material things like that shaking or less [ __ ] from you know saying they got a pretty big operation and when they allow me to tell tell you more I will but we'll be doing right now on amber industries that is the company that makes these these vape cartridges - amber industries and I was I was chillin with my homeboy yesterday in gardenia and cuz I went and bought some more so for all of those who are curious we do have fave cartridges for sale now and yes I'm outside guys I'm actually at the shop getting um some breaks put on my car cuz they [ __ ] horrible but um but yeah hammer industries now from what I hear that like though like one of the top brands for vaping I mean I think they even over brass knuckle right now so and what I got is I mean that they're they're very conscious I mean that vape cartridges are pretty good um it never from what I've seen like they're not like real overwhelmingly strong you know Plus this vape and I have - you can change the voltage on it so it burns at a at a different rate depending on the setting that you have been on green red or blue the red setting is the lowest voltage then there's the green and then blue obviously being the highest in ascending order but um this is Africa by amber industries and this is um I believe that Africa is a sativa cuz it definitely [ __ ] it's like a sativa it's good - Matt it's real good I didn't I'm so what we have available now you know I'm not gonna rattle off randomly but I think we have I know we got some gorilla glue we got a gorilla glue vapes now also so you guys could definitely check us out on that but um just a quick little update I will post another video with the arm with there from flavors that we have available now as well but I do highly recommend the amber industries not least because you know the homies that the of my homies of grass ninjas put me down with these but I'm simply because they I mean they're good cartridges you know if you're looking to you know have something that you can you can smoke on throughout the course of the day and now I get to [ __ ] get to tree like cuz for me you know I'm you know I'm doing [ __ ] throughout the day and I don't necessarily hold on it's a lot of traffic behind me hold on yes oh my bad for that guys I am outside doing this and where I am it's a lot of [ __ ] trucking companies and [ __ ] so you might get a lot of that background noise my bad for that but uh I'll try not to make the video so long it's a nice subject subject you guys to whole bunch of irritating noises but anyway where was I what was I saying um yes so like that like this F cool fencing this is a good sativa hi man I mean it's not it's not it's not one of those drowsy indica you know couch lock highs you have you sink into the [ __ ] center of the earth I mean this is a good highway you can function throughout the day I make you smoke it you get blazed I mean you take too big a hit your gag you know what I'm saying but you can smoke it throughout the day and still function and get that nice mental high you know as opposed to the physical high you can still accomplish it so the a school was definitely good for that man I'm liking this I haven't stopped smoking this [ __ ] since I got it on last week yes I had this since what last week was the last time I went down to gardenia he dropped some I dropped some edibles off so I've been smoking on this half gram jump off for for for for yeah for about a week or so and I still got maybe four three four more days left on this if I hit it consistently maybe two but yeah man so check out um SQ like your local dispensary or whoever is your your vape or cannabis supplier about amber industry of vape cartridges they are definitely on the come up man um let's see if they last cuz remember the last the let I did a review on the low highs arm and what I want to put I'm not gonna put my business out there but um they haven't came correct so their products aren't being held by the grass by my homies that the grass ninjas but anyway uh uh this is the the a school this is pretty decent it's a sativa you know and it does exactly what you expect us ateva to do this is my this is my this is my daytime high you know what I'm saying when the night goes down and I'm chilling of course you know I've rolled up a vegan rat and I do some other things maybe one day I'll break down you know my process to roll it rolling my raps and you know what I what I do because it is a process but anyway that's all I got for now and guys um thanks for tuning in shout out to all

channel talker's notes where i take tokes and you take notes today my friends we have a lovely lovely selection here from i spire this is their dual core vape cartridge uh setup with the batteries and then the cartridges these are the half grams full gram full gram half gram so there's half gram and full gram cartridges we're going to get into details about what makes these cartridges different than any other vape cartridge on the market today but first i wanted to show you guys just how to fill them up so let me just take these out first let me show you we will be filling it up with jetty extracts you see that this is the debricator so it's like a syringe used for free filling your vapes so you don't get no crummy street brand vapes or anything like that you can fill up your own vapes with some high quality oil and uh really really get yourself going there so let's go ahead and open the jetties up so you guys can see what i'm talking about this is my first time actually doing one of these so let's see how we're gonna crack this open because it's child proof and you know i'm basically a child all right there we go there we go take that sticker off right there and now let me see there we go so it has these two dots here so check it out you pull here and you push these two dots in as a child safety mechanism and that's what allows you to open it up so that is our debicator pen right there let's pull that thing out i don't think there's nothing else in there for us to close that up and this is the applicator pen with your nice dab juice in there it looks like it had maybe a little bit of leakage not exactly sure how you use this but uh you know we will be giving it a shot so i see like let's see how this works so do you take this tip off you have it so you have really really nice uh like a metal tip in the front that allows you to put your oil in smoothly so let's go ahead and get one of these cartridges ready so we're going to do this and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to flip the camera around so that you can get a nice clear shot of this happening okay so this is the i spire half gram dual core cartridge and uh we'll get into the specifics of the tech in this just a minute first we're gonna we have to fill this up and then we have to let it sit overnight it's like it really really settle in and uh that's what we're gonna do now we're just gonna fill them up and then we'll come back on this video and really really get into detail about what's going on here as you can see it's definitely something different it has the air valve you can control the airflow see that core center it's a little different so you just remove this top like this see this it has a nice seal so that reveals your inner core mechanism and uh your with a space where you're gonna put your oil that's what we're gonna do right now we'll take this see how this is actually done because i'm not sure let me see okay there it is it's a little pan yes it's not so easy let me just put this here see that helped me get a better grip on things so yeah it's not super simple to do so i guess that's why you have to let it sit overnight to let that oil run down in there but it's going let's get a little bit more in there there we go now we got a nice amount of oil dripping down in there we'll save the rest of this pen in fact we're going to do a nice the full brand one too so this way we get a full solid review on everything let's go ahead and unwrap that stand that up right there i don't want that spilling yes all right hold on we're just trying to find a safe spot for the pen okay this is the full gram vape let's take off the protective plastics you see the oil all over the gloves i already knew that was gonna happen that's why i'm wearing gloves see the same thing with the airflow right you got there same thing right here just remove this top place that one there you have a good look at that one more time i'm getting it all sticky on the outside now all right so let's grab our pen let's do the same thing here and jam that in there just to give us a little bit more stabilization when it comes to dripping this oil in all right so there we go just gotta be careful putting it right there i don't want to be all covering the camera sorry here we go i'm getting a little better at it yes it was my first time it's not as hard as i thought it would be i just didn't know what i was getting myself into but now look at that it's pretty simple i'm gonna squeeze out a little bit more this is some good oil too you can see it's gotta be tasty all right there all right let's let that drip down and let me show you the other one it pretty much drip down all the way real nice so check that out let's give you guys a good view of that so that's nice and filled in there and we're going to do is go ahead and put the top back on that you screw that on real nice and tight and that's on there nice and tight you see that good color oil no street [ __ ] or cheap watered down crap good jelly extract right in there so we're gonna let that sit as recommended overnight and uh you know let's see uh tomorrow we get up we attach the batteries and we talk some tech peace right guys now that we're back and everything has had an opportunity to sit and you know get get all settled in there so we got our cartridges are nice and filled up and ready to go and then uh these are the ispire batteries this is their pen style battery here and and i have it all sticky because i've been using it i've actually been using it um i've been smoking a lot of the half gram cartridge um this is their palm battery here both are really really really cool i want to talk to you a little bit about this uh pen style battery now this is actually the the founder of i spire tony liu invented the bottom vertical coil style used in every cartridge in the world he's the inventor of that he also invented the cloud vape coils that the e-cigs use now too so this guy has been in the business for a while so he knows what he's talking about so when he says that something is new and he's excited to talk about it this has got to be the thing man so yeah we're excited to to be able to review something from somebody so noticeable all right so the battery itself is shorter and wider batter battery than a traditional vape battery benefits looks sexier than a traditional setup and less likely to snap because of a grippy wide diameter so it is kind of thick and there's a good feeling in your hands i like it people who like vapes and like pen style vapes this is a very very nice battery from i spy um it feels and looks what's familiar but better like you know it does have the the familiar pen feel but it is thicker and stronger and it does have that like you know upgraded feel to it so it is really really nice all right three part three power settings turn power down for light hits and crank power up for powerful hits so you know you click three times and it'll switch uh power modes most likely that's how most these pens work electronically safe protection i guess it won't blow up because it's it's put together in such a way that it'll uh you know it cuts off on its own so if the button hits in your pocket it just it won't over burn and just melt and destroy itself in your pocket so you don't have to worry about stuff like that uh it says a 350 milliamp battery one charge lasts longer than a cartridge does so yeah that's something that we would like to definitely put to the test but um yeah i could see myself killing a cartridge i actually did i've had that half gram cartridge filled up and i've already pretty much smoked through that thing just to give this a nice test and let everybody know exactly how i feel about the product so you know i had to really really beat it up so yeah i pretty much killed that cartridge and have not i actually have not even charged this is i've been using it with the power it came with the whatever the power had in there when they send it that's what i've been using and it's still going so i guess that's pretty good um more about the dual core vape cartridges this right here let's see if we can get a little zoom in on that so you guys can see you know i do have this a little bit dirty because i've got wax all on the outside but um yeah so let me see what it says here about these cartridges so we have the half gram of the food gram and um they are refillable as you can see we we filled it ourselves in the beginning of the video with the uh jetty extracts oil um this is feature patented dual coil cartridge better flavor and breezier inhale and what they mean is that it has this intake valve here this air intake and you can change it from less to more air intake depending on your your likes and dislikes and you know i like mine is very airy so i create big clouds so that's how i had mine set up i had mines all the way open because that's how i like it i don't really like a type pool but some people do some people like those type pools all right so it's a huge airflow benefit of that is it's not like sucking ice cream through a straw its airflow is pretty amazing and yeah i just kind of went over that so that's definitely a truth uh the airflow adjustment blah blah blah fully customizable colors so it has one two three four five different mouthpiece colors that you can order depending on how you want them to go red blue green black and silver which is we what we have here is the silver i myself personally like the silver but i know a lot of people out there like to color code what they're smoking so they can remember the red top is for one the blue top is for another or whatever whatever so yeah that's an option these are lab tested by cannabis analytics lab sc labs for the presence of heavy metals the base of peace of mind that you're not poisoned so you got you know that these things come already tested and clean and ready to go so you don't have no worries in your mind of you know crappy elements being in your oil while you're trying to burn it off uh let me see anything else here um yeah and that's about it so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna turn this camera around and we're gonna give this baby a nice rip so you guys can see exactly how it hits cool so we have the full gram cartridge here and i did wipe that down so you guys could get a better look of it right there check that out and we're going to be putting it on the pen battery bring that together so you guys can see how it looks all together you see that it gave a nice little like triple blink to let you know we have a connection so check that out it's nice look to it too so i think yeah i have my air valve set to wide and let's take a big a big rip of this that's a [ __ ] rhythm it tastes so good it's like because you're doing dabs you're not smoking like traditional you know oil like um vape oils that you find in like these cheap cart cartridges this is jetty extract oil it's pretty much like doing a dab it tastes incredible so we're going to go ahead and close the valve now to negative put it all the way down to negative to minus as you hit like that so you still get a really really strong rip but there's no air you see i choked less too so it's all preference you know what i mean you like the no air a little bit of air you can dial it into as as close to open as you want to or close to close as close to closed as you would prefer so there you go let's do one more big rip with uh let's do it with the with the clothes because i don't want to die so we're gonna we're gonna keep it slightly open we're gonna open it slightly a little bit and uh rip it for the close of the video and there you have it folks the new ispire dual core cartridges check it out on their website getispire.com uh links in the description below plus all their social media stuff is in the description below too uh make sure you guys hit like subscribe share this video with your friends peace [Music] you", "dqIfnsfmBTM": "howdy y'all dan scotland here joining you from legal grasses the heartland of america so for today's episode we're going to be doing another strain review um as always i can be found anywhere you find podcasts such as itunes cast box stitcher tune in radio iheartradio and other platforms like it if you like what we are doing you want to support the podcast you can become a patreon um by by going to patreon.com you can um support the podcast for as little as one dollar a month um i don't take the money and trick it off to strip clubs or whatever um whatever money or whatever funding i do get whether from you know from anchor or whether from from the listeners it gets reinvested into more equipment to make the podcast better it gets reinvested so we can go to excuse me so we can go to other mmj or legal states um it gets reinvested so we can go to conferences and um do even more um so again to support us you can go to bit.ly 2nd mshn and i can be found on twitter at icsativapod i can be found on instagram and i am canvassativa and you can find me on most platforms such as podcast addicts stitcher tune in radio iheart radio spotify google play store itunes and other platforms like it all right so i'm this is the next strain we're reviewing s sf sfvog so i think san francisco valley og so this is from the ten dollar cart folks um let's let's do this only gonna try it it's been getting so much hype okay i don't know this this reminds me of like a cush strain um tastes pretty good um i don't know it reminds me of like like some sort of cush that i've had like um i don't know just the vibe i get i'm feeling the body effects pretty easily and pretty early so if you're someone who medicates you know for body effects or to treat pain i feel like the strain will come in handy because i'm already feeling the body effects as as it is right now it's a pretty smooth vapor it's not like it's not as uh harsh as other ones i've had um i don't know if you can just attribute that to the terpenes they use or maybe that's just how sfv is as a um vape stream but seems like a run in the middle cush already feeling sort of heaviness in my limbs both my arms and my legs um yeah this is this is pretty good um so if you're someone who like me needs um needs strains whether they're cbd rich or thc rich that induce a body effect or that cure cue um sort of body highs and body effects if you're like me and and that's what you need in your medicine this this is this isn't going to do you any wrong this will do the trick it's pretty smooth to vape too it's smoother than a lot of other um screens they have um kind of reminds me a little of king louis the the i don't know was the 14th or whatever it reminds me a little bit of that from the 10 cart folks all right yeah i mean it's it's pretty it's pretty solid um they didn't overdo it with the terpenes you want to keep sort of vaping it um which is good so it shows that it's sort of flavor has staying power because i want to keep you know inhaling on it and again i'm not coughing as much as the other strange so again this is probably one of their premium ones one of their premium strains from 10 carts so again if you use delta eight or you you use cbd or thc you know to medicate and you need strong body effects this is going to definitely do the trick um i don't want to keep this episode too long so as always i can be found anywhere you find podcasts such as itunes cast box stitcher podcast addict radio public tunein radio google play store itunes other other platforms that are like it you can find me on instagram at iamcanvasativa and you can find me on the twitters at icy sativa pod and as always everyone stay medicated my friends peace out and ciao", "5ndyQLqo3Y4": "what's happening party people we're here and I want to beep so odd as it sounds sounds weird coming out of my mouth usually it's I want to dad I want a bong hit one babe all of our faith cartridges are like dunzo check this out they're like it looks like there's something inside but there's nothing inside these I mean I could probably get like little baby hits but they're done I've been sucking on them dry bro like all of them we are out so the revival vape actually comes with empty hive cartridges you guys can see here and you just pop it open take this little thingy off and you can just pour your concentrates in there man simple as that so we're gonna take this syringe of beta my cream and we're gonna make a little vape syringe or vape cartridge with the syringe this is from nectar stick interesting people we see them at all the events they're always there pitching their stuff they sell these full grams in this container for $40 at the events it's probably gonna run you 50 or 60 out of dispensary but this one specifically normally they have like kind of ap flavors like strawberry cough and mango passion this and whatever I asked the guy what do you have for pain and it gave me this it's a ante what does it say pain relief sedative now actually that's upside down sorry guys now I actually hit these people up on Instagram because I was at the event you know I didn't necessarily get the proper explanation of the product you know it wasn't really the kind of place that you sit and you [ __ ] talk science and chemistry about cannabis and [ __ ] but I instagrammed them when I was like hey man I bought your Batum mersin I did I call it Mike Green earlier sorry mersin I bought your beta Mersin and I was curious I mean is this made with cannabis does this contain THC or CBD you know give me some give me some info about this all I have is the package and the package isn't too descriptive either zero PPM's solvent free ultra refined nothing doesn't tell you like percentages doesn't tell you anything so I'm curious like is this a pure I guess I should have explained it if you guys don't know with what beta mercian is I check it out on wiki because that's basically how I learned what it is it beta mercian is basically a component in cannabis it's like a terpenoid it's one of the things that are a part of the we'd like THC CBD CBN THC a all of those get you high and then there are actually compounds that give you flavor like limonene citrus scene or something lemons this is the citrus one hash machine there are a couple of different flavor compounds and these compounds are found in everything I could find citrus or limonene in limes I can find that in oranges I can extract it from those you know and it's also found in cannabis that's why some weed smells like oranges some weed smells like smoke it's are like smoke because you've spoken it some weed smells like like dirt and like earth you know like it literally has the same chemicals they're in those other things so this is one of those chemicals and if you smoke this chemical by itself or not smoke it but you know consume it it's supposed to make you feel relaxed sedative it's supposed to make you sleepy it's supposed to be a good anti and Kalama tori it's it's got a bunch of qualities you can read them all on the on the wiki so I got this and I was like man this should be excellent for medicating and then I had a realization where I was like isn't this the same [ __ ] that they have in mangoes that everybody says gets you higher if you smoke it or if you consume it so if I'm smoking like a really low grade weed or even if I just want to get higher supposedly if I eat a mango it's high in the Mersin and that is what gives me like a bigger high so I was like man this would be excellent for a cush Buster's or something where I'm like [ __ ] eating mangoes I'm literally gonna go to a scientist have him extract the Mersin give it to me straight up and I'll test it for you guys and I'll be like I'm gonna smoke a gram of this shitty weed and then take a hit of the mercy and and see if it helps then I'm gonna take a hit of the top shelf with the Mersin and see if that improves the hit as well and then do like control test like this is awesome so we're just gonna stick this in here like a mad scientist and just fill it up I want to I use it up I use half of this I want to leave some for dabbing but or just see if it even works let's just use less let's see if it even works you don't want to put all of your nugs in one basket you know what I'm saying I lost a little stopper there's like a little shirt oh there it is it's so tiny put the stopper in I guess I think I went the other way whoops got it all weedy so cool we do that and we're good to go let's try it out I've been smoking it I took it home you guys and I was like let's get [ __ ] up like we went to the event and it was like a marijuana edible sesh and if you guys watched the the podcast if you guys haven't seen it it's the podcast from the weekend of like May 14th May 15th like that and we talked about how we got trapped in the elevator we almost died going to like a weed event and if I get to the weed event and I don't even get to smoke that much or like get that high so I came home and I was like man I'm gonna take a huge hit and I literally smoked like a fifth of it at once and it was a immense hit it was super clean super flavorful particularly for the size usually you take a huge dab of something and it's really rough like it just it kills your lungs it's like it leaves you wheezing but it was super clean and a him Ian waves bro it was like at first like you kind of you feel a little bit after the initial hit but it doesn't like hit you and then like a couple minutes later you start you feel like almost like a wave hit you and like you feel like more buzzing more like higher and more relaxed and then like five minutes later boom like another wave a couple minutes later like another wave and eventually like after 15-20 minutes I was like oh gone I was just like laying in the couch like dunzo really nice I mean I smoked the point point to grammar but let's try it out I'll see how if it works cross your fingers for me I hate wasting weed drum roll please nothing I have to take the thingy out these thingies have the thingy the cartridges have the little stopper so I don't necessarily have to take the stopper out and it's hot I can feel it at the base it's just not it's not doing anything I'm glad I didn't put more one more time get in there get in there I think it's just so thick that it's having a hard time vaping it we're getting there we're getting there has a really good flavor to it it tastes it tastes very similar to the pickled monkey cartridges that we received I think they're using like a similar solvent free filler pretty sure now it's ripping brah brah it's ripping oh yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I cannot tell you guys if it has THC or not in it I I can't offer the life let me tell you I would like to tell you that it doesn't and that I am smoking a pure beta Mersin and that this is simply the the effect of that because it almost feels a little different from a high when I take a big hit of this and I take a big hit of weed the high sit separately from each other if you know what I'm saying like one of them I like I know is like weed and on the other once it's like distantly in the back affectingly me very differently I don't know I wish they would get back to me on Instagram yo I hate when companies are like secretive about their process and like the products that they're giving you I'm literally [ __ ] smoking this and putting it in my lungs how about you [ __ ] tell me what's in this bro like people who make food have to literally list ingredients legally and that people who have these [ __ ] smokeable products don't even have to [ __ ] lab test it or anything it's crazy it was like a graphic the other day going around a mean and it was a I don't know the character name he's like a famous like character actor he has a curly hair he's like blonde and it's like um you have you notice you ever noticed how there's no more powdery mildew anymore ever since everybody to learn how to make concentrates and it was like like that [ __ ] like man you never know what you're putting into your lungs anymore you know like they could just take any weed they want run it and it just looks golden and good you know and unless it actually gets tested by a lab or something I'm not gonna know if it's safe or not to smoke so I hate when companies are like [ __ ] shady about [ __ ] like [ __ ] tell me bro like what the [ __ ] like I'm gonna go steal your process and whatever like as if there are like 10 other companies do right now how about you just be honest with your consumer base and let them know what they're literally smoking bro what strain is in this what am i even smoking is this even weed these are my questions I think they're fair I don't know but it's pretty far I ask these questions I semi complain but also smoke it also smoking I purposely did this one just so that I know I knew that I wouldn't necessarily waste the weed as much because I feel like big cartridges are more efficient than like dabbing like when you dab you just some of it burns away maybe it's too high temp of a dab like you're literally electronically controlling the temperature with the vaporizer so I feel like it's more efficient and what was my point with that right I wanted a lot of smoke because I'm actually doing a product shoot over there and I'm actually doing shots where like there's products all laid out and then I blow smoke and like smoke comes into the frame and like you know [ __ ] high production [ __ ] and it's actually been really hard to make like volumous smoke I literally that's why I have the illa Delft over here I was gonna pack a bomb hit for the shoot because I've tried vaping I've tried using is it here I tried using the dryer vape and I even tried taking a DAB and unless I took like a huge dab I couldn't get a significant volume of smoke so like look impressive enough on the screen so I have to pack some flowers bro into the old illy and start ripping I thought this would be it but it makes clouds but now I mean look at the size difference I mean if this made clouds this big I'd be scared like what is in this what witchcraft did they like make this with some make it do that but still pretty fire I'm gonna go get the weed pack up a bowl and I'll see you guys next time on the daily grind thank you guys for joining me and let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comments man you guys rocking a vape pen vape cartridge have you ever refilled one of these before do you make your own eliquid I think a couple of followers have mentioned in the past that they do their own like pg/vg mix or some [ __ ] like let me know in the comments I am really new to the whole vaping world so I am very curious to hear what people's personal preferences are particularly after they've had a consistent career token it up contouring on the vape level you know what I'm saying I'll see you guys next time stay regularly", "0e7yTnO03F4": "welcome to the shits and giggles Channel what's up this is where we review eight products depending on if we like them or not today I have a cartridge by California dab company it's a hybrid hopefully it's good and we'll see if it turns out to be what I expect it to be because you know the total percentage of cannabinoids in it it's 91% and then the THC is Android and 60 milligrams so it's pretty good so let's check it out as you can see there is a container or like a little thingy that I was already messing with because I had previously opened it but for the most part it's like a little container thing that they put it in that way children don't mess with it and get involved with it so I'll come back after trying it out and let's see what I have in store for the review see you guys in a bit one utility later I'm back I'm a little bit faded well not a little bit it's actually a pretty good cartridge it looks like this if you could type in chiefing on it of her good games you can tell it's already the next day because I'm definitely wearing a different shirt but you know gotta be honest with you guys but besides thought I will say that the cartridge is pretty legit you feel a little bit uplifted but it's more of a mellow high because it's annika dominant hybrid ask for taste it tastes very like mmm I guess you could say house like a little bit of a earthy taste but yeah if anything it sounds like a earthy taste to the dab or like the cartridge but it's both definitely potent and depending on the person honestly like it could be potent for me and not posting for you but I will tell you that I have a high tolerance so like I usually like stuff that's pretty strong so I will tell you for sure you should go check it out it's probably at your local dispensary it's called California adapt company when I have is trainwreck anyways be sure to check the cartridge company out and let me know in the comments if you've tried it before or like wanting to go try the cartridge or the company and if you liked this review please smash that thumbs up button and subscribe and leave a comment below if you have anything to say thank you and have a great day shits and giggles Bamm out", "rlr2Yxg74h8": "okay so now we've filled up the point eight Miller a m'q rod with ceramic tib-fib cartridge we have it attached to one of our variable push-button vape pens that we sell off our website at cheapest vape supplies calm so we're gonna test this out right now and do a couple puffs and see how it works out mm good cloud vapor very clean I could definitely notice it's very clean tasting much cleaner than any metal rod cartridge out there obviously because ceramic is very clean I like this cartridge it's pretty good I'll have to do some will have to do some further tests on it too to see how it performs in the long run but overall I like the taste and I do like the cloud vapor very much so this is a good cartridge we're going to carry these on our website from here on out and cheap is very surprising I count thank you", "FY83GHn0kQs": "how do y'all dance Kotlin here joining you from legal grass at Chasen's the heartland of america so for today's episode we're going to be reviewing another $10 cartridge strain this time is straughn and right here

right here Rawdon Anna here's the cart right here has the rubber tip now I'm gonna put it in and use it $10 cartridge 10 flippin bucks but um if you want there one milliliter one it's 18 which is still a steal and like I mentioned Delta Aid at least for me it feels like the real McCoy feels like a distinction without a difference it feels like if I was if I was if my back was against the wall now sore and I was offered a high-paying job in like a state like Texas for example to to work in the heavy industry and I had a void THC my back was against the wall I could perceivably do it on Delta 8 and CBD but as you guys all know THC at least for me that's my number one medicine when it comes to cannabis but now we're gonna see how strong Ana is you slight nanner after taste like all the other ones I've been getting from $10 cart it's like oh my god this is going to be this like it is to that a degree but you have to really have to pay attention again maybe it may be my taste buds suck I don't know but again I think this is like a feature with this company but that doesn't take away that it tastes good it just it's just not going to be it's just not going to be strawberry banana at Specter in my in my estimation or whatever flea or the advertised it's it has that essence but it's not like it's not as pronounced as you would think it would be but in terms of the effect and how it hits it hits pretty perfectly I'm getting a quite a bit of a body high right now again I mean you're gonna want to be careful with how you inhale you know Delta eight it is going to be a bit harsher to inhale Delta eight you do have to keep that in mind even would get manufacturers like the like the folks we've tried three chi and $10 cartridge Delta in generals just can be harsher on your on your throat a bit and harsher it's gonna be a hard for vape but you can tell the V put tender love and care into their ingredients and they get it for you at a value so this is strong Anna from 10 $10 cartridge folks they're out of Oregon Oregon has blue you have both sides of the game corner where those the CBD and hemp game and whether its THC with the cheapest cannabis in the United States a $50 sprouts for outdoor flower that is but here you go you one of their better tasting ones I will say that out of all the ones that I've tried it's one of their better tasting ones I would say yeah so in terms of in terms of taste I'm I would say the King King Louie the third things a 13 or 14 Thor whatever it was that I love the effects of that that was but I absolutely positively love the smell the most with this I still get somewhat of a body high not the strongest body high you've ever had from Delta 8 but pretty good one so if you're in need of Delta 8 cartridges and you know you can't or don't want to use Steve C I would highly recommend checking out $10 cartridge and I'll link to them in the description and if you for whatever reason to want to use PFC I'm traditional TV or you live in a state where it's not available have no fear you can you can get Delta 8 and shout out to my Oregon listeners and especially shout out to Virginia it's a new day right now as of right now July 1st Virginia has decriminalize cannabis for everyone in this different fur for adults in the state it's a $25 ticket with if you're caught with an ounce or less again that's that's that's more generous a southern state a shout-out to Virginia I have a lot of Virginia listeners I'm shoutout to you CIA Nancy and CIA Brad shout-out to you guys we love you not not hating on on you and and

that what I'm doing or the the message of trying to make cannabis affordable and accessible for regular people and regular Joes and Janes from around the world I hope that what I'm doing in my ranting sort of helps you but [ __ ] but we're gonna have before we close out the review in the episode let's just have one giant bought huge cough smoke no let's I'm gonna double-fist some vape cards right now so I'm gonna double it so the green one was the straw Nana which we just reviewed and like this one I I think this is skittles I'm not entirely sure the one I want to see it's that but I'm in a double fist for Virginia right now as of today the FD criminalize cannabis and again Virginia has a much much more lenient decrement the criminalization policy than a lot of northeastern states if your car would more than half an ounce in Connecticut you get in deep trouble and in New Hampshire who have more than three quarters of an ounce you're in deep trouble too but Virginia the former Richmond Virginia was the former formal was the formal or the the former yeah so Virginia was the Richmond Virginia was the former capital of the Confederacy and now cannabis has been decriminalized there times are flipping changing and shout out to the the the advocates and the protesters and all over the world and in Mississippi that got rid of the Confederate flag on their logo right now we're gonna double fists for all these good things but especially to Virginia decriminalizing canvas and having E one of the most generous knee cream was in the country you peace", "v7eQ8UTo-Ug": "howdy y'all Dan Scott lean here joining you from legal grass that she sits the heartland of America so for today's episode I'm going to be reviewing this Delta 8 cartridge yes Delta 8 not not the Delta 9 that you commonly associate with THC but there's another form of THC there's Delta 8 that comes before 9 and there's also Delta 10 but I haven't heard of any vendors creating Delta 10 carts at this moment in time right now so I'm just gonna be reviewing what I do have in my hands which is a Delta 9 THC cartridge from 3qi and I've plugged them before on this podcast but I've actually given this actual vape cart the the light of day I've given it a chance and Delta 8 I got it quacks very much like the same duck of cannabis they did it's it feels if you told me that this was a different form of THC I wouldn't I would have I would I would would think it's the same wing of the of the same bird and but yeah so I bought their purple punch Delta Delta eight cartridge that the particular cartridge has about 900 milligrams of Delta 850 milligrams of CBN and CBC and 50 milligrams of terpenes alright so I got this purple punch vape cart from from the folks of 3qi and so do this all right this is what this looks like 3qi this is the cart so you're gonna vape it right now in front of you guys if you look in the video version of this excuse me all right so I vaped it it's like any other vape card if you vape a little too much and you put a little too much we're taking a little too much vapor we are gonna get the coughs and that's what happened I mess with the rooster and got and got the beak but but now with that hefty sort of vape poll that I got you could you could taste the purple purple grape II sort of sweetness to it and it's very apparent in that and in this cart so does it does for taste and flavor it tastes like purple punch concentrates I've had in the past so it does hold up I feel high I don't feel the same debilitating high that a good edible would make me feel or even just like a job two bowls of a 2 2 full cannabis bowls smoking before bed that kid it packs a punch and does the the what I find with Delta Aid is that it feels I still feel the same body it effects of a that I would feel from a good indica I sort of I still feel the same sort of Medicaid medicated that I would with with regular teeth see um what I do notice is that the Delta eight by itself I just vape it by itself like it tends to fade very quickly or in my experience it like you feel the high but then it just it fades and I feel like it fades quicker than if you had had a regular THC count cart so I I do feel that the sticking power with the high in the duration of the highs is shorter with this Delta aid cart and with this Delta eight that I'm trying but I'm what I do notice when I combine it with my THC and CBD I do notice that my sleep is a lot better because I'm getting the anuradha fact and I do feel that Delta eight with Delta nine by itself I feel like it's a lethal combo for for my sleep like it's you take it and it's like oh man it's like I'm hitting the snooze alarm again like I feel that my suppli supplementation of Delta aid with that my Delta nine in my CBD I feel like that's done a world of good and for for treating my illnesses that works actually better than just typical Delta nine I've a fried CBN concentrated like I've like I've mentioned again didn't see the big ruckus in it but I put a gram on my flour I put no I put a little bit on my own flour I put a little bit when I would vape and I again I didn't really feel that much kick from cbn I didn't really feel that oh I'm so gosh darn tired I feel like I get more of a kick from a delta eight and then Delta nine and having that together I feel like I get way more doing that than just getting cbn pills or cbn concentrate which I've gone before and didn't really didn't really live up to the hype but this Delta 8 stuff like if you want a good sort of if you want to replicate that body high and you know you move to a new city or state and don't really have your connects like this is as close as you'll get to the actual THC without having it without having to take spice or anything like that you still all the hallmarks of a traditional high are still there it's just just a bit less intense and it just fades quicker like that's what I've noticed from taking this powerful punch and what I've evaluated over the course of a few days but what I do feel that we're gonna learn and what what people a lot smarter than me are gonna find out is that Delta eight and nine and when you combine it can work very very well when when when taken without Delta eight so Delta eight and nine complement each other very well I definitely feel the hallmarks of a traditional high without you know the without the sort of oh my god this is out of control Ness about it like you you feel high but it's a very sort of controlled high you know it's not it's not like a sound like a sativa edible or whatever that oh my god I'm high I'm high and I don't want to be high anymore pleases no I don't I don't know I don't feel that with Delta eight it's a very it's a very controlled sort of high doesn't feel too much different than a one I would say a one to one sort of strain might offer you a comparable experience my opinion where you feel both he feels M you feel sort you feel impaired but you still you still don't feel like it's out of control boy so I feel like that's what I feel like these are going to be like the new one to ones or maybe you'll have one part Delta a one part Delta nine I feel like that's gonna be the way of the future I do feel that you know for sleep having supplementing with Delta Aid and my THC I feel that the sleep I get is deeper when I sleep when I wake up I'm hidden snooze a little bit more often because the claudius lead that I'm used to getting under Delta aid definitely improves when I paired with Delta nine flower but yeah we've gone into what Delta eight is in previous episodes I would I would recommend you check out these cards they're the one milliliter card was honest aid after shipping was $65 or something like that so if you live in a state where the met both medical or adult use are still very new and still very expensive you may be able to come out ahead buying Delta eight cards as they continue as more continue to go in the market there's another vendor I just ordered four cards from that that's selling their cards for ten bucks apiece which is a lot cheaper than than what I got with three tree but um but again that's it's it's that's still in the mail now so when we get those cards were gonna review we're gonna review that vendor there are new vendor to so we're gonna be what among the first people reviewing it hopefully but yeah I'm if you want something that's gonna complement the medical reasons why you use canvas I guess let's say you use it for anxiety use it for whatever I mean we're all different you know CBD affects me different than it affects UTC affects me differently Delta eight will affect me differently or affect you differently but I do notice that it amplifies the qualities that I find so medicinal about about indicas and it complements that body hi that I need and I need to treat my illnesses and my symptoms in compliments that perfectly it doesn't make the hi out of control it's it's a good enhancer you know and and I find that I don't get like I mean I don't get as paranoid anymore with with with cannabis but I do find that with this Delta eight like it's it's it's kind of like CBD but not you know you know in a sense that it it's able to neutralize it but you are still gonna feel impaired compared to not taking Delta eight or Delta nine you like you're still gonna feel something it is it is gonna so pack a punch and you should understand how your body can handle it before handling heavy machinery but yeah I would highly recommend checking out Delta eight cards if you have the ability to do so again the entourage effect you know all these cannabinoids work better in concert as opposed to just in isolation so again if you have the cash you have the funds and have the ability to get Delta eight cards and you're looking for something that might enhance or amplify your body high from cannabis that you use to treat various different illnesses like if you're sewing in which the body high is needed or the effects that are granted from a body highs needed then Delta eight is gonna be your friend in my opinion I I will say that before letting you all go but yeah I would highly recommend you check out three tree & shaki to live in a state check to see if you live in a state where Delta eight can be shipped to you first make sure you do that before anything else and yeah um if you have the funds and you have the ability to do it and I would check it out so as always everyone I'm their humble and gracious hosts dance Scotland I can be

do you forget that here I got their names right this is Lizzie for my blog say hi alright so we're at Jessica's house alright Jessica Jessica do you hear me Jessica exists oh whatever alright bacon and salad and the chili chicken going on not a chicken's chickens okay don't forget that so we're gonna be doing a little this is just part of the vlog I haven't decided if it's gonna be a separate part of the vlog or if it's gonna be in it probably in it but we're gonna review raw garden right now so she already open the cart but I know everyone likes to see the boxes so we decided just to keep it back so you can see you too okay remember do we're gonna have them all try it and see if they like it or not so this is the raw garden cartridge this is how their packaging looks and this one is an indica hybrid it's very punch 88 percent THC less than 0.2 percent CBD so a told a lot of a thousand milligrams in the cartridge 881 milligrams their total THC content so she has it on this giant battery here which if you watch my previous videos I use the little ones but she likes these giant ones that way it doesn't ever die because when does it die two months though well how many you don't smoke that much though right so how many carts did you use through it so one part took her two months right that's a long maybe you think using your car other people will be like a week okay okay so what do you like marijuana for yeah same I use it for anxiety as well how do you forget that well I'm also to help me with my going to sleep and stuff but I also like it just you know for the high which is good and what's this women what is berry oh it doesn't say one thing I hope California passes on their packaging laws is that they force you to write sativa or indica or hybrid it does say indica hybrid on this box but if you remember there's another review I did or it might be going up soon which talks about cheap extracts I love their packaging I like the cart I did smoke through it but I didn't like that they don't say indica sativa hybrid that's something that really you know to me it matters because I like to know what I'm smoking I'll smoke uh sativa or indica any day but you know just for the people who really want something specific or they want to know what they're smoking on I think it's a good thing you know it might already be a requirement I'm not sure I'll check all right try it everything and smoke offended I already took the hit the Foos those attorneys are a virgin it's strong you know that one hand she's done the dog barking in the bathroom or not in the bathroom in the bedroom is their dog that just got neutered yeah this one's actually better better than some of the ones that I've been trying out lately but I do like this robber named cartridge right here all right that was it just us so this probably will just get shoved into the vlog because it's a really little review but I just wanted to do it a little review on the wrong garden cards for a close-up of how they look I'll do a one Little Rock close-up they are really nice part I like that it's just a plain white plastic and not like a colored plastic like some carts do to me you know I'd rather just have a plain and simple cartridge with a good oil in it oil and it's pretty clear it's not like clear clear though or like one of those super dark and yellow tinted ones this one I think she's had four I gave it to her like a week or two ago doesn't change color or nothing which is something that I noticed in some cars especially if you start popping on them like she said though she only started smoking this like a day ago so there's probably no color change that's gonna happen but I'll check with her later on and see if there's any color changers cuz it takes her two months to smoke a cart so I'm just sayin everyone what's up it is paint allottee signing out you guys have any questions or comments go ahead and write them in the comment section you guys want go ahead and like comment subscribe and if that notification valve have a good weekend you guys thanks for watching the video [Music] brain be even when I'm with my boo my baby over you", "yPGR0OavHVw": "[Music] [Applause] you this is the blue dream deep cartridge it's almost done now I do want to know that good supply is also an affray accompany so a freons like good supply is a Frias over the counter or recreational brand so a lot of the terpenes are very similar to the ones that they have all in there wait for the actual medical prescriptions which is kind of interesting but I do find this one works a little bit better ice it's similar to like a Churchill as far as I find it gives me an indica of fact it makes me sleepy I can't really focus very much this one's supposed to have a very flavor to it I don't really feel that it's very berry eat it is sweet though it does say on the profile for it or the description that it's supposed to be sweet flavored why do you find it is fairly sweet so I woke up from that one but overall it is good I actually have a migraine and will probably use this to take a nap this afternoon because I have a migraine and I'm going to try and get some rest in because there's a thunderstorm coming and hopefully it won't wreck my body completely so so I will use this to help me with sleep and nausea I will try to sleep it off this migraine so as far as what I use this again yes I would I would use this one again I even think I might like this one better then the \u00e1free\u00e1 better than the Africa cartridges or at least not all not all of them because I really really like the Aspen but as far as and I teach the potency one I think I like this one better than the one that you can get on the prescription five for sure [Music] [Applause]", "Wb_49pJWVfc": "[Music] I woke up today said I wanna be a star walking down the street how's it going hey God right here our honeycomb clear Thin Mint this one's a hybrid I think I can try but honeycomb hybrids yet it always impresses me about honeycombed is how absolutely filled up the cart started it like an air bubble so of course looks like an egg it literally had a set with it they really tested it low key and then got rid of it well I could already see some turps some turps building up over there I'll be testing it with you know traditional straight batteries and not box mod and Maasai defense hello cap right here our bottom tip and everything oh yeah so I will be put in string on this straight back and my first action has to preheat it if it makes a sound try to hear too honest yeah don't burn I literally never try pin it my whole height they're based on the preheat I think it's gonna be a little unique well it's Oh voltage we're pinning this or three three and a half volts [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I have the first thing now to say is taste yeah I'll take something going strength oh no I would go on the blinker because there this battery yeah that's a little interesting yo can be smart this one I think do you feel Miller's I felt like it was like 30 say this is I think they go 15 seconds with blinkers a post in time his wife fell so long I'll be able to get such a huge dick I have two really really nice of my official on batteries like this [Music] oh yeah oh yeah oh I fell you know any bubbles happen because the heat and yeah there are some after it you know going down at all like technologies he can't notice oh yeah now after the taste because I went off with a [ __ ] blinker and that kind of got all the strength a little bit very short that's what it says baby yeah I definitely do feel stronger like distillate II them to the saucepan or whatever that I just found I was with 81% but now because it's working this look and I reached nope that's why I'm getting kind of higher higher so if I smoke that after this I would definitely feel probably something like that that it's not like so easy to tell it is that I also did notice saw something just when they make sauces usually motor full-spectrum taste it tastes like then I was shot like I thought would be like more cookie or just like weed doesn't it taste like The Thin Man girl stuff cookies and I did not expect that from 10 that would make very high like cousin would you'd expect on tough or social or blunder like a white our subject I love the white grapes in the blue rather that's for whether or not this time has given me an actual hybrid hybridized effect it does taste like yes and it doesn't say mint a little bit hey hey go straight I do that cause the window for win oh that's yeah I think definitely on the hybrid sides I think and the kids usually would make me want to collapse in order for this one I just like well if it's like bad you have class us one time I bet I've definitely had to I put this one in the charger already like that was a straightening the coup when I hit it first [Applause] Oh there is some natural cannabis taste though it might be this lid but there's like listen sighs it's not just have mints like a candy because it like a it's not piney but its birth yeah we're just laughs I always used pine-sol apology cushion really groups that I will I look forward lemon bertha mint it's like a I find a public push heavy hitters so gasps so 25 I think I got some yeah but I know how the hitters are still expensive today at hell three years ago it tastes like the public fish mixed with if you were to stop the menthol it's just like that is it's is this a satisfying it's not as full of a profile as I would have liked so this one even though the bubbles like it's nice it's just it maybe had some lemon up I guess I'm looking for like a wooden altar pans or whatever how about I go four and a half stars and then I realized the hybrids cleared immediately they always take me longer and just in that segments I'm realizing this is a hybrid which means it's 50% sativa so yeah that's why because of that's a great height oh yeah [Music] four thumbs mushrooms perfect in Stockton t summon three in a row of three round bursts of green leaves intact Oh Amy impression back by the purified shots of the flesh [Music]", "p62i-lwAn8o": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4/20 here today I'm going to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind", "7lzO0jxgTzA": "howdy y'all dan scotland here joining you from legal massachusetts the heartland of america so for today's episode we're going to be reviewing another 10 cart um in case you haven't listened to the previous episode um they're they're uh their their initial batch of vape carts which is um which is pretty much all of them because they've just started as a company they found out that that some of the sea salt carts are counterfeit um so um you don't know if these so we don't know if these carts um you know or we don't know if you know because of their counterfeit then they might be late in with heavy metals or what have you because you can have the best sort of distillator product but if the vape cards if you can't ascertain the the quality of the vape cards and the materials that that are in them then then you don't know if there's heavy metal you don't know if they cut corners with the soldering material you don't you don't know a number of different things so again i mean if you have money to take your business elsewhere i would recommend you do so but um but me i mean cannabis is pretty unaffordable it's pretty expensive in my market um so i gotta i gotta i gotta do all the cost cutting that i can i can get you know i'm that person having a ration dog insulin you know it's i don't bring in a lot of money and the the cannabis in in the state is over 350 an ounce so um any and any vendor that can make cannabinoids at a price that i'd afford i'm gonna i'm gonna buy from um again i'm not pleased that they're doing that that some of their carts have been found to be counterfeit but you know it is what it is so i mean i i got nowhere else to go but um but for those of you who are in the same boat as me i'm going to continue pumping out these reviews all right so as always i can be found anywhere you find podcasts such as itunes cast box stitcher google play i heart radio tune in spotify and other platforms like it i can be found on twitter at icy sativa pod i can be found on instagram and i am cannabis sativa all right so i'm going to be reviewing another uh ten dollar cart and um so this is juicy fruit um limit limited release um so so they have these sort of special carts with with um with with flavorings that i think it's like two dollars extra or whatever their limited edition edition so this is juicy fruit we're gonna try this right now all right they're nailing it on the taste this does taste like juicy fruit literally tastes pretty close um you know i get that the strain names are not always supposed to be literal but they they're pretty on the money first impression um i'm creating a pr i'm feeling a pretty quick onset um body effect right now um limbs feel a little bit heavier um i could still get done when i want to get done but i am going to drag but doing so in a sense um so the onset effect it's pretty quick pretty quick and um all right so yeah it's the onset of fat is pretty quick um it does it tastes so much like like the like the gum they're better tasting ones too the vapor isn't too harsh at all um take pretty sizable hits like i'm bound to do and not feel too bad being so yeah i really don't want to move my limbs right now so if you're looking for a sort of a heavy body effect or a good sort of booster to your thc or your cbd or cbg regimen this this would be a very good booster towards that you know especially if you struggle with with sleep issues like myself i find that i need heavy indicas whether they be cbd or thc and um yeah i find that i need a heavy indicas and delta eight you know having a few puffs on top of it um tense tends to help out that sort of heavy body high that i need to to fall asleep um my head's still pretty clear but the body effects not so clear i'm pretty pretty heavy-hitting but yeah i mean i would highly recommend checking this out if you know if i mean do bear in mind that their their carts are counterfeit so you don't know we don't know where they're getting the material um we don't know when they knew when did how how did they know and when did they know it you know um but again if you're like me and you live and you live in a market where medical marijuana is still very expensive or um you live in a state that doesn't even have recreational or you live in a state where the politicians don't want to give you medical because it's against quote unquote the bible and i mean there's still plenty of states like that in the us but but again check to see if delta eight is is legal in your neck of the woods because in some states you know delta eight isn't is is illegal so you can't have it shipped to you but um definitely check that out definitely do the research but again i don't want to keep this strain review too long as always that can be found anywhere you find podcasts such as itunes stitcher cass box radio public iheart radio google play store itunes and other platforms like it if you want to support the podcast you can do so for as little as a buck a month joining will get you strain reviews

you know i love today supposedly this morning when when i was on the internet early this morning the daa banned delta eight then a whole bunch of d8 sellers online just stopped you know stopped selling d8 politics online but now apparently you know ten dollar cartridge pop you know are still selling delta eight and you know earlier earlier today delta earlier today i mean 10.00 cartridges.com stopped selling the update politics altogether earlier today but now they're selling it again and and now apparently the ban is going to be held off until october which uh hopefully that's the case that's the case right now hopefully that's the case but anyway i'm not gonna talk much i'm going to go ahead and open this package i got my front camera on on my phone so you want me you're not going to see me physically oh package as you see i'm halfway up with it right now it's sealed oh let me get this open now let's go tear it got a piece of paper this is my my order this is my order covering my um address i don't want you to see my drive says private but here is my order all right now time to open the package [Applause] open it as you all see nothing else is in the package completely empty alrighty here is my half gram of purple punch right there also got a full gram of limited release runs and black cherry soda 1 gram as well i'm going to try all these products right now first off i'm going to try the purple punch half game cart to get ahead of that with these packages you know well right here you know it's completely sealed right here and it kind of breaks the whole packaging when i break it so i'm going to open it from the other side and just open it halfway bring this paper back then get the cartridge out put it back i don't want to destroy the packages because i'm saving saving these packages for them for the memories of the delta 8 i bought because soon enough you know well october apparently it's gonna be officially banned so when you open it it has a silicon seal at the bottom they have like two different type of cartridges well three different type now they got the they got the pods now online but you know here's here's one of them one type of cartridge right here which is a which is a clear round tip and they also got you know the ceramic white tip as well so go hop it off with my my gold pen right here what i like about this about this 510 thread pen is you could put concentrate in this container and you can just screw it back on but that's neat but let's try the delta 8 right here to see with this pen you know i like to screw it in all the way then then loosen it a little bit for airflow because it does this this battery doesn't have built-in airflow so i gotta loosen the cartridge a little bit for airflow but those are my third first thoughts of my purple punch i haven't tried this labor and these other two flavors i got too here we go cheers yeah that tastes pretty good the purple punch i actually taste purple punch as usual uh as of the ten dollar cart all right now i'm going to try let me try runts now save black cherry soda for last that's what i look forward for tasting at most open the runts hmm oh there we go with a ceramic mouthpiece tip the silicone covers at the bottom and the top just take them off throw it on my floor clean it later all right and when you order these one gram card to know usually the bubble it's around this size i don't know if you can see it or not trying to focus it nope still look kind of blurry but but you kind of see it but here is the runts cheers well but also wait before cheers with a ceramic tip you know you see how you see how the tip right here is sideways you could actually turn the tip so you could turn it where it could be horizontal to the power button which is a pretty nice feature of the cartridge i agree but runs cheers okay the runs i taste a whole bunch of different fruits in it i taste pineapple tastes mango some other foods i don't know i guess some other exotic fruits that's probably okay why i can't explain other fruits but but but the flavors are familiar of i taste i taste pineapple and it tastes mango and some exotic exotic fruit as well the runts taste a lot better than i thought it would but but here's um finally what you all been waiting for it was black cherry soda open that right now for you smoke that [ __ ] be geeking i'm feel high already okay i accidentally cracked the seal but you know we just got one little crack in the package mine are local no big deal but here's the runts it's kind of a little bit harder to open the package is kind of new because right here needs to be the spacing right here used to be a little bit longer so it was like a little bit easier for me to take out the packet the um cartridges out but but the shortened space a lot and now the one game cartridge is tight fitting to these to the space so it's kind of hard to take out but here's a black cherry i got it in this video soon in about a minute so i think it's like 14 minutes but we'll take this hit real quick loosen up a little bit yup yup that was that's my favorite yep that actually tasted exactly like black cherry soda but i hope you all enjoyed this video enjoy this review of my ten dollar cartridge my delta eight from 10 cartridges.com and don't forget to subscribe like and and click that bell and click on you know all notifications on it and have a good one", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do

express vape cartridge yes sir it's all about this baby right here so i'm gonna get to the review right here right now so i'm gonna open the seal up right here here we have the cannabis canadian seal um i think i'm gonna use a nice pen to open it up can't wait to taste this apparently apparently the guy at the dispensary told me this is the best tasting vape cart he's ever tasted so let's see if he's right let's see this is the best tasting vape cartridge out there and the child lock always gets me man child lock always gets me it's well made it's well made not even gonna lie a few moments later this child lock really got me right now like it really really got me [Music] god damn it bro here we [ __ ] go god damn [Music] here we are with pine apple express vape cartridge let's give it a nice close-up shot so i'm going to take off first seal here we are about the second seal come on [Music] man so if you don't know already pineapple express is a slightly sativa leaning dominant hybrid generally has a super good taste it doesn't have the best of the best of all highs it's widely famous for the movie pineapple express with joe rogan i mean uh seth rogen and james franco apparently it is the best tasting dab cartridge vape cartridge out there and i guess i have that good supply battery pack and a good supply pineapple express vape cartridge so without further ado let's taste pineapple express oh my god this tastes like the [ __ ] bomb man oh lord holy [ __ ] name man bro i swear to god if you give this to a child he would think this is like a smoking candy pen right this tastes like pineapple this [ __ ] tastes like actual dead ass pineapple i wouldn't have thought that it actually tastes like pineapple the clerk at the dispensary was not kidding like he was dead ass not kidding so i'll take a few more puffs damn damn i feel a body hot no wait hold up hold up hold up give me a sec give me a sec no i can feel the mind high right away like it's weird but i already feel it it's right up in my brain and just hit me directly and i don't know if that's because this is a dang ass deep cartridge but this [ __ ] got me really big really fast oh hold up wait a minute i'll show you what else they gave me at the dispensary so i was like the thousandth ten thousand whatever thousand customer at their [ __ ] store and they gave me one big ass six six foot long [ __ ] towel beach towel whatever i'm not too sure about the thc levels of it it has thc 796.89 milligrams per gram if somebody can translate that to me in percentages in the comments below that would be very very appreciated because i have no [ __ ] clue how to calculate this so is it so oh okay no no no no no no no need to give me the answer i found it i'm just [ __ ] [ __ ] right thc 796.89 milligrams per gram how much is a gram a gram is a hundred somethings right 100 milligrams i think so if i divide 796 by 100 it gives me 79.68 so there's about 80 percent thc in the pineapple express who said stoners are [ __ ] [ __ ] nobody i'm smart as [ __ ] [Music] so i think that's enough uh [ __ ] i think that's enough puffs for me today it got me pretty baked it got me pretty baked it gave me a nice smooth sativa high like i'm i'm kind of gigglish i'm not even gonna lie and like you know i feel like talking i feel like cracking up some shitty jokes you know i mean but i'ma keep it a buck with you i'm pretty pretty baked above all and it really helps it really hits well it has an amazing taste an amazing taste i might go as to say it's one of the best vape cartridges i've ever tasted but that's to say that's the good supply one i don't know if the other ones taste as good but this one was really well made it really tasted good compared to the like three four others i've tasted pretty good pretty solid so yeah that was pineapple express if you did enjoy this video then drop a like and hit that subscribe button this is tony robb you guys know the drill and i'm out", "rNE8BbB9rKU": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what's up y'all the sky high on georgia pie car just came in and here's my first impressions the smell is weird you know not weird in a like you know bad way but like i didn't expect it to smell so vibrant [Music] like it smells like a candy guys like it smells like a real sweet kind of peachy kind of candy cheers no way that tasted so much better than roper for labs hold on guys [Music] wow guys this is so much better than the rogue river carts but this georgia pie cart is amazing man what's up guys boy p2 peeps today we're going to be checking out sky hiyo's georgia pie delta 8 thc cart with the cannabis derived terpenes here's the cart itself you know not the packaging or anything like that we do have point three percent of delta nine and thc contained in this i will be putting the uh percentage of delta eight thc on the screen on the screen sorry uh but yeah let's go ahead and take a hit and uh let's talk about it guys i know you guys might have seen the first impression a little clip i had so you guys already know i'm a big fan of this flavor cheers y'all thank you for joining me on yet another video review cheers [Music] you know we got to do a blinker for the first hit that's customary so yeah delta a is kind of more known as the more harsh cannabinoid comparatively to cbd and delta 9. but this is pretty smooth and i'd say it's still much smoother than the rogue river labs car i take a blinker from a rogue river labs cart and i am dead the flavor here is great i think they got a good mix of terpenes in here now i'm not sure um if all the delta eight thc cards from sky high are gonna taste the same i'm going to assume as of this point in time no but that is you know a common theme with some brands guys you know raw garden sublime smokeland certain delta eight brands they they all kind of sometimes use a similar tert blend so that kind of makes all their strains kind of taste the same to me this doesn't i don't think it is like that but yeah going on to the taste it's very very sweet kind of almost like a peach sweet you know like a picnic when you have a cup of peaches in syrup you know like the you know the to-go things uh to go fruit bowl things that you can get in a snack container or a lunchables or something so i'm kind of getting that level of sweetness from this not too much else maybe a little bit of pineness but that's about it there the potency on this thing is pretty nice just you know going off my previous experience of having some of it yesterday and a little bit of it today you know i i like the hot we're getting a nice head high there which kind of normally goes standard i think for delta 8 thc it normally starts with a little head high that kind of pulls you back in a sense like it feels like the back your head is is is is going backwards in a sense like you know like i said like look a little pullback i couldn't find any straight uh strain info you know about the cross of georgia pie but the strain itself is a seed junkie genetics cross so you know if you guys know seed junkie genetics that guy's making some of the best fire around you know the homie freddy has some of his genetics as well that is you know growing up so this is really good stuff um strain wise strain why so i'm probably going to go ahead and look into uh seed junkie and see if i could figure out the georgia pi uh cross yeah i'm enjoying the dirt profile on this you know like i said really peachy kind of flavor almost like that syrupy kind of pizza a little fruit bowl thing so i'm going to take another hit here see if we can get this high a lot more potent see what else i might be feeling off this thing cheers y'all [Music] i gotta say guys this is really one of the most impressive d8 cards i've had honest i am super impressed with this thing like the flavor is done very well nice and smooth and it's almost to the point where um you know if it weren't for the color i would barely able be able to tell that the difference between this and a delta nine thc car you know potency wise of course you can always tell the difference you know but if you're someone who doesn't smoke that much this is going to be great for you honestly like if if you can't handle any delta 9 thca all that stuff delta 8 and cbd is most likely going to be the route for you and if you want the closest thing to that psychoactive high of delta nine go ahead i definitely recommend delta eight let's take one more hit here guys uh but potency wise pretty good setting in a little bit more um the head high is not getting as intense as i thought it would um after hitting it again it's actually kind of not flowing a little bit more downwards um i'm feeling my back is feeling actually really good now now that i think about it um not now i was gonna say this i'm gonna preface this was saying this this is it's not stronger than delta nine to me to me you know if i took a dab of uh let's let's say these bear labs guava fake diamonds right if i took a dab of this is it's completely gonna overwrite whatever this is you know if i take a blinker of my sublime ceramic cart you know this this is probably gonna overwrite this you know i'm gonna take two blinkers of this this is gonna get me probably a little bit more higher than this will but that's okay guys you know this is not supposed to be beating delta nine you know it's supposed to be an alternative to that so let's take another hit yo but yeah this is uh one of the best ones i've had so far i can't wait to try the other uh sky hill carts i have here you know we got cereal milk and white runs to go so very very very excited for those strains and you know these strains aside from the georgia pie actually are strains i've had in real life so i could probably make a better uh distinction between them or something hopefully hopefully thank you guys for watching up to this point you know and if you have not drop a like for the homie drop a little comment let me know what you are smoking on and which of these three strains sounds more appealing to you man the georgia pie the cereal milk the white ones man which one would you get and if you have been enjoying and not been subscribed please hit that subscribe button it's for the free skis man and the nerdy bill is too so you know you hit both of those you're going to know when i'm i upload when i live stream all that stuff you know i want to have a more ironed out concrete schedule again i mean i feel like a lot of people just kind of forget the schedule sometimes so i'll probably talk about it a lot more and try to make a more considerate effort to push it out there cheers everybody thanks for coming through with them good vibes as always [Music] so [Music] three blinkers in like less than five minutes that's about less than ten minutes is that definitely gonna hit you but that's about it for this review guys taste wise right this is completely peachy you know i'm not really getting much of anything else just a really nice deep sweetness the terps here are fantastic man great job to sky ohio you know really good mix of terp and oil and potency-wise not too bad at all for a delta eight cartridge i honestly think that this is gonna be one of my favorites so far especially because of the flavor um but yeah if you guys are wondering how it stacks up to the ruger for labs potency-wise i do think that the wedding cake and black lime were just a tad bit stronger than this but we'll see how that cereal milk and white runs do and all that but so far very very satisfied with sky ohio and another thing guys is you should try to order all your delta eight before the march 27th ban um uh they're going to be banning delta eight being shipped in you know in packages through the usps and all that stuff um pretty soon the usps is though kind of reconsidering it so if you guys do want to buy delta 8 for the future or do want to help the people who are trying to keep this thing legal in you know the mail then please go google that the usps is uh like i think i think there's a form or an org you can join i i believe but yeah just go ahead and google that up and you know fight the good fight if that's what you want to do but thank you guys for tuning in and watching i hope you guys come back for another video or a live stream or something like that i do enjoy it when i see all these familiar faces and new faces in the streams and comment sections and all that so thank you guys for joining me take one last little puff here yeah go with good vibes everybody and have a great day night afternoon whatever time it may be yeah pizza out peace you", "oovH1YDaw40": "welcome back welcome back welcome back to our [ __ ] hey [Music] hmm all right child welcome back to another video but the video is gonna be a quick one because we just had to try this we keep seeing it everywhere in our town y'all let us know the shit's everywhere bro yeah like let us know if it's everywhere god's out too because this [ __ ] is is going through fast i'm seeing it literally everywhere but it's called cake and it's a little disposable and right off back it looks like the cookies logo which so they they kind of stole that yeah they did and the cookies does a little print they stole they they completely stole the cookies look but how i feel is delta a and delta nine is like delta nine big brother delta a little brother or maybe a little sister ain't number one in that sense like cookies is d9 and cake his d.a like cookie's a cake nah that's how i took you yeah he didn't like it he didn't like i ain't got a lot it's it i don't really have a problem with it no more because it's kind of like damn burner you ain't got a [ __ ] delta eight out yet so

it says on the bags got a little oh it was collected on december 16 2020. it's got the qr code on the back and everything the batch that this was made from was only 14 grams so you literally got one of 14 grams that was made for this that's pretty cool it's got a little cake seal i kinda like that crack this [ __ ] open got this love hate relationship i do i do it's a real love hey y'all don't

heard nothing but good things about this oh it's the sticker i've heard nothing about good things everybody keeps saying how good it is and they had two different boxes for some reason one box was solid and then it was this yes and it was like the box like this is what a box like these was all like a cake line yeah and then the red box was like the other flavors and [ __ ] yeah but so far i kind of like the packaging though it's it's winning you over so we got [ __ ] this this trash now and i want to go ahead and say kate does not know we're doing a review on them no we just [ __ ] we gotta keep up with our subscribers [ __ ] is talking about it so we got to get it regardless if they [ __ ] with us i kind of like how it looks no lie it's got the clear windows on the side of it it's pretty cool i like that okay it's got a charging port so if you do find yourself low you'll be able to charge that [ __ ] up a little seal like the top is rubber right now it ain't yeah it's plastic it's a little look a little bit more a little rubber fits it better other ones you see and i got three little mouth holes i like that that's cool like a harmonica at the top now the texas pound cake i've never tried texas pound cake anything but you know it's crazy hold on though they cake starts with a c but the disposables got a k on it see okay let me see the box that's a little weird maybe they got the disposables made by somebody else just didn't have their logo on it well when you look up cake we tried to find that actual like company and get in contact with them to see if they wanted to work with us it was hard to even find anything about them everybody that sell these are like third-party sellers they're not coming from a direct site so when we look down there that was a thing you can see on the metal of gas stations yeah a lot of gas stations that's mainly we're already off back okay disposables i have some other disposables you pull it out it's literally just a plastic container like a little plastic square and some wires connected to it that's it this [ __ ] is like a real cart if you look on the inside you see the same filter and [ __ ] as a cart yeah you do so this is like i don't know if y'all gonna be able to see that [ __ ] yeah you're not gonna be able to see that that's the window but the window it's got an actual [ __ ] little piece of the metal [ __ ] stem like on the carts yeah all right so see what this tastes like he'll be [ __ ] me up when [ __ ] ain't got buttons oh what's that to look uh action was that satisfaction have you that's what you ain't answering me have you tasted texas pound cake no that tastes good oh it tastes sweet yeah it's like it tastes like a dessert yeah this is good and it it it's heavy you hit it hit you in the

"3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "gxI2kv27MDs": "yo yo mister he's a keeper these I'm gonna stop some green today we're gonna take a couple of dabs of some super Lemon Haze Oh Shi check it out yo what is it concentrate Supply Company cannabis extract the THC herbal Center that's where I got it from this is some nug run yeah let's take the look all right this actually has 62 percent THC a but you actually get you a psychoactive you know feeling and the Thu percentage is 17 so [ __ ] some fire and I actually well my girlfriend actually found my camera charger so that I can actually do some pretty good close-ups if that didn't work imma go ahead stand up and give you a right well what you really want to see okay so here's the back of the bag the chasey a stage of 2.5 percent THC is 17.7% that there's no CBD

share I feel like you say it too but until next time I'm trees Cheers", "bVbyjvDRmGE": "[Music]", "Nh-EENnqR8o": "hello senior Thunder fan this is the real seniors running back at you for a cool review of a new product that just bought cause it's called the picket the picket one kit and what the picket one is is it's a twist snapping and Hale product that basically uses your existing 510 cartridge and it's an auto inhale function with a button has 660 mah total battery life smart power modes of medium high and low and it's machined from a solid block of aluminum one year warranty from Pickett vapor let's open it up unbox it and take a look comes nicely packaged solidly tucked in here now I'm always very impressed with packaging there's now companies and people that specialize in packaging because to save the money of shipping they find ways to put a lot into a small box so here's our Pickett the unit the warranty card our instruction manual and we have a magnetic a case of magnetic adapters to to choose from I believe one is for 0.5 bill and one is for a 1 a micro USB cable and your cartridge let's open up the cartridge because what I'm going to do for you well today is show you how to fill one this is the cartridge I'm gonna be using a nice heavy but it's cartridge definitely you can tell it's a piece of material here let's take a look at the picket what a simple device very simple looking device and I see it has a button but it also uses the draw the picket the purple pivot one let's put the Box aside take out the magnetic adapters take a look at those because we're gonna need those if we're gonna use a cartridge get two of them a large and a small don't want to lose those adapters keep them in the box it's a five click on and off three prism colored blinks will happen press it hold and alternately you can do auto inhale using the cartridges it's called twist snap and inhale magnetic adapter and then put it through okay so here's what we're going to do we're going to take a magnetic adapter this looks like a large cartridge so I'm sure it's based on the length of the cartridge the size of the cartridge whether it's a one gram or a half a gram cartridge and then this would be the magnetic piece that holds on to it that's opposite let's see what happens when we put it in directly you know what this must be the card that excuse me the magnetic pieces are four cartridges you buy the cartridge I'm using is a cartridge that came with it that I bought go along with the unit and it's a self filling cartridge what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to show you how to fill it we open the cartridge by turning the mouthpiece counterclockwise to expose this part then what I do will take a cigarette lighter and I warm the glass i've warm the glass by the way the very very big cartridge just gonna hold a lot of stuff and then I take my syringe after I've warmed the glass and put it right up against it and start shooting it down then you can see how it drips you are watching here you can see it drip down sometimes you need to heat it up a second time but it seems to be going down well I'm very pleased here it's filling the entire cartridge the syringe should equal the cartridge in terms of what it consists of a little bit less than the syringe so I'm gonna say this 0.8 in this cartridge because the syringe is a full gram then you take your top of your cartridge and turn it clockwise to close it back on top now there might be a little residue don't worry about that little residue in this case unfortunately I don't have anything to wipe it on so I'm going to wipe it on just a piece of sticky note you're all gonna jump up and down about that because it's worth money take it easy I'm just doing this to make the video go smooth here okay now you have a cartridge that's spilled in it goes magnetically attached one two three four five I've hit my button I have the flashing purple light let's take a draw let's try to get the temperature up here we go well let's talk about this device as compared to some of my others most of my others are the traditional size of a vape pen the Wang batteries that look like the sticks this is heavier but it's very concealable extremely concealable this is not gonna stick out and show a tip of a vape pen so if you're in a concert but you need to go somewhere and you want to take discrete dabs this is a Blue Dream 100% it's my distiller that I use and I decided to make it non fruit flavor at this one let's take another cake very solid it's a piece of machinery I can tell you that this is truly magnetic it's gonna keep the cartridge in in discreet I like the concept I like the weight it's really different but strong strong like my vessel so for the picket the picket one this is the picket one I want to make sure I use the right terminology for what this is this is the picket one kit twist snap and inhale I filled my cartridge with blue dream this is the battery for it it's a push or air activated and I really like it so this is the real senior stoner back at you with the picket one welcome to my arsenal", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and

but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I don't know thanks for watching brothers and sisters leave me a comment let me know what you think you like the strain you try to before you don't like the strain let me know why you don't like it you think I'm right think I'm wrong I read all your comments I reply to them all I love it while you're here click Subscribe I'm going to be making videos all the time might as well be the first one to see them so till next time I hope you're all taking staying safe taking care of each other and above all everyone keeps smoking", "q7dowCeZCa8": "to follow down like what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another cartridge video and it's a it's a friend that I've tried like two three years ago when I like started getting into cartridges it is the Blum brand you know saying all that good stuff but it is their life resin yeah so like I said I'm not the first person to do this I've seen some videos online but I am gonna do my own rendition of a video you know I'm saying but as you can see it says live resin hundred percent cannabis no additives all that good good stuff and as you can see it is galactic check and I like to mention that this is the first time me blazing today so it is technically going to be a wake and bake so you know saying let's just continue on so we got Delta 9 THC I believe it's running at 71 point seven four percent and I believe there's also some THC a I think 13 percent yeah 13 percent just in case you guys can't see we're going in for a little bit any guys good [ __ ] alright and also this was tested by canna safe by us thicker so how you tell that most of the time when you get something legit they're gonna have a sticker separate from the packaging like it's another sticker that they put on that's the the testing sticker that they put on but as you can see tested by canna safe I actually could not go on I didn't go on there being I couldn't find the test results but I heard canna safe is a really really legitimate company testing company so we're just gonna take their word for it big oil also does the stuff for I believe Bear labs so that's pretty interesting but it says contains no additives PG VG or vitamin e acetate I mean it has a CBD and CBN but minuscule minuscule so let's open this get my trusty lighter bro you guys don't know what the light of bro is I'm excited whoo my breast this is only $40 I have the receipt guys so I have them see here see out the door so is 29 but then you add the tax so about 40 dollars total I would say positive s but I bought it last minute all that good stuff the bloom break it's a very raw garden esque look very light fairly light in here sorry about that guys so push this yes definitely this is library I'd be a lot darker no blue thumbnail here this is a raw garden part basically this new [ __ ] laughing jack I get freaky by the way this is the death bait retro if you guys haven't seen that video already very very dope battery cheese boys let's turn that up a bit so they recommend 3.5 voltage so let's just try that but very similar to raw cardoon Wow it's cheaper to buy like five books it's a very lemony taste as you would assume from galactic Jack right but very very raw garden esque I would say very very good I like it like if I took this hit and I looked at the cartridge I would have thought its raw garden to be honest that's crazy cheers boys damn it the taste is there it's like I'm just looking sucked on a lemon ooh not gonna lie I'm very impressed you know for something to be of quality of raw garden five dollars cheaper you really can't go wrong with it it's a different brand you know so I had to try it bloom form the other strains that they had were also sativa so I'm probably just gonna assume that they tasted very similar to each other but as far as this brand goes or this live resin cartridge both very very good it's a lot lighter than your typical live resins very reminiscent of raw garden so I mean if you like rock garden you're gonna love this but like if you're looking for that dark type of [ __ ] this isn't like if it doesn't matter to you you know the color of the the live resin or whatever and this is good you know 40 I believe I paid 40 exactly for this so it's definitely not bad you know there's buddies that cost 42 there's select that costs 45 raw garden that costs 45 this $5 cheaper in and the same quality of raw garden I believe so uh yeah pretty a pretty high in THC 280 three point six three you take one more hit for you and I will probably get an end the video I'm probably gonna blow it out there to see just to show you how much smoke we actually get so cheers boys all right there you have it yourself get out of your head out of your mind going flying don't forget what I said keeping a lot of shits are so good out of your head adding a mind-blowing I don't forget what I said I found all of you still having doubts now like how it the distance is so wait yo and the drone waiting for some booze back by my time [Music]", "yquXaQ_EohA": "of YouTube what up YouTube welcome back welcome back king Luke 4:20 here coming at you

got a nice deep sleep this one is one of my favorite pens it tastes so amazing it tastes like a lick one of them orange creamsicle ice creams it is good super mellow high smoke it's pretty heavy on the lungs compared to some of the other ones I don't mind that the flavors really good I actually did a review on the flower of this it was probably the highest THC that I've had from truly y'all want to check it out I'll put a link in the top but yeah this is good stuff if they pens all your thing and you like sweet stuff like I said this one's got like an orange vanilla taste to it it's amazing

think it medical-marijuana critic here today how are you thank you for joining me and as always it's nice to see you today I'm testing another product from the folks over at their player this is the ther plant cape de plume t21 to 2505 all about to say it's East Coast Sour Diesel cross with enter in a s and it's a vape pen refill now somebody forgot to plug in this vape pad battery so I'm just gonna have to do it through my rage but right now if you're not familiar with the strange not a problem I have you covered East Coast our diesel is a fast-acting attitude lifter that patients love for it's truly sativa effects the strain has a sour lemons smell and the taste that's crisp uplifting east coast Sour Diesel is powerful so new patients should be cautious those looking to alleviate anxiety or get some sleep skip this because it will lift you up you've heard me talk about the fuzzies and the feelings are getting the body the heavy ninety and stuff like that well that's what this will do if you do it to excess now entering his tangerine Hayes is a sativa dominant hybrid that's treasured for its distinct citrus smell and taste this cologne only sativa originated in the Netherlands with the union of g13 haze and then New York City Diesel and since its popularity has spread all over Canada Colorado a West Coast zesty tangerine aroma accented with floral notes may be the hallmark of the string but it's elevated stress relieving effects are also cherished by patients and recreational consumers tangerine haze is a top choice for daytime enjoyment as its effects stimulate the mind and allow functionality for the growers out there there's a recommendation sixty-five days for the flowering period for tangerine haze that way of citrus flavor is peak right now breakdown on this particular piece we have not see GHC 140 2.04 of milligrams THC a at 69 point six eight milligrams CBD is 0.1 milligram CBD a one point three four milligrams CBG at four point zero two milligrams CBG a at two point six eight milligrams cbn at one point three floor milligrams cbc at two point six eight milligrams and then we wrapping this particular one up with THC v of one point three four milligrams I'll show you what we have I had my camera set but of course it went into sleep mode very nice it's white again this is supposed to be for a vape pen so it's very very runny as you can see but it will work for what I want to do today - gift owers definitely has the tangerine to it that's nice excuse me after the tape then it didn't hit me my chest it's not expanding me it's not breaking me or making me cough I do slightly CL it to the head already here on the sides the regular sativa area nice nice give it a try people see what you think Thera plant state in a plume t 212 2505 east coast Sour Diesel cross retired renames okay", "Fe3b9S-SibI": "hey guys this afternoon testing out the arrow pro blue dream cartridge came in at 90 percent THC and been hitting this out for a little while I'm gonna say good flavor it's not as flavorful as some of the other arrow Pro cards that I've had but it is very strong the 90 percent each key obviously shows here but TV percentage isn't everything as I would say that I think some of the mountain mists that I've gotten have been a little bit stronger than this one still overall a great quality cartridge and can't complain I mean it's way better than most cards out there but it's not the strongest of the strongest arrow pro but it's still really really good and here is a take a hit of it so AeroPro if you're not familiar with it they use their own type of battery and that battery has a different type of connection so it's an automatic lead magnetic connection there is no threading it fits nice the battery when you hit it AeroPro batteries vibrate while you hit them and how you tell when the battery is dying is as it's degrading dying you'll start vibrating like when it's done hitting then you'll feel another vibration that means the battery's starting to go out there's different ranges different vibrations it does for how much percentages laughs there's three of them and we'll post that in our arrow pro review that information but overall two thumbs up cartridge tastes pretty good and effects are pretty awesome it's a great strength not the absolute strongest arrow Pro cartridge this blue dream but a great card nonetheless and definitely one of the better cartridges out there thanks for watching guys as Dow connection and have a great week [Music]", "JVvjqk9nMJI": "you know what is going on guys today [ __ ] you would think after [ __ ] years I would have a different intro I hate seeing that but getting in front of camera is like really awkward for me still test now this new

skirting my way out of [ __ ] Idaho back to the hometown Seattle where Lee ro weed is legal so I don't get no more [ __ ] trouble here been in way too much trouble lately with the law first strain ever invented and it was because this dude grew in Alaska and like Aurora lights you know the Northern Lights in Alaska went over the weed and weed before this was never a green it was always red grown by Mexicans but when this dude drew it in Alaska with the aurora lights it turned green for the first time so he called it the Northern Lights and the second ever strain was alaskan thunder [ __

phone [ __ ] hitting the dab pen I totally [ __ ] forgot about the video I was just getting stoned sitting here um anyways let's move on wait let me take another rip I'm gonna give this a score 1 out

other ones up to the first one was honestly the best I want to give the first one like a nine now I don't know what I gave it before but it probably wasn't the [ __ ] nine wedding Paiwan [ __ ] me up also wedding pie is the only door cord all right end result Northern Lights nine wedding pie 7.5 bubba kush hmm probably an 8 probably an 8 this one is fruity pebbles or Strawberry Cough honestly I've lost so many [ __ ] cards I don't know which flavor is which okay is smaller this one was more expensive this was a little cheaper just because I got it on a sale at the dispensary all right boys that's been the [ __ ] video I'm going to turn this camera off and sleep actually it's Sunday so I'm gonna watch the football game Packers are on in three hours let's go I almost forgot to do one more red", "XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance

of the review but Blue Dream it's my all-time favorite I can't go wrong with blue tree", "uwqTulYZiYU": "what's good with y'all was good shawn [ __ ] today i'm back with another little video and [ __ ] and i was a little excited for this one so i already opened this [ __ ] and [ __ ] like i'm not gonna count to y'all cause i didn't even think i mean i wasn't excited well i was excited but i didn't think i was going to make a video on a big cheat because i made a video on like hella big chiefs and [ __ ] right but i guess i haven't done blue dream i've known one of the new flavors only wedding cake and that was it bro so yeah today i got a little blue dream we're about to see what this does real quick my battery's been charging for like a solid 15 minutes and that [ __ ] was dead earlier let's see if that [ __ ] could like last through the video bro if that [ __ ] don't last through the video y'all might have to [ __ ] end this [ __ ] and [ __ ] restart it bro i swear and i'll be so heated but yeah we're off the ooze battery it's just looking pretty slick i'm not gonna count to you oh yeah this is blue dream by the way dry hip off the dry head it's tasting it gives me that same taste that every big cheese well it's like that distillate like the distillate that big chief uses is what i'm getting first but i also get a bud flavor this one's like lemony i don't know if i'm tripping but i'm getting like a sour taste off this we'll see off the off off a real hair real quick off a hard hit well my ac is on by the way so if y'all see my ghost going everywhere and [ __ ] i'm sorry bro usually i have some on point ghost because i always turn my ac off before the videos but bro i don't know what but my ac went up to 80 [ __ ] so i had to like lower that [ __ ] down with [ __ ] as [ __ ] so we're just gonna stay on bro if i close my van it's gonna get hot as [ __ ] damn i've had a big chief in a minute bro but i forgot how much smackers these were hey for a minute though these used to smack me more than stizzy's bro i swear bro i don't know if i was on one or what but these used to smack i don't know if they still do it well but the last time i tried these i said in my video that they smack me more than sissies and i know these aren't certified likes these are but hold on i know these aren't certified like stizzies aren't [ __ ] that's why i try not to do a lot of reviews on big cheese and [ __ ] that's why i try to get a lot of like whoa these are bomb these are still some good ass wags don't get me [ __ ] wrong boys this is still some fire but it's just not state certified bro it's not certified like styzias well at least i don't think it is bro because i thought these [ __ ] got raided last time by the cops and they shut down like the [ __ ] factory i think but yeah stacy has their license and [ __ ] they don't that's why i have that's why i really been holding back on the big chief videos and [ __ ] because a lot of people hate on them they get views and [ __ ] because a lot of people can get their hands on these right and they're still doesn't fire bro like this is some of the most fire [ __ ] you can get your hands on if you're gonna so all right if you want to smoke bro and you want to for sure get high bro not no scam [ __ ] get you a big cheap bro big chiefs if you get a legit big chief you're gonna get high every time bro don't try any other product other than big chief if you want to get higher it's cause like they sell a lot of fake [ __ ] around my area the plugs do so that's why i try to like if i [ __ ] try something and it's good i stick with that you know like i don't like to like switch brands a lot because a lot of the [ __ ] that they be putting out there bro i don't really know bro and it's real [ __ ] even with the big cheese like you don't know what they put in these and [ __ ] bro but there's still some gas that's why i try not to smoke on these as much bro that's why i've been getting a lot of stizzies selects i gotta select that's why i just been trying to get certified [ __ ] my bad if i'm doing a lot of talking i'm achieving real quick my bad for that that was my speaker y'all it was just turning down these are two vicious hey keep in mind y'all i usually chief every day bro i usually chief every day right but i haven't cheated for like a day and a half because i ran out of my stitches i'm wearing a cap and i just haven't been cheating it because i haven't had nothing to achieve on yeah so that's why i caught the little big cheek but damn hey i'm not in light i'm feeling a little a little lit right now i don't know if it's a head high or what but i think i'm feeling that head high because i don't feel nothing body body wise but yeah bro take a look at this wax real quick y'all [ __ ] is not moving bro that's just how big chief is though big chiefs always had some good like slow wax you know this is i've been smoking on big cheese for almost more than a year now bro more than a year now bro i'm not like you real big cheese bro i don't think i've ever smoked a fake one on my life i don't think i ever smoked a fake [ __ ] i did real [ __ ] it but yeah um damn i forgot all these things bro i'm too [ __ ] lit this is just tasting fire though i'm not gonna lie to you let me just keep ripping this that blue jean bro the blue dream from stizzy oh my gosh hold on now that i actually think of it this has like kind of like barely that blue dream taste barely any of it bro like barely any of it instead with the sticky puds you get more of like that sweeter taste with this you barely get any sweetness and a lot more bud but it's still some fire bro regardless i think it's because dizzy they add um fake um terpenes and they added fake terpenes in every car [ __ ] am i talking about but i think they add like um sugar chip i mean [ __ ] flavored terpenes like um sweet flavored terpenes in this disney's more that's probably why but damn we got one little bubble and i've been ripping it pretty decent bro i'm not gonna lie to you i'll be ripping this pretty good and we only got one little bubble that's why i like big chips though because these are like a good price bro you could get a [ __ ] for 35 40. some people sell them for 30. it just depends bro but in general b chiefs aren't that expensive at for a gram bro and these lasts these last bro these [ __ ] lies damn well yeah i think that's the end of this video y'all i'm gonna just keep chiefing i don't know if y'all wanna watch me just keep like i'm [ __ ] zoned out bro i don't haven't had a [ __ ] i think it's just because i switched to [ __ ] bro it's because when you smoke the same [ __ ] all the time like you keep smoking stizzy bro and you switch i feel like if you switch over to a big chief that shit's gonna hit you harder i'm feeling like my mind's [ __ ] everywhere you know like i can't it's hard for me to put these words together right now well it's not hard for me but it feels kind of challenging and [ __ ] but yeah i think that's it bro i'm gonna just end it off right there get some gas [ __ ] with big chief", "ALNziWDRN2E": "you were a boy again another video and today we're reviewing the blue Hey so we're gonna be on blue haze I'm gonna tell you how this feels the effects and just like the smell the taste and everything yo yo yo I got a plan here to sew on some little parts right here but smoking but should be smokeable it is like comment subscribe turn on Abdul notifications show some love some support I show love back and people like let's try to get a 50

buy and they say fire fire do this we just sold dance I want to say it's about two grams in here I almost forgot to review the week all right guys look so this right here has a beautiful smell oh it's strong the smell is strong man the bud is frosty oh man so yeah I've seen that already but let me just show you I wish I could see if my taste my but my taste buds there you go are like whack I know when a weed hits like a certain way like the south or just the flavor that leaves behind this one it could either be the Duchess I smoke because I tried a new Java champ not the new ones this is new to me because I already smoked those and I mean it kind of let the good taste and on the rap like really the bread left a good taste but the we good taste like what I hate it right now it tastes a little strong but anything bad but anything good you know mmm this is a I did make a little research I'm like I'm gonna tell y'all I know this for a fact I just this is just on top of my head I remember eyeful reading this I always leave it the information are pletely in the description so go read that go read that like it see it's all India if you need more information it's all in there but um it's like a sativa dominant obviously it's a hybrid it's a cheap Adame good for like you know getting chilled out relaxed but also as a day time we do you know isn't a time strain you can take it day time anyone like have you knocked out and [ __ ] but you don't have your relaxed relaxed you'll be chilly damn we taught minutes in and we all looked over but it usually takes me about 30 minutes about to take 16 I say all these time but the times don't really stay on the video because you know it gets edited it gets cut out 7-eleven should like let me do it out for them or not bad but I sponsor me I'll be like go to 7-eleven and get your new hot chocolate median size for just $1.99 I think it's probably I'm already [ __ ] them I can't do it easily but I'll be like welcome to the new cafe where you can smoke weed and drink your latte no I mean like I actually do ads for their life with this mask on [Music] from one to ten how high do you think I am look you started your pout lovely there you go definitely how high but my reasonable bees we don't smooth the whole thing that is blue dream let me talk about the effects the low kill forget about well let me tell you how it feels to be honest the highest so pan instead the way that I cubed is like I feel the hair change I know I'm highest but I'm faded issue I can feel them higher [ __ ] the citizens it's so balanced it's just like it feels normal you know but your mood is definitely so like chill down as you can't see but you know you can stay focused on what you're doing if you made it this far common something coming up a number of the minutes or seconds you're just comment the number minutes or seconds you're at like policy like wherever you want boom Posse you know or post it whenever you want and still watching your voice really [ __ ] fading right now so we would like for that comment subscribe if you have ready to watch it - right here then you know in the comment section that you watched the whole video yeah man show some of those so some support I appreciate it I'll see you guys on a nice video and I am out", "ivRTpxFMtmE": "so what's going on guys we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on another kart the venom X this one is the pomegranate paradise sativa so with uh with that intro already done let's go ahead and let you guys know that this channel is a smoking cannabis channel only so if you're not 21 and older 18 and 21 depending on your state you can't watch this video it's age restricted or some some some I don't know I don't know YouTube doing me dirty with this but sorry so well now we can start the review like I said so it's the pomegranate paradise it's the venom X this is the first venom X we've reviewed on the channel I did like a week or two ago have two venom X's they were actually the same exact one they were supposed to be different but the girl gave me the same ones for some reason so that was whatever but I just didn't make a video and I explained why in another video so go watch that one um but this one I don't think it says anything about like what percent it is oh no it does this is meeting with 100% all-natural terpenes C cell technology but bought 85% - you see right there in the middle marade there we got it on the doctor's odx battery here it's pretty well charged when I was when I got this it was supposed to be like really fruity that was supposed to be the flavor like a fruity kind of earthy taste but after hitting it for like the last few hours like a day like I've had for a day I notice that it's very very cush it's just straight clutch taste so if you like those go for it but the high on this thing is probably the happiest ha I think I've ever gotten out of any car especially or out of any sativa especially any card this thing just smacked me like in a good way and I was like fully chilling the whole time but I just felt really good I was in some good vibes you know I'm saying so I got like hair they're mangroves if you guys like sativas um and you really want to get like a really good happy high like feel great moment I highly recommend this car venom X pomegranate paradise it is solid for that I haven't felt that that like great high in a long time and this one definitely did it so let's go ahead and take one one good couch off this bad boy and yeah let me know if you guys are smoking anything down in the comments melesa interested to know so twos guys yeah I mean it I I will say there is like a little bit of a fruity taste maybe like pomegranate maybe a small hint of it but it's very cushy maybe a small hint of erythema like that that like weird you know the taste I don't want to say it's earthy but that's how everybody describes it but y'all know what the taste is but it has a little bit of those too but it's mainly cush to me that's at least my personal taste you guys might taste a little something different right sorry to me here like little noises in the back I just got a puppy I'm fostering and he's a little Brad so it makes a lot of noise I mean when yeah this thing's I'm already feeling a little little hot and body I already for sure head high a little a little bit I'm gonna feeling chill you don't here's the wax it's a really nice golden color beautiful background huh 10 out of 10 it is pretty solid they're pretty thick pretty damn thick no there was a deal it was a to 440 the homie uh-uh he the big the big homie got ice play with me so we went 20 20 and he got a cart shoutouts to him you got the same cart and I don't know how to say let's just shoot you another one guys cuz that's all I can say Oh yo so real quick so it's October right Oh in September Jesus Christ but it's September so it's almost Halloween to you that means that Halloween serials in season Nash it's the best so let me know which one's your favorite there's like Count Dracula or whatever the chocolate one a cocoa dragon track you cannot what it's called there's Franken berry and then Boo Berry let me know which one's your favorite I'm personally a Franken berry I think Don's left I think I was like tops for sure and then boo Berryman choco vampire [ __ ] whatever told mm-hmm but that's just me that's just me those are some bomb-ass cereals oh for sure for sure well well [ __ ] there is a little bubble right there and one thing I have noticed after hitting it when you do create a bubble like that inside the card it kind of hits off that bubble again so you kind of get like the weird battery like fume taste so it's kind of ideal if you can let the bubble move a bit that would be I that would be a bad deal but if not you know you can still get a pretty decent draw off it for sure for sure well let's take another one you choose yeah you know what I want to do for you guys I want to do a for one of the strings Saturdays or screen Sundays or whatever it is his move his battery's getting all my little one well for one of the streets after it is do like a Keith pre-roll or something like that like a full like Granberry Keith line or like a 3.5 grant that would be dope the I I'm not really ever smoked a chief joint at all I don't even know if Keith blunts it really made it often but I'm more of a joint kind of guy anyway but definitely man wow my lungs right there I definitely really want to smoke occasionally they look so fired or a moon rock a Zodiac moonwalk one of those those pre-rolls are expensive but I'm definitely found if you guys lend me one and see one of those I gotta find a dispro that hassle near me but I'm sure that'll be pretty damn easy I think that was three is that three yeah well I think yeah here she I'll kind of show you there's the bubble right it's just it got bigger it didn't like Oh to any other one I don't really know if he can do that maybe if I switch switch it a little bit if I open it a little bit more like not so tight no I'm saying it might be blocking a little bit of airflow let's see well I wasn't I feel like a lot more smoke and normal for sure Richard Oh ma'am that was interesting I don't know if I that was a good good idea or what I just I've always had it pretty tight so I just kind of loosened it so there's like a little bit more air fall but enough connection to get a hit yeah definitely hearing more air flow going through for sure well what interesting I'm gonna mess around with that a little more see how that works and see what happens there but I think that's a wrap for this video guys I hope you guys had a Wow Jesus Christ I am stupid I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did go ahead and give me a like or subscribe that would be awesome comments are always dope I always reply to all of them you guys are super dope on all the last ones you guys pretty much left comments on every single one except for like one which is totally chill for me but yeah I love to love the feedback so it's always good to hear with all that done and like for kids there's on them feeling feeling a real nice here real nice so I'm probably gonna put on some music by about some games or you know YouTube whatever maybe but yeah I'll see you guys in the next one deuces have go", "9PeerRbdRjI": "[Music] [Music] good morning your esteemed members of Parana I am Anita Matthew the host for 30 minute thank you so much compassion and to see anything in joining us

Vasudevan to the session before I hand over to dr. Basu Devin a quick note for the attention of all the participating members during the course of this webinar your voice will be muted any questions that you might have could be posted in the comment box which is located in the right hand side of your screen at the end of this session dr. Vasudevan will answer them live over to dr. Vasudevan for his insightful presentation thank you and welcome you sir Hurley nice introduction good morning all the candies the present place the whole weight is raining under this pandemic and therefore it is necessary for us to have an idea of what is happening today we are know importantly we will be taking care of their diagnostic features of Comet and the today's topic will be covered something like this initially we will be tending about something on the core with 19 and the virus then work the symptoms of the comet that is the understanding of Epidemiology will also be dealt and then we go in a little more greater detail on the diagnosis the codes of the detection as well as the details of some of the clinical laboratory estimations of the virus and then finally we go to the cytokine storm and the importance of CRP in the clinical condition let us going a little about the corona virus the that is Khalid is that coronavirus disease that is the epidemic is lined in 2019 that is the name is like that it is due to him by a particular Wireless dividers is named as s AR s CEO week - that is previously a few years back we have the source infection and this is a mutated variety of the same virus and that is why it is called number two the source Co V - this is originated in Wuhan China in end of November and early December 2019 the corona virus is in a constitute the subfamily ortho Corona V da and the family of Corona be relay and the other in new dog areas of Rabab area if you feel that these are too much then you just forget these particular means and just remember that they are enveloped viruses with single-stranded DNA genome and a nucleo capsid that is very important to remember that this is an RNA virus and single-stranded RNA virus and the virus has a coat of proteins and the virus as such they have a characteristic club shape the spikes that project from their surface which in the electron micrographs created image reminiscent of the solar corona from which this particular name is derived this regarding whereas the average diameter of the virus particle is around 120 nanometer and inside the envelope there is the nucleo capsid which is formed from the multiple copies of nucleic acid and protein we will be discussing this in protein later on that this is a particular important protein that is presented as a specific protein for this particular virus that n protein and that that is bonded to the cellular stranded RNA genome that which will be sufficient for the on the virus now we go for the symptoms of the disease regarding the people the disease can spread the front person to person through stored up droplets from nose or mouth when the infected person calls or exits that is why we are always telling that it is absolutely necessary to keep the social distance and this is the reason and then how it is transmitted is given in the the other part these small droplets land on surfaces which means any person that touches these surfaces and then their eyes nose and mouth can become infected and therefore it is absolutely necessary to keep distance from person to person a more important remember at the moment is that Nana or unscented an intimate asymptomatic persons many persons infected with the Kazakh 90 will show milder symptoms especially during the first stage of the disease thus you can still catch the disease from an infected person who only as a mere coffin does not feel ill that is very important in the present scenario because out of for all persons that is infected by the virus about the 60 percent of the people are remaining unsympathetic you don't know who who is infected but at the same time these asymptomatic people are infected they can infect the virus to others therefore this is a very important point to keep mind then the symptoms of the disease include tiredness high fever dry cough and of course in the later stages that when the disease goes in the bad shape then there will be difficulty in breathing because at that moment the person will have pneumonia type of difficulties and breathing will be difficult the most common symptoms are shown in the upper part that is the favored 88% dry cough 68 person and fatigue 38 person there are many uncommon symptoms that is given here but in the lower end there the lower end or left side that you can see that there will be vomiting diarrhea etcetera that these are the gastrointestinal diseases usually the symptoms of the or the corona virus is the young in upper and lower respiratory tract but in certain persons about a 5 to 30 percent of the persons there will be some amount of the gastrointestinal tract symptoms also in the right hand side is given severe diseases that can ruin that there will be CNS there will be difficulty in in the lungs pneumonia like symptoms and there will be in DDC decays to weight ability a failure high fever all these things will be them now whatever if you have symptoms if you have symptoms or have been in an infected area that is there is some suspicion then call the designated phone number for your region you will be given a home test over the phone and the you wait or quarantine us er protect others by very gross and mosque support they break the chain the chain champion then finally follow the instructions provided by the doctor and national and local health authorities and paramedical assumes antibiotics do not to work against this coronavirus preventive measures are very important and preventive measures are all of us no no because all the press and TV everything will be giving all these details but just to quickly go through that most important is wash your hands with the are covered based sanitizer or with the soap and water as I had already told that keep a distance of at least one meter between us are very anyone who coughs or sneezes and the third one is try your best not to touch your eyes your nose and at your mouth this is an important point it is statistically speaking it is a rule that every one of us will touch our nose or mouth and over 60 times per day that is a common practice of the human beings but at the same time as I have previously told that day transmission is taking place because of this particular and for that should be carefully noted and then cover your mouth and your nose with your bent elbow or tissue and coughing seek medical attention if you have difficulty in breathing and - and of course follow the directions of your national and local health authorities so who are the suspects these are the patients with acute respiratory illness patient with the epidemiological history patient with the respiratory illness and patient no alternative diagnoses that fully explains the clinical signs and symptoms screening is important and this cleaning less cool facts that is when his epidemiological history and the clinical manifestations regarding the epidemiological history within the last 14 days of symptom onset the patient has a travel history or residence in a location with the community transmission or contact with the probable or confirmed cases and if the cohort the clinical manifestation is come then that I had already described that there will be a respiratory illness characterized by fever and respiratory signs and symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath and now we go to the diagnostic features how to detect the infection as well as the details of the laboratory technology there is currently not cure and in the absence of either proven effective therapy or a vaccine the agnostic testing becomes a valuable tool in the left hand side picture is shown that the virus a sender is introduced into the body that infection is there the most important point to remember that out let us say hundred persons are infected only 40 percent will have the over to disease the other sixty person will not have any clinical manifestations but at the same time they are carriers and therefore they can infect is the Overtoun disease that can be of two types most of them almost all of them 98% of them will be recovered about the one COPO person will have aggressive disease and go to data in the right hand side we have shown that there are different clinical tests and these tests I shall describe in greater detail after some time and these the tests are necessary or useful for the epidemiological surveillance for the initial diagnosis for staging to the disease for elastication for therapeutic monitoring and also later after the recovery period there can be again necessary for the epidemiological surveillance important point to remember is that we are taking through the specimen very correctly in the if the person is infected today within the next seven days there will be rapid multiplication of this virus in the upper respiratory tract therefore at this period that is the initial one week we have to take the dazzle or throat swabs NASA pharyngeal swabs this is absolutely important how to take the specimen is important point that the paralytic paramedic is should be aware of how to take the correct correct way of taking the nasal swabs then the swab is taken and it is transported through the universe of transport 21 the middle of transport medium is used and that is kept at a 2 2 a 2 degree centigrade that his eyes should be dug and in this way we can keep only 72 hours maximum if you want to keep this a specimen more than that we have to keep it - 80 or something like that therefore the specimen collection as well as transportation is absolutely necessary most of the the negative results false negative results will come because of that that this form is taken not only put on the character area or because that the transportation is not correctly this is a very important point to remember even though you do all the test and get a negative result of that that's not that means that something something may be wrong in your specimen collection and transportation now that chart is giving the positivity that if you take bran well I will I will allow wish that 93 percent will be positive and NASA swabs usually of only 63 percent positive this is because the iron vapor thought the specimen is not correctly taken or because the transportation is not correct and therefore it is absolutely necessary to keep these things now I want to show but the last last way that there is blood there you can see that it is only 1% positivity that means blood is you not useful for the testing in the in the the nucleic acid testing the virus that virus testing as such of course blood that can be taken but DC utilized for the testing of the antibody test with which I shall describe in greater detail therefore this is not over in initial phase renewal first one week of the disease the upper respiratory tract is infected and therefore Nantz of pharyngeal swabs are useful at that type and the second part of the disease second that a second week of the disease there will be the the infection will be more in the lower respiratory tract and therefore at that eyebrow go I will Irish blue it will be more useful but at the same time there is a lavish flow it is difficult to take it leaves the hospital administration admission etc we take the diagnosed diagnosis of prophet 90 that this can be divided into two major headings one is the molecule of testing second is the serological testing the molecule testing can either be a the real-time reverse transcriptase pcr and be the lamp at st the serology contestable can be the antibody testing that is IgG and IgM and B the antigen testing I shall go into greater detail of each one of them first we go for the reverse transcriptase PC of trust that is the most commonly done tests at the moment in India this is what we call as the testing the patient is tested and such and such an ascender and we get the positivity etcetera that much the number of persons has been where the positivity etc we can see a each a day in the ad papers and this is the most common test that we are doing at the moment in India that is the rt-pcr RP means that there is a reverse transcription the what is that means that the virus is in army and therefore that RNA has to be I first extracted swamis taken and that virus will be there that virus has to be extracted that RNA is to be extracted first that that needs certain chemicals etc some kids etc and the RNA is is taken that RNA is to be converted to DNA that is what we call as a reverse transcriptase the the RNA to DNA that conversion is called a reverse transcription and that enzyme is called a reverse transcriptase with to help out that and say the converted a our new DNA and this DNA is multiplied two million times then that that that test is called the PCR for full form of PCR is polymerase chain reaction that is the polymerase is the inside that there is a chain reaction that is the DNA is first made in the single-stranded DNA then that is to be made in you further further new DNA is synthesized this is something like a mu a pepper a drop is there and from that we take a corpus by thyroxine yes and one hundred of poppies are taken by the Sphero species this is something like that DNA is made into many many copies and that copy million time copies are taken that is what we call as piece here of course that is PCR machine is required because that this particular technique needs different types of temperature first you have to keep at the 95 degree centigrade for one minute then we have to take it 72 degree centigrade for one minute then again about 86 degree centigrade for one minute like that but there will be the changes of the timing changes of the temperature and that is why it is called cycle that it's a temp cycle temperature cycle are a summation is called that we should is necessary and therefore you can see that there is a lot of work that has to be done for this rt-pcr even though the rt-pcr justify five lectures are given that we take at least three to five hours to do the whole work it is a very time-consuming and person consuming when here the genetic material from the sample is copied and then that copied means the RNA is copied into DNA and then that DNA is come back to the genetic sequence of the original buyer that is the basic principle and most of these artists can take anywhere from a few hours usually three to five by ways that you will take nobody is a rapid Diagnostics error has been coming to be it is not comedic Indian market it is available in certain America etc but anyway that let us forget about this rapid test at the moment the indicia see a basic minimum that we have to do that is the common test that we are doing that a nucleic acid test that we generally take that will take time consuming as well as that takes a lot of instruments a lot of capital investment so the PCR test can't confirm diagnosis or covert nineteen if it would identify two species specific why viral genes if it identifies only one gene then it will produce an inconclusive result and the targets include envelop each gene and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene these are the two James that is the tested here and if more of them are positive then we say that the test is positive now they then there can be three test results that is positive test that means that the patient is positive there is no difficulty in that then it can be a negative result that negative result means that the patient they see either you were pressured sample taking and transportation may be wrong or there may be something wrong in going in the actual testing etcetera we don't know therefore a negative test does not rule out a for a positivity or the patient and then there will be an intermediary it has to be I don't know with the Indigo Co test and in them being same test also should be taken as something like they're treated as something like a positive thing now please this can be very labor-intensive as well as capital-intensive with the severe several stages at which errors may occur between the sampling and analysis therefore the false negatives can occur up to 20% meaning that they are more useful for confirming the disease if the test is positive that means infection is the subtle but a negative result will not rule out they think that is what I want to emphasize at this moment there is only 80 percent specificity even in very Buddha labs and therefore there are so many areas where there can be first positivity can come now I will go to the second type of nucleic acid test that is the chitara gene lamp this is a reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification that is the lamp lamp it is a its full form is lupa mediated isothermal amplification well it is isothermal because in the previous the orders usual PCR which is most commonly done in India at the moment all the PCR tests there are three different types of temperature and that there is a cycler is required in a particular instrument is also required for that a different temperature can be kept at a particular timing and in the new technology the new technology has been brought about by the Chitra Shree throttle Royal Institute of Medical Sciences and the they have developed to this particular technique the lamp technology carries the reaction at the constant temperature that means that particular instrument is not required here it is very simple more economical quicker and confirmatory diagnostic tests for the particular engine I had in the very previous stage I have told the n gene that M gene of the virus is detected and the gene itself two areas of the gene is detected and therefore 100% accuracy is shown in this particular instrument in this particular method the great advantage is that this particular method within 10 minutes the gel detection is possible and of course me that there should be the item idea isolation of the of the gene etcetera is required therefore some total 5 or the or the tests will be less than 2 hours therefore that is a great advantage unless unless a time and great accuracy and a more economical lesser time and make any equipment is also a requirement will be also less the method the procedure or this lamp technology is that the RNA is extracted and then they added the reverse transcriptase enzyme which will convert to the virus RNA into a seed copy DNA cDNA and then we do we add the chemicals for the for the reactions that is the lam protection technology is done that will take only few minutes only and in the as I have told that the end gene and the 2 regions of that will be tested and to that ul the a particular day and that they will absorb will be taken up by the DNA and that there will be fluorescence that if there is silica the virus is originally present there there will be more fluorescent and therefore the quantitation is also possible here of course here also there will be 3 types of results negative in the mediate and positive positive will be corrected that that is positive the patient is having the disease intermediate n de- we will know to roll over to the disease but at the same time that there will be more positivity in this particular case in the right hand side that particular equipment for this fluorescence diagnosis will be there and this is you used by this way throttle Institute that is it is that partnered with a gap a diagnostic that this is now ready for marketing and will be within one week this will be ready for marketing that particular technique has already been okayed by the ICMR and therefore there is no technical problem for the marketing in the PC of Technology the reaction is carried out with a series of alternate in temperature steps or cycles which I had already described whereas in the lamp the amplification is carried out at a constant temperature and does not require the thermal cycler and therefore the technique is very simple very easy and tight elastic time-consuming and the the particular instruments are also very less in this particular case like these are the advantages so they nucleic acid tests are over now coming to the zero lattice now you must have heard the the common process that there will be the quick diagnosis is etc these quick diagnosis is the 0 logical test that this can identify the infection and after the that the patient is recovered the antibodies are generated after a week or code by this time the virus should have created from the system now the 2 points I want to emphasize at this moment one is that the 0 lethal to serve them in the blood whereas in the nucleic acid tests are done in Dakar in the swamps of Iran swabs are taken from the throat etcetera that is the main difference secondly you know ready to test will take only 15 minutes or 20 minutes or something like that that is why they are called a rapid a test or cutest and but at the same time there is a difficulty please remember that this serological tests will be positive only after two weeks or one week or 10 days or 15 days after the infection that means the initial phase of the infection we cannot detect by this arrow logical test sorry it is not yet clear how long immunity period after the Corwin 15 infection will turn out to me people who survived in the 2003 sudden acute respiratory syndrome that is the original source outbreak and antibodies in their blood for years after recovery records also indicate that some people have been infected with the virus twice over meaning that these particular patients did not develop any immunity at all that is an assumption we don't know see in fact they were either means that say they one person is infected you got a positive test and then we got a negative test and then after something we get a positive test again that is what we call reinfection but we don't know this first infection correctly that it is it is positive second infection it is negative we don't know if it is a false positive or false negative etcetera therefore we this is the early phases of the of the topic of the of this particular infection therefore we don't know what exactly happening but at the same time that there will be some antibodies are produced and these antibodies a certain so many persons at least that these are useful antibodies that they will protect me the person from second infection but in some persons that it is not taking place now the bodies are two types the antibodies are called immunoglobulins immunoglobulins are many types of course it is prominently these are IG IG means Sigma know globulin immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G these are the two different types of antibodies when they are any infection is taking place here after the one let us say one week or something like that IgM antibodies are the first type that is coming coming up and then of course a few more days that the IgG antibodies are coming and therefore the presence of IgM antibodies indicate the recent exposure that he military within one week he has an interaction that is what IgM antibodies and why is the presence of IgG antibodies indicate the later stage infection that usually by IgG antibody has already come by that time the patient must have been cleared or the virus and he must have been already yeah all the disease manifestation will be are so over IgG antibodies against either a nucleo capsid or the spike protein or both these are these are detected all these are detected and anybody's against the receptor binding domain of this type protein or considered the main targets of virus neutralizing antibodies the neutralizing antibodies are the so called effective antibodies that means these antibodies will neutralize or remove the viruses from the circulation therefore that is the protective antibodies they are the antibodies useful to the body and these antibodies the IgG antibodies this particular antibodies we can detect so the this is the Corbett 1980 GG i JJ ina body test please remember that we are got a as this particular kids are now available to me marketed and within one week this will be available in the market here the simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to Corbett virus in human serum plasma or whole blood samples are available the advantage is that within 10 to 15 minutes where result will be available and that is why we say that it is the quick result or the rapid result a rapid test now we can say that chocolate the the the strips are there that brought in pepper like strips are de and the uppermost area you put the blood sample or plasma or serum and then and the reagent reagent will be available indicate and then that will be absorbed and after some time that there were all the necessary iand IgG antibodies etc will be already there in that particular sheet and that dotting pepper and therefore after 15 minutes you will get to such a result you can see in the upper part of the of the of the picture that in the left hand side upper upper part left hand side you can see the negative result that is all always will be there that there is a control negative control will be given and that control should be positive in all the tests and then on the right hand side out of that there is a awkward negative result is there and then there is one positive line that is there for so called IgG IgE is positive that is the immunoglobulin G is positive that means that there is in latent infection is already there for the last 20 20 days or something like that and then the next strip is that there is the IgM or Ikey antibodies that means that there is the comparatively new infection that within seven days of the infection that this particular antibody will be present and then the next they'll last society you can see that all the IgG as well as IgM are positive of course control is also positive there in the lower part of the thing that you can see that there are certain IgG I am i gay etcetera our lines are the the same time you see that in the trend side that a negative result is not the that means that this particular that particular test results could not be interpreted that is not a corrective texture that has to be eliminated from our test the know the I the antibody test negative results do not move out to the infection particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus because as I have told that in the initial phase in the first seven days there will be no antibodies in follow-up or testing with the molecular diagnostics should be considered to roll out the infection in those individuals therefore this could result or the rapid test if it is negative immediately that particular person has to go for the molecular diagnostic testing now regarding the antibody our antibody test is over the last one is the rapid antigen testing that is instructed the antibody we can test the viral protein antigens in the blood the similar similar to the cook test that is the rapid test can be done the target antigen will bind it to specific antibodies pixel to the paper strip and generate a usually detectable signal typically within 30 minutes this particular test is taught here to come in India therefore this is only of theoretical importance at the moment it is available in some certain areas in abroad it is also less than sitting there for we shall not going greater detail for this test this point I have told the specific test that is the molecule artists as well as the antibody tests these are specific for the virus that is the molecule tests will be specific to identify the day at or the army of the virus and the the antibody tests are specific to detect the antibodies that means that if the body has produced a certain antibodies now we are going a little with regard to the nonspecific test the essential role of clinical laboratories in this pandemic extends beyond the etiological diagnosis of covert biochemical monitoring of Khalid patients through in vitro diagnostic tests is critical for assessing the disease severity and progression as well as monitoring or therapeutic intervention and these are some of the ordinary laboratory tests that is useful for the for this particular for example laboratory tests complete blood count you can see that increased by table itself holder can be seen in bacterial or Soper infection against neutrophil count can be there in bacterial super infection and decreased in verse eight counter is seen in is decreased immunological response to the virus and that is very bad a prognostic prognostic indication the case the platelet count also seen in disseminated coagulopathy that is also a with manifestation similarly ldiots lactate dehydrogenase can be increased in pulmonary injury and especially when there is the virus isn't making the new Merliah like symptoms and the onion amino transferase aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin these are a patek markers and these markers are usually increased in usual liver injury these have nonspecific that means that it is not very specific for this particular virus at the same time that this when these parameters are increased that means that the liver injury is taking place similarly creatinine creatinine is increased in any kidney injury and the virus can in fact or virus markedly injury is also another manifestation of the disease and that can be detected by creatinine just cardiac troponin is increased when there is cardiac injury similarly d-dimer is increased when there is disseminated coagulate 3 and procurement IV is increased again in disability coagulopathy therefore these are worst manifestations that can take place that is that the patient is going for in a bad condition that means then procalcitonin is when there is bacterial super infection that is increased c-reactive protein am going greater detail later and therefore at the moment it is it is also it is seen in severe viral infection that is a common infection ferritin is increased wherever there is severe information but and cytokines such as I interleukin 6 etcetera that these are increased when there is cytokine storm syndrome therefore we shall go in greater detail of what is meant by the cytokine storm Zandro and also the importance of doing C C reactive protein test cytochromes tome nowadays it is the theory the theory is they presently accepted theory is that there is a dangerous or a reaction of the immune system or so called hyper inflammation in the late stages of the infection so and this hyper in the cytokine storm is characterized by increased in w can 6 interleukin 2 in the foreign gamma 2 necrosis factor-alpha ferritin and CRP out of this the first for one a year six il-2 interferon and TNF these are commonly not done in our society in our laboratories because these are costly one and those are not a very commonly available and so therefore forget about the DS at the moment these have at the moment mainly as research approaches whereas for Upton and CRP are available commonly available that is even our our Agra Paris market and all these things for it in in CRP out of this ferritin is not very useful for the for the diagnosis which I come integrate later whereas CRP is very important or very useful for the prognostication of the disease in coordinating test CRP levels were positively correlated with the lung lesions and could reflect the disease severity so many repairs have been published out on this aspect that CRP level go hand-in-hand with the disease severity and therefore for monitoring purposes the CRP is very useful so this is a graph you can see that the patient the days in the x-axis is the days in hospital and they're very accesses the severity of the disease the has mean days is increasing that the severity is engaging and you can see that there is a fork like appearance that in most of the cases lecture say 90 percent of the nineteen eighty percent of the cases that the patient is a recurring slowly but after some time that they will be completely recovered that whereas a two percent of the cases you can see that the severity of the diseases is engaged at a particular point that is the point that we want to identify what who are the person going for this severe disease who are the persons going for curing and how can we identify there comes the importance of CRP CRP level you can see that it goes parallel to the severity of the disease not only that it is parallel you can see that it is one or two days before and that the CRP level is increasing that means the CRP is a good indicator to identify that particular patient who are going for the bad disease and you can identify them previously and then they can you can give a very active treatment about them and that will that will be useful this is a very useful CRP is therefore a very useful laboratory test and that is again shown here in the last two bars of the CRP and il-6 the il-6 and CRP are going up in the clinical condition the key laboratory parameters for the outer impression with a conformal Corbitt and you can see that the normals as well as the abnormal conditions and that there will be statistically very significant but at the same time I guess I have told il-6 is very difficult or tests are not commonly available in the laboratory whereas a CRP is formally available the cytokine storm may be the contributing reason to the Cova deductr and that is why we are very much afraid of this cytokine storm and to detect that is important well how this this is coming what is it explanation for that when any sense senses that there is something bad happening the immediate response of the cell is to kill itself so for example the viruses he is entering into the into one particular cell that cell will immediately kill themselves this is suicide which commit suicide is because because of that there will be no further multiplication or divide us and therefore new cells will not be infected it is a protective mechanism so virus does not aspirated to other cells but at the same time the cytokine triggers the secretary have decided decide that is happening because of the cytokines but when you have is how many cells doing the same or more vital Kang's are will released into the circulation there will be more and more cells will be doing this commitment committing the suicide and a lot of tissue is therefore is died in call 19 that issue is mostly the lung tissue and therefore people are thinking about it at about 8 o'clock options especially of this cytokines a cytokine naturally cytokines will be depressed by steroids that are well-documented ready that the steroids will suppress all the imprimatur agent working conditions that what people thought why not we give steroids but the debris also is given the mandate that you should not should not give steroids in these conditions because that will reduce all the useful inflammatory response also even though there are some some clinical trials are going on steroids we forget about at the moment then the most recent the introduction is the amount of global that is the convalescence serum that is the patient has already got a Cohen and then they have been recovered from that naturally there will be IgG antibodies and these are protective antibodies and therefore that can be given in such a situation the people are trying on that similarly the cytokines can be broadly the manifestation is due to cytokine increase and therefore were you know to be block it is interleukin 1 can be blocked by an anchor a particular drug il 6 can be in pre inhibited by mana formula antibody or totally su mob and I am the achieve being tried it is sometimes as successfully in the treatment of of Khalid that is the retina where that is the pro that works against the protease or the of the virus then remembering that will inhibit in the wireless polymerase and the of course hydroxy Queeny only is also known to inhibit the virus entry to these new cells and therefore that is also being tried these are therapeutic options available at the moment and this is the summary of what I have given that the biomarkers that this a reactive protein which is also the last column you can see the associated with the severity and also the severity of the symptoms that the lung conditions similarly other things are also the complete blood count ingress d-dimer etcetera these are also comparatively associated with but out of this a c-reactive protein is the best next the other thing is you can see LDH idea these things I have been told but with regard to the ferritin even though ferritin predicts is sepsis mortality it is blunted with the severity in this in this Ovid infection and therefore it is not very useful and even though il-6 and etcetera are useful but these are costly and therefore it was summing up in that particular aspect the there is a great role of the CRP tester for the in they call winter testing the theory of protein is a ring shape and America protein circulating concentrations rise in response to any inflammation it is an acute phase protein of acute phase protein means that any information to a condition or any disease to condition there will be an increased engaged following interleukin 6 a secretion by macrophages and pieces and c-reactive protein is therefore nonspecific but at the same time it is useful for the prognostication purpose CRP by mr. hosmer : indeed I imagine a membranes of the cells and to extrinsic ligands expressed by many microorganisms and therefore and it activates therefore the complement pathway and therefore the CRP is at as a first line of defense against the viruses and and pro and microbes the C reactive protein is found in plasma and serum it is nonspecific marker or information so does not indicate the organ or organs affected its measurements can be used in to assess the cardiovascular risk status the CRP is usually measured by immunoassay and a hollow metric methods which I am coming in greater detail after some time more recently however the identification of the importance of small chronic elevation of CRP as cardiovascular risk marker is apparent empty individuals has led to the development of highly sensitive assays commonly referred to as H a CRP or high sensitive CRP see the HSE RP MA is the marker for the cardiac the cardiac marker whereas the CRP is a marker for inflammation general information how to detect these things which way I were called about an economic but before coming to nephelometry just one second each of these tests how to do that calorimetry is based on the beers law and the intensity of the color is proportional to the Colorado particles here the solution should be colored that should be free of particles there should be no turbidity that is the usual colorimetry about which all of us know but in the tab minima tree we make the solution purposefully turbid that and that turbidity that give to the turbidity that there will be scattering of light and unstated light is assessed and that is it will be proportional to the turbidity and therefore it will be proportional to the protein and the next step is that immuno turbidimetry that is where they let us say we take the serum when we want only a specific and and let us say we want to assess ceruloplasmin in such a case we and and these are our plasma antibody to that and then there will be a turbidity and that ability will be quantitative to that particular substance and therefore the that is what we call as immuno turbidimetry telemetry this is the principle that light the source that it passes through the light is possible the sample cell well there will be so many so so particular lights are scattered up and all other regions 180 degree that no non scattered light are taken that is called a transmitted light that is detected and that is turbidimetry on the other hand in the nephelometry that the scattered light so you can see that today the light is passed and that in light is passing that is refracted at various regions and ninety degrees in a region that we keep the detector and that is a what is the principle of nephelometry now the turbidimetry and the hallow material has been developed a few decades ago but never a material was not very popular because of the cost of the instrument instrument of course is about the 40 lakhs or something like that it cannot be affordable to ordinary laboratories whereas for manometry was not very popular because of lack of sensitivity although having very good specificity there were turbidimetry is used in proteins present in high concentrations while nephelometry is used to determine proteins present in many low concentrations CRP etc will come in that a low concentration therefore we ought to go for nephelometry next therefore we thought in the lava that a few years back that why you know to be combined in a kilometer and turbidimetry in the same instrument and therefore this is the result that you can see that that light is passing through that that the light is that they emit the transmitted light is detected as well as the refracted light is also detected and therefore because of that today the cost of the instrument is already used to very much such as I instead of 40 lakhs one lakh will one or two lakhs will be sufficient and that is the result you can see that this is the Mizpah III that is a calculated based automatic specific protein analyzer this offers the freedom to detect specific proteins including CRP and let's just see RP there are so many other parameters about 25 different parameters can be studied in this instrument and this is the Mizpah III serum protein analyzer see the advantage is that here both in a kilometer II and turbidimetry are both available and there is automatic selection that is the instrument will it's over identify the protein concentration and which is beste that if the concentration of the protein is lower then that will automatically select the turbidimetry estimation there are 25 parameters can be identified and because of that cost is reduced now this is with this thing that the in summary that I have made or the some details of the or the clinical manifestations of the disease and then we went a little more greater detail on the clinical laboratory testing of the specific test that is the molecular testing as well as the antibody testing and then I had gone for the nonspecific test that is available for the for the common diagnosis and out of that the CRP is very important for the prognostication and that these are the most important points that I had already described thank you very much open for some discussion thank you sir for the very extensive and enlightening expert news now we are open to questions we have received already certain questions so maybe posit you sir the first question so what were your personal protective equipment laboratory person must use positive patients not only positive cases any sample any blood sample that is it is a positive thing that we have to take all the precautions and these are the basic precautions that there is no particular instrument or something like that these are the that grows the last these are the basic courses that we ought to take the mask has to be filled that has to be removed and whenever is removed and not just to be disposed correctly that means that it has to be one more painting and then I think all the time hand washing these are the basic precautions that we have to pay otherwise there is no particular instrument answers the second question is can the lamp test be done on regular thermal cyclers or a new instrument is required you're an artist there is no particularly instrument required as such there is no thermal cycler thermal cycler is not at all necessary that you take test tube and in the particular reagent they the enzyme and other reagents and then after that you know the the a certain satyr that is that quantitation is that that quantitation is done for a particular parameter II instrument that instrument is shown in my in my slide that is that is the only a small instrument that is the only requirement all the PCR and all other things are removed and that is not at all required in the lamp technology that is the great advantage of the lamp technology right so the third question is diagnosis of Kovac 19 by taking blood sample has lesser accuracy than molecular testing still there is a heavy emphasis on it more while the advantage is that it is very easy to do it it needs only 10 or 15 minutes and that is why it is called a rapid test and that is the advantage is that the test will not be positive in the early stages where the virus is the replicating phase it is for it is posit it will be positive only after two weeks or something like that by the time the virus has already been eliminated by the by the body all right so thank you all thank you the participants for the overwhelming response to the webinar thank you for all the questions and the very active participation do share FP back on the webinar in the poll provided and then it great feed forward to all of us thank you all on Sydney and wish you all a fruitful and thus a clear head thank you thank you very much thank you very much [Music] you", "QR28aT45Y8I": "what's going on out there youtubers mr. weed Lee with the joie de lis show gonna do a just a quick cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "DrRSLuSShD4": "hey guys this is dab connection we're gonna be going over the difference between fake brass knuckles and real brass knuckles this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "kU-ZCOrrbck": "hey folks eric here whatever guys whatever me and

moving on from that as you guys know today's tuesday man and we're moving up on this ship man shipband's coming up march 27th um and like i said we're still not 100 sure other than the fact that we know that the end consumer is going to have an issue getting uh stuff shipped to them through usps fedex or the postal service however we do know that the one way to get around uh this shipman is to be a business have a business license and get wholesale accounts now for you folks out there that don't know you can easily apply for an ein with the irs which is totally free and get a business license or you know if you've got these convenience stores or these vape shops around your area and you'd like you know go ahead and combat this uh vape band from the get-go because really the vape band was designed to it was not designed to touch delphi really what it was designed to do was to touch these e-cigs and it was designed to put the onus on store owners to check um the ids of these guys coming in and getting these uh vape products but with way the way they wrote the law of and they stuck this in the pork of the stimulus bill the first year um but the way they wrote the law it actually extends out and touches everything bait and so as of march 27th um i've heard march 27th april first april 26th but on this channel we're going to talk about march 27th is the closest day uh you know uh you know prepare for the worst and hope for the best um but the the but the deal is that uh you guys can get those get those people to get wholesale accounts contact me at 334-830-8151.com let them get a wholesale account uh if they've never had deltae products in their store before they will not have created any bad habits by starting you know to get stuff that we've reviewed on this channel uh but if they have delta e products in their store um we'll send them out free samples man and they'll find out that what we're talking about on this channel is the real deal and they'll also find out that the prices are much better than what they're getting from those distributors off the truck you take that m a smoke shop or any of these uh just you know these local convenience stores around here they're all dealing with the same distributor and they all have basically the same stuff in their shop and that distributor doesn't know anything about delta a doesn't know anything about cbd he's just looking for a mass-produced product and that comes at a price of low quality and and you take uh you know her down there at the mma smoke shop she's got everything that she ever got off those watered-down delta a carts off that distributor truck for 35.99 and you got and she's got delta farms and blue moon in there for 34.99 personally it wouldn't matter to me if it was 45.99 because like i said before the purpose of this channel is to find the best lda products we can and um obviously you know my goal is to hope you know is the hope that you guys don't make the same mistakes i can if you see a you know you see me do a review on here it's a crappy product hopefully you guys will gravitate towards something that's a little bit better so moving on from that um uh talking about just letting you guys know i got a letter from a guy today or uh talking on youtube and he's over in the uk and we're talking back and forth and he's trying to get some stuff shipped over to him and he asked about this notice to law enforcement now there's a lot of companies out there that are putting this notice to law enforcement in their um in their packages when they send out usually it's a piece of paper as you can see blue moon is a little bit of cardboard box but basically this is just a letter to the law enforcement man letting them know uh that this is a hemp product that is you know it's totally legal totally illegal to buy over the counter to any at any business in the united states i think there's a couple states that actually do regulate it like three or four five i believe but either way uh the majority of the states this is this is legal all the way around and i think those states that that don't have it in theirs because they haven't figured out how to regulate it yet but the fact of the matter is the 2018 farm bill makes delta eight a hemp derived product totally 100 federally legal okay and that's what this card is and for you folks out there that are riding around and i'm guilty of this too i've been preaching this for quite a while you should have one of these in each one of your vehicles just throw in the glove box um you can throw in your centerpiece or whatever the case is uh the ones that are pieces of paper like i said you go to my my site which is whatever guy shop.com and you can go down into the blog and you can find notice law enforcement and download that okay and just keep a copy of that in your wallet man you know if you're walking around hanging out and then it's let's be honest man if i was to roll up on you and you were smoking you know you were vaping this or you were hitting on any of this stuff here i know for a fact you know i at least in my mind i think that you were smoking pot so let's be honest man in a cool way now and again this might not save you you know i understand this is a market employee but you know but why not try it you know what i mean it may save you some trouble at least at least add a little bit of uh uh you know genuine uh what you're telling is the truth when they pull you over and they get this we had a guy out in north carolina got pulled over for and i haven't still heard the end of this yet by the way but i got a message from a guy over north carolina he gets pulled over and because his delta farm stuff smelled like him and they thought it was uh and they thought it was weed they took it from him and they were going to test it for uh i guess stealth and i thc i'm assuming that he's okay because it obviously doesn't have any delta knight toc in it um but the fact of the matter is it smells like it it looks like it and you and it does the same effect some of the same effects as delta intc so why wouldn't it be that you know so if you're a cop you know i get it but if you're if you're the end consumer man it's just cool man to keep one of these in your car man unless you just be safe all the way around okay so as you guys know i'm in my location down here in pine hill alabama and we've been remodeling this place for a while uh running up on a deadline for myself you know basically and like i told you guys before i've been doing a lot of handyman work i've run hand-in-hand business and i had gotten away from that recently uh more or less you know doing stuff online but as i need the money to remodel this store here i've been doing um some handyman work and so the lady missed carol smith over in sweetwater alabama that i've been working for the last couple weeks and i've got some other work scattered around but she's she's my main focus of work i've been looking for some kitchen cabinets for a couple weeks and um i had went to meridian and bought some kitchen cabinets and they just weren't the right ones uh you know i ended up keeping them from my store but the fact that matters i ended up running over montgomery alabama um uh yesterday to pick up uh a drawer set and another kitchen cabinet for her and was at home depot over on east boulevard in montgomery alabama now when i left when i went in there i had a certain amount of money that i was going to spend and i ended up getting the drawer cabinet for like half off because it had this little damage on it that i could easily fix and so i was you know when i walked out i was kind of stoked i actually had extra money in my pocket the first thing i did was got on and started looking for vape shops so the first place i went to i ended up stopping at the only place i ended up stopping at because i got what i needed right there at haiti's apes uh this place is a heavy base in montgomery alabama so 505026 vaughan road uh the phone number is 334-398-8691 i went in there yesterday and i walked in and immediately somebody said hey welcome to heady vapes and so i got in there and i got to talking around and there was two guys in there one was a big round one was a skinnier guy i could tell that the bigger guy was really not happy with me asking questions that i was asking i was probably asking some questions uh that were probably more designed for the owner i just felt like you know with them being working in the store that they might have a little bit more knowledge on it i think the one question i asked him was if he had because they actually have their own brand of delta eight in that place and i was really interested in that because as i said before we're talking about this talking about this vape man and all that coming up you know i wanted to go in and see if they had some flowers and vapes and stuff like that and i actually ran across some good stuff um so i was asking you know what i asked you was i said if you had one product to put forward and you know you know for your brand what would it be and of course the guy was a little bit edgy about it now the other guy he was extremely knowledgeable um both of them were knowledgeable but one guy i think was a little bit uh you know and i recognize it because i get it myself had a little bit of anxiety about me asking me questions and stuff like that i get it man because i'm in the same boat that's why i do the uh delta eight in the first place and i apologize for that um but the other guy uh actually the first guy that i talked about that i thought maybe was getting a little anxious to be asking questions he introduced me uh to their flower they have they have their own flower at uh heady vapes in montgomery alabama uh this one is the kush and then one is the diesel they don't have it's not og kush it's just kush and diesel what i did was they had one gram uh cups like this for ten dollars a piece and i was able to pick each of those out because that's what he recommended and then the other guy apparently he might be the vapor out of the group he was the one that recommended this earthy now uh vape card lemon skunk vape card that i got so uh this is their brand and heady vapes now i don't know if they have any um wholesale accounts i don't know if they're doing any mail order i know they don't have a website um i i go into these stores and i wonder you know what they're thinking about you know it's almost like they're trying to hide a secret but the fact you know how you know secrets bro i mean here's the deal if you had the secret to cancer why would you hide it i mean my but i you know everybody thinks i got like corn on the market you know you could fill these up in your own backyard if that's what you wanted to do folks so you're not cornering a mark or anything like that um he's got this guy here man this earthy now is a really good product um there's a couple issues about it that i don't know i can tell obviously that he's not trying to ship these out he's probably not trying to get any further than what he's got going on that little corner market he's got going on um i i you know i think that's a a mistake you know by not branching out that's just my opinion um i'm gonna try to contact this guy later on and find out if he's got wholesale accounts any type of affiliate things going on like that because uh really what i found was between these two flowers um these are really good flowers that they've got infused with delta a okay and this car is a really good car before i even made it to the interstate i knew i had a good car uh as you can see it doesn't have any coas on it okay but um i'll read the back of it here and it says this is earthy now and it contains less than point three percent delta intc uh for ages 21 and over do not operate machine or vehicle while under the influence of this product consult a healthcare professional before using effects of hemp products may be delayed after two hours do not consume more than once every 12 hours this product may cause you to fail a drug test that's true all right and if you look on the side it's uh says lemon skunk and then the other side is from cannabinoid rich organic hemp but again we don't have any uh any milligrams of delta atc we don't have any coas on or anything like that um there's uh really nothing else on here it's just uh in a sense i mean other than the fact that this is a really [ __ ] good car this almost looks like a garbage like a like a gas station car like if i had walked into a gas station and saw this i wouldn't buy this at all um so the packaging is a little innocuous um i think that they could probably do something better with the packaging but that doesn't take away from what's inside this car man this is a really really good card the only down draw the cart that i saw um that i as you can see i've used i'll put my hand up behind it it's got a nice gold tint you can see there's quite a bit out of it because i've been vaping on it um you know all day yesterday or at least half a day yesterday and you know and some this morning um and i've baked on it pretty good uh it's a really viscous liquid as you can hold it over i'll hold it over where you guys can see um and obviously it's not moving hand behind it again this is a white ceramic tip with a metal core uh these look like viton seals um and this and let me tell you something the little skunk's got like a like a earthy lemon um almost like like a pine tree set next to a lemon tree like like if you could combine those smells that you know that that taste um that aftertaste that's what you get with this lemon scum but the effects man the effects are like way way up there um these are this is right up there with delta farms right after a blue moon um as a matter of fact um i would i would suggest to say that this is probably a little bit you know as far as like delta farms goes you know they got that totally they kind of lend towards more the the earthy flavors and then you got blue moon that kind of lends towards more the the discrete buyer this one sits slam in the middle because you got the earthy and the in the in the like fruity added together in in one cart and um this the effects are extremely good the only down draw that i saw this card is like after a while when i vape on it it did the tube in the middle did get a little bit restricted but it never got stopped up so and i'm going to continue to vape this and obviously when we do the weekly app on saturday maybe i'll have a little bit more information if i get down towards the end of the car that's had any issues or anything like that that's kind of what the weekly rap is designed for this is a really good car like i said you guys can contact teddy vapes over at 5026 vaughn road in montgomery alabama the phone number is 334-398-8691 you guys give him a call see what he's about and have that and tell that dude that you saw his uh reviews on the whatever channel on the whatever guy and that you want a code of whatever to get some percentage off when you walk in that store down there or possibly um get to the point like i said i've got this uh cush in this diesel and i will tell you this the kush is a really good because i've already had some of my pipe i'll do a review on it either tomorrow the next day these are really good delta eight infused uh hip flower i told you before um i this i probably rank this right up there with the moon rocks of uh hometown heroes so we'll talk about that later on i didn't open up the um the diesel yet but uh because i wanted to wait for the end but i couldn't wait to do the kush um so i'll talk to you guys about that probably tomorrow hey folks it's tuesday it's whatever guys signing off i told you guys to stick around the end i'll tell you how you can win yourself a brand new bottle of these nasa softgels from over at leafystock.com don't forget you can go to leafystock.com use code whatever to get these soft drills all day long for 20 off but borrowing that on cinco de mayo uh we're going to be giving away one of these nasa delta eight soft gels 15 milligram there's 50 in a bottle beginners ray on may 5th hey folks whatever got signed off because whatever me i hope everybody's having a great week see ya", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "Z3QMe5rXwUU": "[Music] what's up club lives are here and today we're talking about fake cartridges there are so many cartridge friends out now carvanha flavor brands jetty extracts heavy hitters king penn exotic cards so many brands and manufacturers now it's very difficult to figure out whether or not the product that you got is a clean genuine cannabis cartridge so we have 5 ways for you to determine whether or not what you're puffin on is the real deal if you feel in this content and you want to see more videos like this hit that subscribe button down below the like button shoot me a little feedback in the comment section we're trying to build community here so let me know packaging on legitimate genuine cannabis cartridges are very distinct and there are a couple things that you should look for a genuine cartridge we're gonna use this carvanha here for example a genuine cartridge always has the potency information listed on a sticker as opposed to printed on the box so if you see here the carvanha the carvanha potency is on that little white label I could peel it off with my finger if I wanted to that's not necessarily true for this flavors brands which claims that it's 91% on the box I can't take this off the reason why this is an issue is because each batch of oil needs to be tested individually depending on what state you're from every state regulates the cannabis oils differently and a third party has to test these not and ready oh gee so there is no way that they can know that this is 91% if your package comes with the potency pre-printed on it it's probably fake [Music] next is the bubble test if you don't know the bubble test is check out my video on streets disease versus legit disease will be bubble test of streets is e and aced is e that I pick up from the clinic and the bubbles move at different rates high quality cannabis oil or distillate moves a little slower than whatever junk they're putting in these cartridges so I'll pull the bubble test for you guys for my example cartridges for you to see but this is a great way for you to tell if what you're getting is booth and homemade or the real deal if your bubble races to the top is probably fake so we're doing a classic bubble test to compare our raw garden cartridge to this flavors brand and andragogy cartridge compare how fast these bubbles are moving you can see for yourself which one has the thicker oil [Music] the next way to tell if your cartridge is fake is brand recognition packaged counterfeiters have gotten very good and there are certain brands that they are known to counterfeit repeatedly brands like kingpin Stiggy plug and play oh man I've seen stuff called pissing excellence there are certain brands that don't have the cachet as a lot of their legal counterparts if you live in a if you live in a illegal State this may be harder for you to ascertain but for the most part if you here in California or in Nevada most brands have a well distinguished brand identity you should be able to Google their name find their website find out information about them if your cartridge is lacking in any of those areas it's probably fake the next way to tell if your cartridge is boof is through the cartridge design itself most manufacturers who exist in the legal market try very hard to distinguish themselves from the pack there are so many cartridge brands out here but this is the hervana C cell you see the custom bottom here a unique great tip here is the raw garden C cell note the plastic on the tip and the bottom and then at the bottom there's also an embossing like a chrome embossment saying raw garden extra touches extra touches now if we're gonna if we're gonna compare that to our suspected Street cart this andretti OG it didn't come with a tip on the top not nearly the level of customization here not nearly the level of customization and personal touch that you would find on other brands so if your brand is lacking in some of these little accouterments might be booth last way you know whether or not your cartridge is legitimate genuine or fake is through the taste test sometimes you just know if you get an uncharacteristic burning in your new clean your mucous membranes like your nose or your mouth or the back of your throat it might be a boof cart get brands are known to add things like MCT or botanical terpenes that may add a certain harshness to your hit however trust your instinct on this one if it's burning too much if it feels really uncomfortable if you're finding a little bit of irritation in your throat or your nose after vaping one of these it's probably fate well that's it you guys thank you for watching be sure to

because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you

things together in a second and I'll let you know", "T49_ZG_zc9I": "hello ladies and gentlemen i'm here coming with a thc delta eight vape pen review as you see i have it here i'll be doing an unpackaging tool just so you guys can get a real look at it and again this is thc delta 8 vape pen right here um if you guys are not aware yet uh delta 8 thc is actually legal federally you can get this at most smoke shops most gas stations a lot of corner stores um and you guys ask how is thc being legally sold so here's the deal there's delta 8 thc and there's delta 9 thc now delta 9 thc is the chassis that gets you extremely high and which is what is found in all of your marijuana and regular flour whatever you care to call it um so delta nine and thc a are the main psychoactive ingredients in marijuana and those ones are still illegal so you can't get any cartridges or vape pens that are just regular thc delta 9 or taca the main two active ingredients in marijuana that gets you high as [ __ ] basically excuse my french um so right here i have a delta eight one now the main difference is delta eight is missing a few atomic bonds is what they like to call it which makes it legal um it is a little bit less psychoactive but it still gives you a nice high and it's not cbd this is delta 8 thc this is not cbd but this does have some cbd in it and as you see here i have the treetop hem company it's a 700 milligram vape pen delta eight and one actually one of my favorite strains right there blue dream i love me some blue dream and that's cool part about these things it's just like your regular thc it comes in different strains um and again this became legal in 2018 it got approved by the agriculture improvement act here and the company i have here is a treetop hemp company that sells the delta eight thc pins and as you see i'll let you guys examine the packaging and i'll do an unpackaging so you guys can get a real look at it and again here's you must be over 21 to order this product um they as you see they have a suggestion date when they use it by so basically i got a year with this and they even have their website here this is shopyourthcbd.com so as you see this company sells cbd also um and also here too you see like i said um this product is in compliance with the section 10113 of the 2018 farm bill and it contains less than 0.3 percent d9 thc like i said d9 is the active the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana this is not d9 thc this is d8 thc and as you see where it says contains is hemp derived d8 thc it also has your cbd in it which is great cbn and contains like again less than 0.3 percent of d9 thc um i'm not sure exactly what cbn is i'm assuming it's similar to cbd but it also has that in it i'm sure it's just your regular hemp and the ingredients here as you see are contains canniboids delta eight and is flavored using terpenes and the great part of it is uh here it's domesticated i live in new york but as you see this was made in california so it's a domesticated product to see what's product i think these are pretty dope i already smoked um a couple of these before and it definitely gives you a high like i said it's less psychoactive the high might not last as long but it definitely does give you a high delta hthc right here we have um and i'll do it on packaging just give me one second so we have it here they put in a nice little concealed plastic packaging too again this is the blue dream strain as you see it says it right on it looks like it has it on the the pen itself too which is pretty cool tree top hem company shout out to the treetop him company let me go ahead and just open up this uh plastic packaging too all right here you go so it basically looks like your regular vape pen but um there's no tobacco or nicotine inside this ladies and gentlemen this is delta 8 thc like i said this is legal federally so you can get this at most smoke shops corner stores or even gas stations here in the united states [ __ ] i don't know if i can go ahead and just uh hopefully it's already working so i'm go ahead and hit it see what it does oh yeah that's a nice smoke oh that's like extremely nice smoke got me coughing so like i said guys next time you go to the smoke shop or gas station or corner store see if they have delta 8 thc there's a variety of different companies that are making them um the research i did on this company they're actually pretty good pretty good quality there's no nicotine in this no tobacco and all the [ __ ] this is actually a pretty good one right here 700 milligrams so i'm already i already feel it feels good too so again guys this is delta 8 thc vape pen um they're legal here in the united states this is not delta 9 thc that's the main the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana and um it is not thc a which is other main active ingredient in marijuana that gets you high this is delta 8 thc which is basically scientifically just different by a few atomic bonds if i want to get rick and morty on you guys and that's the main difference is just the main difference is really just how it's made what it's made out of and um the us technically has not uh made this illegal thc the thc that made it legal is like i said delta 9 thc and thc a and this is delta 8 thc and it still gets you high um and like i stated before it doesn't get you as high as your regular thc and when i say regular chc i just mean delta 9 thc and thc a but uh it definitely does get you high and um you can get a variety of strains i got this from a smoke shop a good smoke shop here in my neighborhood i live in new york state so um they had a variety of streams they had like i said as you see here i got blue dream they even had girl scout cookies they had wedding cake they had a sour diesel they had a bunch of them so you can even get your favorite strain out of this shout out to the treetop him company again that hit i took earlier definitely uh definitely did uh feel nice so again guys delta 8 thc is legal here um the main difference between the illegal thc is just a few atomic bonds so next time you go to your local gas station or corner store or smoke shop act if they got delta delta 8 thc and try it out yourself guys um these things are good i know they just don't have them in these vape looking things they also have them in cartridges cartridges excuse me um i actually have a cartridge myself and you look at the cartridge most of the the delta eight cartridges it's a clear liquid in size which is unusual um when you usually buy just the regular thc delta nine uh cartridges you're usually some type of color to them but every time you get a delta eight cartridges uh it's a clear liquid which i find uh i don't know i don't think about it to be honest with you i don't know if that if it being clear makes it a better quality or whatever you want to uh call it but this vape pin right here delta eight vape pen definitely hits nicely so hey guys that's my review shout out to the treetop hem company again and um as you see their website right there shop your thc cbd.com and now you must be over 21 to purchase this product ladies and gentlemen and that hit i took earlier i'm already feeling high so this thing definitely does its job it's more than cbd don't get don't get this confused with cbd guys this is not cbd this is thc it does have cbd in it but it's predominantly thc delta eight so yeah you guys have any questions or concerns leave your comments i've been smoking these for probably about over a month now so i can't complain too much and that's a wrap stay blessed ladies and gentlemen and stay high", "ljcGrFxwTRo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what's good youtube it's your boy cbd smoke doctor back with another review yes and let me tell you guys something man i really appreciate the support of getting from you guys out there i really do and if you're here for the first time welcome to the smokers room aka smokers lounge all right so as you can see from the shirt this review is coming in from dr ganja so dr gonz is kind of a big deal all right when you go on the website these guys got tons of things that you can choose from not only can you choose from dr ganja products but they also have a large variety of other products on their site and this is being one guys okay we got 95 delta eight thc oil cartridge all right and it has five percent terpenes added to it also this is the uh one milliliter cartridge and i already plugged this bad boy up just so y'all know i have tested this cartridge out and it is the bomb okay so let me just tell y'all guys a little bit about delta athc and um it's a little bit of magic inside here because delta eight is a little different than delta nine thc and um it's like the sister to delta nine it gives you mostly the same effects you won't get the paranoia uh what else you won't get that's basically it the paranoia um some people they do get anxiety from smoking regular thc you won't get that either okay this is a scaled down a little comma version of delta 9 thc okay but the effects are a lot similar so the difference between that and cbd now you know cbd we're only allowed to go to 0.3 on a thc scale now with this it's called delta 8 thc for a reason uh i don't want to get all scientific with you guys but i'm gonna tell you like this it it just seems like it's uh the highest closer to regular thc than i've ever experienced other than smoking regular thc if you mean if you know what i mean sorry about that so uh we'll get more in depth into it if you guys have any questions you really want to ask you can ask me in the comments all right because this is fairly new um i think this is a great area in our community whereas that uh we're able to exploit certain um scientific methods um that are used the genetics that are used but um this is awesome so delta 8 is the new boom this is not my first delta 8 cartridge matter of fact i am going to post another video um and i really enjoy them i love the euphoric feel that i get from them they're awesome so you head over to dr ganja get you one guys check it out telling you this one right here i'm really liking that all right and um this is called three shot and i love the company's product so far guys i really do and um like i said i've been smoking it uh sometimes other than smoking flour you want to get a little bit over the 0.3 threshold so that's when the delta eight comes in play because it can get me where i want to be guys okay and like i said i don't have um to deal with any paranoia anxiety sickness none of that stuff like that um it's just something that i really enjoying guys okay so this is the card here got it from dr ganja y'all guys go check them out and the taste is great like i said i only have five percent added terps into it so it's not major but it does have a great taste to it uh i love the natural taste also so that's just me when i do these vapes and um the oils and stuff like that i actually like that natural taste so they didn't have to add any terms any flavors or anything like that to make me enjoy it okay so um this one here has a more natural taste and i have this on the lowest setting okay because if i turn it up i'm gonna cough up a lung that's how potent this is and then also you have tons of medical benefits that you're gonna get with a delta eight card all right so i'm just letting you guys know i will have a discount on the bottom in the description so y'all guys can check out also the link to dr ganja's website and then if you guys come back in a day or two you should see a review on this okay this is the sour blue berry cush all right so i'm excited about that so i got both these products from dr ganja's website and they carry tons more so yeah guys go ahead and check them out man all right use my link use my link why not all right so smoke doctor is signing out right now guys but i'll be back shortly because we got to do that blueberry cook all right so y'all guys stay tuned smoke doctor signing out guys peace", "vPbO2jz-QSQ": "yeah alrighty we're back again with another heavy hitters this one's blue drain and it has got to be my least favorite a sativa from them maybe the least favorite overall I just don't think I'm a fan of the strain I mean there's nothing wrong with it the flavors on point I mean why is he gonna see the tape see is higher than some of the other ones so if it's your thing if you like Glee dream I mean I'm sure you like this yeah you just not fond of that strain it's more of a it's perfect for someone who's new to cannabis in my opinion cuz it's not it's not anything overwhelming in any sense it's just like a great for a beginner basically really not gonna get too high on this it's real mellow I don't know I get I get a little bit of a body high not just a little bit like so much so you call this a hybrid oh boy but they don't they call it a sativa so as you can see it's got the batch number and everything in the website you can look up the testing some steep hill back to all those older style cartridges I think I didn't like the new style cartridge better I wasn't sure at first but I definitely liked that anyone better it actually does a better job of waking up all the concentrate instead of leaving the blue dream this has a slight lemony flavor nice a slight because it's just not like punching in the face like some of the other ones or but it's still along with wine the kind of lemon flavor you get from Tila and not much else there's not much else there a little bit of fruity and like fruit flavor in the background or sweetness see ya nothing that like overall really stands out about this one don't get me wrong they did it right I mean it's really good still I'm just not a fan on the particular strain I'm sure someone will comment below talking about how it's their favorite because you know you just never know it's so personal that I mean for one person that can be the best their favorite and another person just not enjoy it so there you go that's a look at the Blue Dream from heavy hitters they effects a real wild so it's perfect for somebody who's new to they these are new to cannabis in general there you go thanks for watching", "IBB1abU3tBo": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with another west coast we tour review today's special guest jazzy reviewing the flav rx or i'm sorry it's no longer a flavor rx just the flav one milliliter premium refined cannabis oil ultra slim disposable and rechargeable i said it disposable and rechargeable all all-in-one oil pod and battery so this is lemon hey sativa convenient yeah this is this is super cool it is basically a disposable pen that is a full gram and it is rechargeable so we are here i'm going to open it up you let them know what the what is the say on the like the strain the the lemon haze okay this classic packaging pretty dope and then we look and dropped it here we're looking at the uh the actual device you can see the color of the oil a little bit is gold outside see if we can get out there and there you go nice little gold paint it's beaut it's a beautiful little vape almost looks like a usb drive nice and slick you know it reminds me of jules it honestly does it just reminds me of jewels so one hit review i'm gonna talk about it two hits four out of ten full review available on respectmyregion.com slave doing it big coming in hot working too hard rip it too hard yeah it doesn't say it doesn't oh it does have ingredients uh it says ultra refined cannabis oil so ultra refined is going to be distillate uh just as terpenes and then it says instructions press your lips against the mouthpiece and begin vaporizing by taking a three second drop oops so too big of a draw there that was probably fine misusing it is a common thing in vapes so here we go so you get a fat rip it's definitely potent you can taste the fruity terpenes tastes botanical does not taste like weed yeah definitely tastes like fruits and whatever else natural terps it's a little harsh it's a little harsh i'm sure it was hard for you because you took a long one yeah um i think someone who likes flavored things would probably like those products it rips i mean manufactured 722 it's going to be good until next year 7 22. i'm high you're high off that first i mean 86.84 total cannabinoids is a potent product in regards to you know thc in the best of the world it's not in the 90s by any means but when you combine some good terpenes um it can really get the job done so yeah it's so light it's very it's very light i i like i like how it feels i like how it hits um i like how it's branded i like the flavor there on both sides i think it's super dope it's a little slick for me i would like it to be a little bit more coarse and it does light up here in green when you do hit it on the second hit it's still pretty harsh for botanical terpenes and a disposable vape i think yeah it's definitely harsh look at the quality product would i recommend it not to anybody that wants live resumes or someone that wants the best of the best i think this is great for someone who's on the go very discreet maybe a cbd distillate vapor someone who is really looking for that super lemon haze like if super lemon haze is your favorite this tastes really good doesn't taste like real weed but it does taste really good so i'd say it's worth checking out score out of 10 though a flat eight for me i'm at a 7.5 maybe even a seven it just comes down to the packaging doesn't say what kind of terpenes it is doesn't give you the terpene profile and then the harshness like it just leads into this slippery slope of if you would have just told us that it was botanical terps and i would know in fact what it is and why it's happening oh nothing too just rechargeable disposable on their instagram um price point wise it's not even that expensive either so i mean if your you know disposables are your thing and you want to recharge it and um i don't know why you don't want to i mean i don't think you can change out the pod on this so i'm keeping my eight because it's just like it's convenient it's a full gram so maybe it's gonna die before you rip through the full ram i guess it's rechargeable but it can still die you just have to recharge it that's what i'm saying i feel like 7.5 final score for me i think it is what it is shout out to flav dope product uh definitely go check it out you guys this is another west coast week two review mail we're just keeping it real jazzasaurus j ping respect my region this is the west coast weed tour we are identifying the best products we

"[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out

cartridge make sure you're attached this little sticky thing on there little sticker in my shoes on Thursday now here it is we're into a bubble test and sits in the box numb before I take it out now the oil on this guy's is really really really thick so you know that's a really really good sign right there it's a good cartridge it does not move at all that is awesome so we're gonna head and uh Aaron's like take it out the box ice on this little plastic ding like I said this cartridge was $39 a full gram a rock garden cartridge is like 35 so you know I was amazed when they when when I found out these were little prices in the raw garden so you know they must be really good there you have the cartridge let's do another bob tears it says cold filtered in the middle of the cartridge inside so yeah guys this thing does not move now this is really really awesome my friend had a he had a a heavy hitters before but the tip it wasn't curved like this so I think that's a little that's something new they're doing to their cartridges so you guys can tell whether they're fake or real so if you guys have one with just a regular round tip it must be fake is these cartridges were barely made last month guys last month so these are really really fresh and new so that's something new I've never seen before as you guys can see the tip curves like that so you guys be on the lookout for that I show you guys have a California star sticker right there now we're glad to take it out take the little rubber things off [ __ ] no this is a team guys so I'm going to try hit it I'm seeing I get some flavors off in I'll let you guys some of it what it tastes like Wow first of all you get it tastes like pineapples some fruity my while we I've never had it but it shines like pineapples but tastes like pineapples as well and I but I had a guy on my comments section you know telling me that stay away from my bug mark cartridges and it's true you know there's a lot of news that I've been coming on you know there's a like right here in California and I seen that like whatever they did like some tests on like random random cartridges and they round they found some shitty stuff in them so you know you guys got to be careful who you guys buying them and where you guys getting them from so yes try and stay away from those cartridges from the streets they're really bad for you guys why don't you guys to be healthy and oh yeah like I said in my other videos you know yes that's all you guys could get your hands on you know [ __ ] you I mean you guys don't have dispensaries or [ __ ] like that well I understand no but yeah guys I'm go ahead and hit this for you guys like I said thank you for my 175 subscribers it's awesome you know I was I was gonna tea I was gonna get that much like in two months that's crazy I still can't believe it but am I gonna hit this for you guys Cheers smoke along wow this thing is fire they taste really really clean as like a how can I say it doesn't taste like a rock garden it's way different but the taste on this is really really clean you can actually taste some real terpenes in it it tastes straight-up like a fruity fruity pineapple it is so delicious I'm glad hit this again now let me know oh [ __ ] this thing rips and if I can tastes amazing if it cost more than a rock garden it tastes amazing you guys know if it cost more than a rock garden this definitely has to be good now I'm still wondering what does it mean by it cold filtered email let me know you guys don't forget let me know in the comment section below what does that mean but be on the lookout for these round kind of curvy tips also if you guys ever buy one now the hi I already feel like a little head change in this it's fire guys I can still taste the damn cartridge in my mouth that's how tasty it is it's really really good no yeah eighty five point 93 so that's a really really strong cartridge it's the Teva strong cartridge right there you know let me know what other cartridges you guys would like to see I'll get my hands on anything let me know if you guys would be interested like inst is e I was gonna get a steezy battery today but I was like I'll probably wait in another week or so doing unboxing for you guys bad ru everything but ya know big big thank you to my frequent kilometers as well as ones that I always shown live on my comments section you guys are awesome and yeah guys I'm go ahead and hit it again before I take off I'm hearing about this Himalaya battery I [ __ ] found it it was I was a fellas store was i but I found it and I was like oh [ __ ] and then I screwed it out to my battery and it [ __ ] works amazing but yeah guys the cartridges fire like I said I paid $39 for it it is cheap right here in California if you guys ever go to dispensaries Spencer E some dispensaries they cost a little bit more but it just depends on where you go or what part of California from but but yeah guys it's a heavy hitter I know it's fire I'm already high as [ __ ] like I'm confused I don't know to [ __ ] say anymore but but yeah guys I'm gonna cut this video short you know thank you guys for watching stay tuned for more videos and yeah guys peace", "4OlmQRxY3QU": "hey what's up everyone it's your boy mr. blinky back again with another video today I'm gonna be looking at this fake heavy hitters cart and showing you guys the signs to look for when you're buying your own heavy hitters carts to see which ones are fake and which ones are real so let's go ahead and get into the video all right so there are five big signs to look for when it comes to identifying a fake over a real heavy hitters cart so I'm just gonna quickly go into each of those first up we have cold filtered at the top real heavy hitters carts that are sold as one gram cartridges do not say cold filtered at the top they just simply don't have that they just say all of this stuff so that's already a big red flag second red flag would be that California label on the inside of the box that I'm trying to show you guys that should not be there that should be blank and it should just have the hh4 heavy hitters on this silver foil type thing or the silver foil type paper on the inside of the packaging that California label that you see right there should actually be right here unauthentic heavy hitters packaging the third sign is right down here where you see the 2019 fluids manufacturing ink and all of that other [ __ ] that should not be there which should be there is this push to release embroidered into the Box where you have to tear it to open it you should not be able to open real cart boxes this easily because obviously that can make it easy for anyone to just put whatever they want into these boxes so the fourth sign would be right here where it says instructions that should actually say suggested use and then finally you have right here where it says Bubba cush that is not a strain that heavy-hitters offers in there one gram cartridges I'm gonna link the heavy-hitters website in the description but you can actually go there and see a list of every strain they offer so if your plug is trying to sell you one that's not on that list on their website then you know he's bullshitting you those are a few very quick signs that you can look at to see if you're gay faker a real heavy hitter skirt now I'm gonna go ahead and plug it into my battery take a few puffs on it to see how it tastes and see how it hits and I'll go ahead and come back tomorrow until you guys how the high is how it makes me feel and if these are even worth buying so yeah let's go ahead and get into that all right so the 710 carts that these heavy hitters are using are not DAB cap compatible unfortunately it's the same kind of tip that you can see in exotic carts it's sort of like a funnel but it's too small to actually clip on or not clip on but like attached itself to the dab cap so unfortunately I can't show you guys a rip through a rake but if these carts are actually decent I'll figure out how to do that for tomorrow so for now let's just go ahead and take a few puffs see how these cards taste and how they rip and I'll let you know my thoughts so cheers guys [Music] so off that rip I'm getting a bit of earthy taste it tastes kind of like dirt if I'm being honest it's not very pleasant but the smoke is really smooth and it doesn't really hurt my lungs while I'm hitting it so that's a good sign I'm gonna go ahead and take another rip and we'll see if I'm starting to feel the buzz off - so Cheers [Music] yeah I'm getting good cloud production on it I don't feel a buzz or anything but these are so it doesn't feel like a chore daf-2 puffs on this cart I'd actually definitely hit this thing all day so I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'll come back tomorrow and share my thoughts and we'll see if these cars are worth buying so I'll see you guys tomorrow all right guys so I'm going through so much [ __ ] to get this video done right now this is my third time recording this part of the video because the first time I recorded it I didn't press report the second time I recorded it I had a Miranda sings hairline so we cut that [ __ ] out I'm gonna leave the other half of this part in simply because like I don't want to re-record that I do not want to get that high again you'll see I was super fried during this F um and I look terrible but anyway so things I went over in the part where I had the bad hair line so I've used this hurt for two days now and I used it for two days because I didn't think one day was enough to get like a good read on the highs of the potency and all the other good stuff I like to review oh and what got cut out was when I was talking about the potency it's really good four to five hits gets you a nice buzz six to seven hits gets you high and then if you get to nine hits then you might be slow to order in space like this current really does hit heavy even if it's not like a legit heavy hitters cart um and yeah now I'll go back to myself in the past um to finish off the video so see you guys oh yeah and the camera angles suck right now because my tripod literally just broke while I was trying to finish this video so you know we're just having fun it's a it's a great time book ago or I'm right but uh yeah so I'm ordering new tripod so I can fix my ankles again we might have to go back to the old recording area yeah so channel updates yay next up we have how long these cards last I have been using this card for two days now and it's about 1/4 of the way done so that means I would probably last around eight days if you're lucky um I've also been sort of with this cart not gonna lie but it does get me high for a long time so like being sparing is also easy with it my next point is the flavour and wax quality I know in my initial review of it I said it just tasted like straight dirt but after hitting it a few more times I can start of I can sort of start to taste more earthy tones like when you taste coffee um it doesn't taste exactly like coffee but it does taste sweet and earthy like a coffee beverage would um I would highly recommend getting this cart honestly like the wax quality is decent it's very slow-moving which was it like a good sign for me and unlike what the TKO cart even though it's slow-moving this one actually does hit really [ __ ] hard um if you guys have these around you and they look around the same like quality as these ones I would highly recommend picking them up I would set these up like right there with tanks and dab woods um easily an 8 out of 10 um I already filmed this review and I'm really high right now so it's kind of hard to like keep a steady train of thought but I think all I have it done for the second half is take hits on camera so let's go ahead and take two rips out of the battery then we'll go and take two rips through violet and then we'll end the video so thank you guys so much for watching if you made it this far please leave in the comments what your favorite cart brand is right now because I'm trying to find new brands to try I already have dragon's breath on my list um and I really want to try ROH soon um but yeah and please in the comments stop telling me to try likes dizzy I can't try Suzy's even though I really want to so every time you all tell me to try as dizzy I just died a little bit more inside um where I live we don't have like studies all right so I cannot try though thanks for the suggestions though I really appreciate it and if I do ever find its dizzy the first thing I will do is record myself dry again so um yeah let's go ahead and get into these rips guys Cheers yeah it just tastes really good and the hits are actually starting to be pretty smooth off of it too um when I first recorded it I coughed like a [ __ ] after all of my hits but now that I'm already high all these sets just feel smooth and it tastes really good so let's go ahead and take another hit Cheers my throat bout dry as [ __ ] so let me go ahead and drink some water and then I'll take another hit I hope y'all can see how high I am right now cuz I believe is [ __ ] fried right anyway so Cheers [Music] I tried I tried to do a ghost I don't know if it showed but yeah but we tried all right anyway let's go ahead and take a few ribs through violet and then I'll end the video so the hard part is trying to figure out how to smooth these through a dab cap so I'm gonna get behind the camera and just show you real close-up like the easiest way to do it so that in case you guys have a dab cap in these kind of tips you can smoke them through rigs too so to get this with a dab cap this is so hard to hold with one hand you have to like put the dad cap upside down and then you just have to like hold the car on top of it see if it'll focus and then you just have to hold the car on top of it like that and that way it funnels into the piece anyway I'll go ahead and show you guys I hit yeah so just for the record real quick this will be my third hit through violet off off this cart since I've started my smoke sesh um and I've probably taken five hits of the cart like on just trying to do this review and I'm already like this fried so that should just speak for the like potency of this cart alright the pink incident I didn't realize all right I know this next hit is gonna send me so I'm gonna go ahead and say peace right now thank you so much for watching and I hope you guys stick around my next video is gonna be sort of a channel update I think and I'm gonna be talking about this giveaway that I want to do but yeah leave them in the comments some ideas of it keep it kind of like under a hundred bucks or around 100 bucks cuz I'm just having to pay for this out of pocket so thanks again for watching all of my content thank you guys for subscribing and commenting and like my videos all of it means a lot to me and I do my best to respond to as many comments as I can but if I ever miss your comment just like comment again or something or like if you want you can hit me up on Instagram and Twitter like y'all are chill and I like having a community

[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "ZQImEJ1zG9w": "[Music] yo yo what's up guys it's your boy savage back yet again with another review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the

dab you first okay sounds good and then you take the cold one yeah yeah Wow state [ __ ] I'm dead", "qkCIBbk6lBA": "hello welcome to serenity vape today i want to talk about triangle trading companies delta 8 thc cartridges these are these are really cool i've got one here in a kang vape th-710 it's a nice little drop system vaporizer works really well this is something that's refined from the cannabis sativa plant and put back together but unlike some of the delta 8 thc cartridges that have come before it this is purely extracted from it is entirely from a cannabis plant that has less than 0.3 thc what that means is that not only is the product legal there's zero risk of it containing anything other than delta a thc and the 50 milligrams of terpenes that they put in to give it the same kind of effect that you would get in flour or you know a cartridge that you would get out of a dispensary the quality is good this is really cool it's it still gives you a kind of high it it's pretty strong actually it's less so than your typical your old school marijuana or the kind of carts that you'll get out of the dispensary it's safe it's just delta 8 thc 950 milligrams of it and then they add 50 milligrams of terpenes which make it much like the strain that's on the label for example this is pineapple kush and having had regular pineapple kush and having had this i'd say the experience is spot on i've tried some other strains like maui wowie which has an amazing effect and flavor i was was very awake for it it's one of the things that happens for me i right now i really like their hybrid sour space candy takes away the pain takes away any stomach discomfort i have and i'm chill the the anti-medic or rather anti-nausea stops you from vomiting uh effects of this delta eight thc it it's so effective you know it's not like i went out and i had a bunch of junk food and overheat and tried it you know but what they found about two years ago when they studied this on juvenile chemo patients was that they administered it two hours before chemo and then every six hours after the chemo it completely stopped vomiting for these kids they were able to keep their food down they were able to work through the day you know they were able to go through the rest of their day for me somebody who has celiac and ibs this is this is great you know i could be you know perfectly following my diet and i hear this about people with crohn's too where you know they're doing everything right but sometimes you just need something extra it works for that it works for anxiety it works for pain some of the strains are mellower but for the price point you know you're paying 45 for a one gram cartridge so something that i would say is just a step below medical grade it's it's pretty good especially if you can't afford a medical marijuana license um sometimes there's some serious hoops that you have to jump through to get one and not everybody who needs the assistance that medical marijuana can provide is gonna be able to get a license or a marijuana card whatever you want to call it green card i'm somebody who is very strongly affected by my marijuana and you know 25 to 35 thc and a strain of flour means i can enjoy very little before i might start feeling paranoid or too sluggish to do anything you know like getting couch locked every so often is nice but i not a huge fan i don't feel couch locked with these um i don't feel even like the beginning phases of paranoia you know that that kind of automat like mechanical paranoia that sometimes happens when you smoke like it just there's nothing you know it's not that you don't it's not that you have something in the background that's bothering you it's just boom that doesn't happen with these cartridges i've tried three of their strains so far i started out with the pineapple kush which comes in this nice little package um you can see their qr code on the back the pineapple cush i really liked for its more mellow uplifting effects uh i wasn't like boom boom boom distracted and all over the place the maui was delicious very strong you know i felt like locked in place not because my body was was melting you know as had as has happened on some some indicos i've had but just because my head was buzzing so much and what i've been vaping over the last few days is their sour space candy this so far might actually be my favorite i'm the twist in between on that one um i do get the beneficial effects of the indica i my you know any physical pain i have is turned way down uh and i'm somebody who has fibromyalgia so even on a good day i might be in pain so having something like this uh waiting at home when i'm not at work or even if i am is good for me because i can still focus mostly but my pain is negligible for somebody who has arthritis or fibromyalgia or any other widespread pain disorder i think this is really good as a product the other strain i'm thinking of trying is actually their northern lights remember northern lights putting me out and one customer has told me that they had just one hit off of the northern lights and they were out deep asleep about half an hour they slept through the entire night worked really well for them for me there's not enough of a difference to rush out and go to a dispensary this this cuts the mustard for me now it doesn't cut it for everybody and you'll still find stronger medicine at a dispensary but if that's not an option for you these are really good and even if you can go to a dispensary you might actually be saving money and getting similar enough of an effect or exactly what you need out of these cards thanks to triangle trading company for reaching out to us we really hope that you guys keep doing this i really want to try some of your other strains like headband for example so this is jonathan from serenityvape thanks for listening if you like what you saw or you want to see more subscribe to our channel and you

video in the minute um that runs video was pretty filmed I'm like a month ago this is like November so that was just something I had that I was able to upload you know does it mean time but I'd be kind of slowing down my videos lately cuz uh not just some [ __ ] has been going on but today I got the [ __ ] kingpin review what did you pack it so let's get into this [ __ ] guys alright so to start off this is a picture of the old packaging and this is how the new packaging is going to look like so doesn't it come in the a tin box like this right you're gonna have this in the front and say kingpin the strain named hybrid in the cursor to go and on the back is where you're gonna have all your information so they put it all in the back instead of like on the sides and stuff the sides are all planned and here actually you're gonna have right when you first open you're gonna have an office authentication sticker there's gonna be like some green sticker with like a key around it type thing and it's gonna have a serial number and I need to look it up or something and I'm pretty sure you can find the authenticity like I'll keep this page or something I don't know but to open it you just simply take that sticker off and lift up and this we can be presented with you're gonna be presented with a black kingpin type of thing a to you just moved from there and this is like plastic to just all tuned and you just pop it open like a Pierrot boom comes out and these are gonna be kingpins new cartridges they're gonna be the regular Cecil cartridges they're not using the metal cards anymore and that kingpin a branding earth there's of stickers not even though printed on the undercard anything it just goes along with the California sticker and this is what the new car is in the B because of the black tube the distillate on this cart is does not taste like gum the disability from when they had the metal cartridges like those I don't know there's something different about it and it looks way different now I've never got to meet him I never got to make a video on keeping but they used to be like pretty clear you know what used to be like this has it it's clear you know it's [ __ ] clear but no how it has like a really gold tint to it it was like clear that before I had like a clear tint to it hello and it tastes I mean it tastes cool now this is my first time getting gelato and this flavor is really strong idyllic flavor got stronger you know there's a lot not in a bad way but you know if the flavor got stronger you could taste the flavor a lot more that's a good taste but it just doesn't hug it doesn't hit as hard I don't know and I feel like with these cartridges the last ones by way quicker just because you have like what four different openings for the wax to go to the clothes so just goes about way quicker I mean you might get a bigger hit but it just makes it go by way quicker and I rather I just have the old school Kaitlyn styled Christchurch my gosh it was perfect to be honest like it was it was you know one of a kind like you know if you seen that car those could be detecting you know because nobody had a long type of car like Dan tips for like a flat and short whoo I like those cars on you [ __ ] with these did everybody else is this like this is like this coming for the review you guys haven't seen it go check it out book I would almost compare this to a skunk for the now like before kingpin was honestly like number one like I always say regarding there's number one our city is like number two or three like right next to LA cuz you know so this kind of sucks that they had to change to this cartridge in I mean from what I could tell it just it was different tastes different looks different but other than that just kidding take some history mister you see the clouds it still throws amazing clouds taste is on point I mean there is nothing wrong I've said it in videos before and that reviewed cartridges I said this was like a 10 out of 10 so this thing was perfect got you high every single hit but now I feel like I need like two hits just to get it like a cool buzz no but we're gonna screw it onto the battery right here that the began battery the smoke shop honeydew but uh take a little blink no I won't say I was about to take a big see from that swallow to hit a cool colleague No - days in Chicago first time getting to shake the cards auto stasis in from the cartridge y'all [ __ ] tasty same for some reason yeah guys this is a new packaging for keeping like a little thumbnail weather yeah handy packaging man not much to it cool packaging is the point takes away your point is a [ __ ] new style of a cart so kind of just even in our heart just stick to the cartridge and buried this to it then to get a [ __ ] a better packaging they probably did this just because um just to catch people's eye you know get some new customers or something but man you didn't have to [ __ ] change [ __ ] car I wasn't expecting for the card to be Delta like cars gonna be the same I told him just the package man change I was surprised but as I'm here for the video guys who VI spied you guys to go baby here around two and nine make sure good I mean yeah you know what I'm a [ __ ] stick to my my roots PCF and phenols man and flavors even though I haven't been the flavors go to those man never had a bad experience one time bro I have [ __ ] bought a $25 grandma sauce and I got home and I realized that lady charged me fifty five dollars for the [ __ ] grandma sauce I like what the foot and because I bought other stuff we're doing you know siding notice they came up like 150 okay then guesses make sense and I get home check the receipt on my wall with the foot saw a column I'm like bread I'm not from Modesto I'm a little bit a little bit of ways you know I was like I could take it back but I was like back you know and don't worry they're like you come in time we've assigned credits to your account blah blah my damn bow they did this Auto phone you know like ultra phone we call them daily or have any waiting like keep me waiting they called me back you know like they're like we'll call you back we're gonna fix anything for you bro I spent at least an hour and a half least the least an hour at the [ __ ] the spiritually trying to I bought accidental God extra cart I miss you by three cards I'm Adam it's like to bloom cards and a kingpin and I got three boon cards in one keeping and I went back to try to return it and they're like oh we lost have returns and I'm right back then okay I don't know they're awful it's just made of the policy of [ __ ] returning cartridges so [ __ ] stupid bro like you're not losing money the [ __ ] company keeping itself is losing money you're not the one that you get a replacement for free at least have seen those kids they said like oh that's cool because I literally take our shoes half ways fools like when because I like stop working like that [ __ ] rod or anyone that's halfway through not hitting [ __ ] this I have to go return this year like halfway school maybe a court before and they took it man that's proper all that that's what keeps customers that's why when you walk in there usually for most of the time you mean ones fool goes by like that bunch of quick so shouts out a pcfg mister flavors and blue fire that's a new location out there and we're safe so you guys aren't there so make sure to go check them out is I haven't even told the guys a [ __ ] name of the [ __ ] I'm not even a [ __ ] it mention the [ __ ] name of the [ __ ] dispatcher I went to for this [ __ ] but yeah guys I just went around bullying pocket cut that up a lot but some of you for the video and take a bleeder to end it and you guys [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music]", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it

also sister G Pharma TV here coming at you with another tutorial and today I'm going to give you a quick rundown on how to use the new and improved liquid gold vape pen comes packaged with just the mod and actually a key charger and you go ahead and charge your pen it will turn on red and when it's fully charged it will turn on green indicating that it's fully charged this 510 threading pen is compatible with both drug run and pure tanks 510 thread and cartridges and the first thing you want to go ahead and do after you put your cartridge on is simply turn on the panel by pressing the flash button five times five then you want to go ahead and activate the pre heating element by pressing the flash button two times we'll go ahead and see a mixture of all the colors and if you want to go ahead and stop it from the pre heating element I soon as you see the smoke you press that button once and you stop the creating mistake I do not recommend you to vape this cartridge while it is in increasing state after you're done preheating your oil it's ready to vape the first setting that it will go ahead and start off is when it's green setting which is the lowest voltage of the three three point six volt if you press the splash button three times it will then move the voltage from green to blue from the lowest setting to the highest setting at 4.00 voltage the draw difference between the green setting in the blue lady makes night and day I definitely got a bigger risk and it was a definitely a little bit more calm after the blue setting by simply pressing the splash button three it will drop down to the middle to the neutral blinking red you now know you're vaping it at its middle setting at 3.8 voltage now whatever setting you prefer adjust it try out the waters see what works best up for you when you're done and you have the voltage that fits your need just simply hold down the splash but in this pen and battery is designed to go ahead and turn off after eight seconds of date and automatically so we do this for your safety we understand you have lungs of Steel you get wine eight seconds of 18 per hit you can simply go ahead and let go before the eighth second and continue with your desire to have a bigger hit that's the small tip the new liquid gold vape in coming in assorted colors 510 threading and packaged with its own USB charger a new warmup feature when you click the splash button twice and you can go ahead and activate three voltage settings all color-coordinated by clicking a splash button three times and of course turn on your pin and turn it off with a simple 5 splash click go ahead and make sure you check out the closest retailer near you on G farmer navcom and if you're already making make the switch to a liquid gold vape in and save yourself some time I know what voltage you're vaping your oil and being controlled with the liquid gold vape in don't forget to go ahead and like this video and subscribe to our YouTube channel I'm Chris with Jeep farmer TV saying stay up [Music]", "YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all

video peace you", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn more about their

looks good i got blue dream bro i'm not even [ __ ] playing [ __ ] if you want to put down your [ __ ] delta 9 thc cards blood for a while to get a tolerance break just some good stuff anyway ingredients contains cannabinoids delta eight and is flavored with terpenes obviously all right so it contains hemp derived delta eight thc cbd cbn and less than point three percent of delta ninety hc unless i'm reading that wrong it's more than point three percent in other words delta a um i don't know is it a plant probably yeah what i do know about delta eight is it's mixed with it has cbd and some delta nine i'm not too [ __ ] i'm not listening no in common i'm not too keen on this but has them those two mixed into one or in the same plant as the delta a ah i don't know what i'm even [ __ ] trying to say but anyway also wait i'm gonna put the link down these guys [ __ ] sound [ __ ] starburst with it i'm not even making this [ __ ] up they sent out [ __ ] starbursts and it [ __ ] like tied it in here so [ __ ] hard to unwrap it like damn they were cracking the [ __ ] down oh and it came with all right let's just hit it no the fans on it couldn't do a trick damn i was wondering what my characters just [ __ ] all right yeah guys this is something there's some good [ __ ] y'all need to try", "EfGnRIjVzt8": "so I've been feeling these these are really nice not sure if I can zoom in on these but if you can see I see right there see how nice I like this one a lot it's connecting one is one of the real ones and if you can see over here see if I can zoom in you can see how clear these are right even this one that's like got overheated that one still looks still really crystal clear right you can even see it in this one very clear and then I get this this one's not clear at all and when you talk from these that aren't clear you can kind of see the difference right here like there's just a sheer difference and even in the same let's connect the one this one it's hard to duplicate so this was real but this one super-shady I mean I shady but ghostly and and this one kind of - but I open it but you should watch out for this man because this stuff you can talk for days and it actually won't get you anywhere this one does the job but these that I've opened up they'll have this kind of ghosting to the I've heard are the fake ones and they're really cheap they sell for probably like maybe twenty-five thirty-five at cost and then you know make sell these for like 65 80 whatever but this one's one of the fake ones actually they've been taking these and that's probably why brass knuckles if you find them for like anything less than 47 then it's probably fake it's gonna be like this and ghostly you'll put it next to all these and you're gonna see like whoa why is this so uh why is this so boasting compared to even this best friend over here when we put it it's just you can see that you like you can see the bars but this one there's no line no sharp line saying these right here don't talk too well you should avoid buying these if you see it make sure they're clear", "A8ust-NDETQ": "as a teacher you will appreciate how exciting and engaging the topic of fireworks it but how can you bring fireworks into the classrooms safely well here on teachers TV we'll show you how we've come to chew Valley School in Bristol and i'm going to be showing some experiments to a willing guinea pig science teacher trevor thorley he's going to have to watch carefully because i'm going to pick some of the experiments for him to perform for the very first time so let's get straight to the experiments okay Travis so our first demonstration here is to do with oxygen and I'm sure you're familiar with the burning spill in oh and the glowing so yeah yeah let's just have a look at that okay and we won't fall okay so it really aids that combustion doesn't it what now if you put a burning one into oxygen let's have a look at that burn into the option C oxygen really intense burn there and by controlling how quickly materials burn we can have really high energy releasing and really sort of gentle energy release as well but we also use it with metals by changing the amount of oxidizing agent available to a metal they can get the metal to to oxide really quickly or very slowly anyone what we want to achieve an iron is one of the metals that it is indeed obviously we don't let say is why wall but you might recognize some of the effects when you see it going Aaron it's sparking just you see a very bright really bright it's a sparking effect coming off and that's that's why we use eyes for you get a really orangie effect BTW create sparks a nice color so lovely color isn't it got we've got a mixture of a 50-50 mix of water and ethanol in here and we've put added our metal salt this is a little bit like a flame thrower if you like hey I'll mixture across the flame and we should get a nice puff of there the color fight I'm gonna do this one just like this and you just Oh beautifully nice I point why isn't it yeah rather than just very visible you're very visible and also it's gonna keep our bumps in my section 8 we could try another color pal well we got here we got some lithium nitrate and I'll have and the lithium gonna give us a be read a little bit read by nice color with trepidation yeah the purple color so you know a good or if Old Faithful isn't it but you might want to do that with a light stand or something but it's just no way of showing it isn't it good demonstration just imagine this is that yeah excellent be of those colors of course is absolutely crucial to play lex I'm filings very fine ones we're just going to hold the spatter over the top just very gently just uh no the other filings just church her to roll off so really just got a little bit like that literally just gonna hop in fact you can already see it starting to take effect okay a spark in really well let's go that looks lovely did we're not clogging the Bunsen up that's really important right now that's just what what's happening when the spot has been you got that core that's good yeah well I look battle degrees if we put a bit of paper nearby and catch some of those folks everything we've got sparks hitting the paper but we're collecting some of the natural dusty particles there so you can see they're actually those hot partners were hitting it however if I just touch loop the cool air the papers caught fire so we'll put into our entire water there thanks to do with the volume and surface area ratio of those particles that are coming off what mustn't you do once the sparkles gone out you mustn't touch it attorney no that's right we know when you're training to water right cuz it's very rod itself is daughter itself has got a bigger volume competitive surface area so you got your metal rod you got your sparks so it can be after the sparklers ended sparkling weather where the damage can I go that's where you get a lot of injuries so we have our solution of potassium nitrate and that's a saturated solution and literally its case of taking some strips of paper like this dunking it into our making sure it's really soaked dawn yeah really so do you really want that soaked really embedded in the paper and this is the time consuming bit next is to dry attack so i usually use a hair dryer right to demonstrate the fuse we use these ones at with you paired earlier okay so we'll just move that wet one out of the way now all I want you to do is take a lit splint okay and just apply it to the end and just apply that to right to the end of your fuse and sees it takes me away that's it take away now what you can see this is burning across very slowly and that's exactly what happens in a fuse it's a fuse principle but it's not a constant burn we've got some arrows at a bit quicker than others so actually in the industry we wouldn't use that but it's an old type effusive a simple type of fuse to share that principle in the classroom we're going to start with a 50-50 mix of ethanol and hydrogen peroxide okay and we're gonna set fire to that makes you then we're getting to add an additional oxidizing agent in the form of potassium manganate several times I phangan eight so if you can just like that yep and okay so that's all we're gonna do now is we're going to drop some of our manganate crystals on top okay and you'll see what happens oh yeah again the lovely purple flash sure they're going to Pebble again the cracking our tiny little pockets of intense burning and that's exactly how we create a crackle in a firework it's intense burn followed by a low energy burn intensive burn low energy but exactly as we've seen that that's really interesting well that's good brilliant there's this misconception with with fireworks are particular that they're too dangerous to do in the classroom and obviously there are certain things you cannot be classified but there's quite a lot that you can I think what we try to do today is show some fairly straightforward activities we've brought out the links to fireworks because there's lots as forces if the chemistry is the flame colors so there's a lot of stuff that you do generally in schools but it's just knowing what links to make the fireworks I think the keys doing any demonstration I'll just fire at demonstrations customers don't be afraid have the confidence to do it but you need to practice everything that we we've shown today is well rehearsed and in terms of health is safe to make sure you consult the cleat cards and the guidelines to handling different chemicals but also to make sure that you carry out a full risk assessment I've actually brought in some some commercial gunpowder here that's about the quantity that we need really that would fit on a sort of beer bottle let's look at that yeah okay it's probably best to do this in a few cupboard but obviously we want to be able to see it here I'm just doing it with a small rat ok so I'm Wallace dunmire well bat flame to the end of it like that oh nice good just lovely isn't it ok not playing smoke and it's that whoosh and you can turn it back on a nice purple flame there I spent a night so what's I showing us that's showing us it's classy was nothing else in there it easy Smith no check which is our oxidizing agent of course we've got so far and we've got carbon in there as well I've got a drinks cart in here with a bit of strongly string on if you just lift that up just at the bowling ball can't you see what happens huh it's spinning milling around okay this drinks carton has got four holes in the corner and that she mostly water dribbled out now but the holes are in the left hand bottom corner on each face okay so the water comes out and creates a little jet for little thrusters all of the fries this is our pivot points we've got in a moment so you can link to sort of turning forces and turning effects and this is exactly what happens in a Catherine Wheel you've got driving Rockets all rotating around a pivot point and that's creates our lovely Tony effect you can still go again again yeah beautiful that's lovely if you think about a balloon it's got a narrow neck we've got a reservoir there that's going to be released and the pressure will have a blast of air coming out that little neck is the rocket principle and action if you just let that go it's a bit yeah he's letting go off it goes okay though yeah completely out of control we have no idea where that's going to go but you can control it by making a very simple 9 rocket sure you aren't seem to me like this and you're gonna propel alone that's why I've got this really thin nylon wire across the room would put a drinking straw in it so we do the same thing again with blooms low blue note the balloon and we'll stick it on here but we'll put a clamp over the the mouth convert the balloon if I come around here the tape now one piece of tape should be fine right fact i would recommend if you do this again maybe try a sausage balloon okay goob right let's give it a go see what has to see let's release nice one I thought that is there any good for a first attempt I've run a little bit of ethanol around the inside of this film pot yeah inside just inside yes I'm keeping the lid on the mouth cause I want to keep the vapor in there I've emptied out the excess liquid so when a mixture of ethanol and air in there but I've also got two tiny holes in the top of this film right just there you just see and I'm going to insert the ends of this modified piezoelectric gas lighter now if you look I press that you can see it just arcing a bit and what we're trying to do here we're trying to ignite the vapor in here as the vapor burns it will expand it will pop off the lid and will actually end up sending something off and that's what we use when we fire shells roman candles it's this idea of fuels burning the gases expanding pushing something out I'm just gonna thread my electrodes in here so arm's length you ready oh and that's how it works well maybe jump I've got a stoichiometric mixture of oxygen and methane in this half liter bottle our mixture of gases is in there now as we light it move to the third law or guess it will expand without Jessica out here it's going to create off thrust say in the bottle that way so we'll place it on our stand there you can fire this that's you directly on the on the table surface but I'm gonna use a stands give me a little bit more directional control we're gonna send it over safety screens either side of our of our rocket now there's two ways of writing it and if you're a bit nervous you don't to put a flame on the end of a stick there you can use a piezoelectric device like this this is 1 i've modified it's a gas lighter I suppose makes a spike on that guys we're gonna do it in a bit slightly more interesting when he's on a flame Olga need is a flame oh dear right ok ok over here so if you get your eye protection if you want to light your splint right ok i will take the lid off the bottle here after we've bled the gases into the bottle a little bit of cling film over the end just to keep the gas I guess is in okay ready yep ok nice one go really good really gutsy feel where haven't you really fielder the field of shock wears off and then they're beautiful flash coming at the balcony the accelerating extremely quick chaos that's why yes definitely what we're going to show you today are some chemical reactions but the one thing that they all have in common is they're linked to fireworks where do you think you might have seen this before the main issues that you have on teaching there any science physics and chemistry is to get over those ideas in an exciting interesting way so the gas comes out of the back and what goes forward the rocket which famous scientist was it that came up with those laws of motion Newton Newton good the rocket really captured their imagination and they could see how the ideas of Newton's third law came in yeah that work I've been seen the pupils reactions to those experiments am certain i'll be using all of them in my future lessons and linking a lot of science and chemistry to fireworks so girls you've just seen mr. Forley doing the experiments what do you think I'll really good yeah exciting I like the rocket one unite the rocket well why didn't I rocket one because it was just more exciting as it was like nothing really electives this joke like it was like okay what was it about the sparkler that's pricey but it wouldn't really like cool down so quickly on the floor I would for just burn as soon as he touched it was but didn't I have to hand in to Trevor he's done really well we came in we sprung these demonstrations on him and send him off into a classroom but he's enthusiasm and passion for the

into it man we know we haven't done a review and so long I've been kind of trying to like you know since its first of all it's the end of the year so there's not really too many other cartridges to try out and plus I am if you guys didn't know trying to evolve my content I'm not only doing cartridge reviews anymore because I kind of want it I want to do more you know I want to do more stuff so that's why I've been expanding so I've been doing a lot more collabs and more hablok sessions a lot of [ __ ] that normally wouldn't you do right but I do miss those reviews man I do definitely miss doing reviews because I don't know I feel like since that's my thing that's my thing there's there's so many people out there that tell me what like you're you're the originator of the car reviews brother like I've been watching you you're the first one to with your car because I was like I mean I didn't say the people said it man I'm kind of happy you know that people kind of know me for that because you know that's that is where I started technically some reviewing cartridges and I'm kind of I'm so happy that you know I built I built this platform from literally just reviewing cartridges but like this thing is pretty amazing he's pretty amazing so it's getting straight into the room you guys today we got a special call I have a special collab man I've been waiting to review this for the channel for so long and if I was able to go out and comp a couple of these because these are not easy to find man these are not easy to find anywhere if you're in California if you're over the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal state and you just have this make sure you guys try it man because honestly it's pretty crazy so happening - they're so friendly farms cool friendly farms X alien lab - Cola this is the area 41 hybrid and then I've I've already achieved if you guys haven't watched my top 5 cards of 2019 that video is up in that video will be down in the description below but yeah like I said I cut I copped a couple of these and I already like I literally just started chipping around this this is by far one of my favorite cartoons you know just because the taste is phenomenal everything about this cartoon is phenomenal and all right so like I said I'm gonna slap it on here when you guys get it you guys are gonna get the black tip with a little alien engraving in it and full spectrum you already know the oils gonna be a little bit darker no need to worry though full spectrum if you guys don't already know what it is pretty much you're getting every single spectrum of the cannabis plant from the taste to the feel to every pretty much everything row all inside of a pen so that's pretty amazing so I know a lot of you like to see the packaging and stuff so let me go ahead and give you guys a little closer the close-up look honestly dude friendly farms is doing some sick-ass things with with their packaging because mostly all their packaging looks like this but this alien labs co-op specifically is pretty damn sick dude I'm not gonna lie this alien labs co-op box is pretty unique dude honestly in in terms of artwork it's pretty sick it's pretty sick alright now that you guys saw the close-up of that man let's get to chief and boys I'm pretty much in this review we're gonna be media as the full taste test with a full body effects high head effects all that stuff what I like about it what I don't like about it what I wish they would have done all that good stuff you guys already know how we get down with the review guys so I'm excited man I'm excited like honestly this is this is so this is a whole different type of cartridge like honestly the taste in this is such unexplicable like insane it's insane like I've never tasted anything like this so give me you guys the full rundown on this review so area 41 alien labs ex-friend firms let's get it cheers guys and by the way if you guys do end up copying the proprietary battery from the feliforms I do recommend using a green setting anything higher than that which is I believe like the orange setting it's too hot it's too hot you're burning it too much you're wasting your oil it's always good to get such a little a little lower temp but obviously you're still going to get the clock so cheers guys if you guys are over the age of 18 21 whatever it is in your legal state I don't want any little underage kids in our that stuff in here you know we can't even enjoy it so choose [Music] so tasty bro all right so that my battery literally just died after that second hit back with that first hit so if you guys didn't see too much of clouds it was because that my the battery is dead so when also that brings up to another topic if when you use it as battery I do recommend charging all the way because it makes such a difference man that hits our way Milky Way flatter when it's fully charged compared to when it's obviously low and low and battery so let's go ahead and test hopefully this is fully charged simple choosers you could definitely tell when it's fully charged man the hit is just so much more strong I dude I'm telling you alright if I had it compared I know I said that the taste is not it's very very distinct you know I can't really compare it to anything but if I had to compare to something it has to be fall under like the lines of the cannabis drive terpenes from Suzy like those pods are so Turkey and so flavorful and when you hit them they're just so gassy and you honestly only taste like the straight-up but dude you just just trade it like straight bud no no preservatives no additives into that [ __ ] whoo shout to hydro hydro flaps if he has her oh geez on the challenge guys know I've been having this thing since day one right so uh for that first first two second initial hit you know right off the bat I feel my eyes getting heavy and that's that that has a lot to say dude because those two hits were very very very small in terms of the vapor products that you know yeah so for it to have that much packing so it's such a little hit it's pretty crazy so and the taste like I said super gassy super Turkey you don't taste no oil as it doesn't taste boilie and all I can like dis lids they usually do and it's something that you want to keep on hitting honestly and something's just so distinct that you're like hmm well you just want to keep tasting it because you've never tasted it before so cheers guys let's go in for another hit and then right away you want to enter your lungs they're like the longest benches instant dude it instantly guy I want to coughing so and on that exhale I'm getting like a little like some undertones of you know how like when you take like a pretty wanna temp tab you get those little it's taste like Turkey dude it tastes like turkey warm Turks in there you know and it just like fills up and lingers in your mouth and it's like cow like like like if you just baked some lie president you feel me like not not not cooked it bake it it you know when you bake something you get that aroma you get that full flavor taste that's kind of like what like you know baking out here boys I know I don't know if that makes any sense but you know making up new terms every day so when you go in on another one man because this thing is phenomenal I can't get off of it so even what I know I said let's not go to higher setting but I just want to see I just want to see how it compares on this cartridge so choose oh yeah that is what that is definitely way too hot like it tastes a little bit more burn so than anything not even burnt but a little bit too hot in my opinion like a hot attempt ugh I like those little lower temp ones and honestly man I know I keep saying dab and this is a pimp but this pen literally makes you feel like you're taking a DAB and the funny thing is I've tasted their full spectrum salt and it's literally it tastes exactly similarly super super similar like this taste that this taste that friendly firm produces is very very unlike be replicable and like it's kind of like like just just straight-up fire dude I don't know how to explain it like the taste like I keep trying to like bring out what the what the pinpoint tastes this but I just can't I just can't mmm so like I said the hi man I'm definitely feeling it more drawn my head than I am my body and then again it we've only been pinning in for like five to seven minutes so I'm pretty sure the longer I wait the more I'll feel their effects and it's a good smoke man it's a good smoke definitely you know and something's so exotic this isn't something gonna be picking up on the regular man definitely not getting picking up gonna be picking this up on a regular bed because the price there the price range is a little bit more up there you feel me compared to other cartridges that's why a lot of people don't really mess with with filming phones because they go into the shot they see the prices and then they're like the bounce I'll go to rock garden whatever whatever the lower end price is you know so but if you guys are in the market you know got a little bit extra money that you know is there the Christmas and maybe you guys got some extra Christmas money and you guys are in the looks for new cartridge alien laps X from the forums definitely check them out so we're gonna end this review out here guys I know it's it feels a little bit different reviewing this time I don't know what it is I just maybe I'm falling out of the reviews you know I feel like a lot of people have been coming out of cartridges so there's not there hasn't really been a lot of search for a new cartridge reason I feel like the time that I got into it was perfect because I was when cartridges were popping you know I got my I got my people and I got my viewers locked down you know things like that I think it's time to now progress on to the next thing which is you know going out session event doing big big whole lives with bigger people mr. TC you has seen that collab with Edwin sparks you guys having go ahead and go check that I'll put that description below and you know which is we're just working man we're just working we're just we're still trying to find ourselves in this little wee tube thing because I wanna say this is still as a hobby I'm not taking this thing too serious and I don't plan on taking it too serious because honestly I have bigger things to myself and then just only YouTube if you me I got way big things I hope hopefully you guys get to see those things I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be able to bring them to YouTube soon enough and see ya guys well we're gonna have that video here if you guys enjoyed it go ahead and leave a like comment support let's try to reach 500 likes of yours Kim and they'll be amazing so we'll catch you guys later you do", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "H-mgfusUK-4": "[Music] [Music] what it do youtube man welcome back to the garden we're gonna do a quick little update kind of busy today but so yeah some of our seeds sprouted white rhino one and two both of those super silver haze we did have a little disaster moment [Music] uh one of our blue spanners tragically met its end so we put another one in here another bruce banner and uh one of our gorilla skittles sadly medics in so i didn't have another one so i put gorilla glue and be our other bruce banner hopefully one of these will pop soon some big news these are our granddaddy purple and as you can see [Music] they're rooted so i'll let those get a little bigger and then we'll put them in the soil and that's all that's going on in this tent let's move on over to our 3x3 and yeah look at that we put up our trellis we got two granddaddy purples one two two strawberry cups one two we went ahead and put up our trellis net this is how i like to grow i like to just bend stuff down into the trellis helps me get that canopy you see today will be the first day of flower for these girls they'll be going off at six got him lollipop up to a certain point and really all we're doing in this one is just spreading them out as they go we'll probably keep doing that up until the third week of flower um yeah giving them nutrients letting them grow you see nice and healthy super healthy thing in here looks really good oh there you go on a new update we're exhausting these tents out each one's got their own fan pushing it it just flies off to go out of the inlet but so we got that helping us control the temperature in here a little bit and in our three by three flowering granddaddy purple and as you can see we're in flush mode right now we're flushing all the leaves are turning yellow there's some monster colas it's a big boy now that's a big boy and you can definitely ah so so good you can definitely see the difference in these two phenols this one has more pointy cone shaped buds and this one has these round fat colas when they see these are more pointed but we're starting to get color in these leaves are actually getting purple so we'll see what actually oh that's so sticky these will be coming out pretty give you soon little tour of all the goodness yeah so these will be coming out next week probably depending on our trichomes i looked at them they're partly cloudy still got some clear in there not really any amber yet but as soon as we start getting that amp it's time to put in our little veg stand here [Music] we have our blueberries still doing their thing and we're still running this experiment these are being tied down lst and these have been super cropped and you can see those bins are nice and strong now got two little blueberries here and a pheno one granddaddy purple which is that one and yeah really that's always going on it's just slow boogie at the moment nothing really too exciting just getting it going i'm excited for this tent by the time it gets up to you know this is just gonna be a monster tent yeah just a quick little update y'all have a blessed day", "pJTpaNFMuMU": "hello ladies and gentlemen welcome back to weed stream it's myself here mr. matt CEO how's it going ladies and gentlemen just doing a little quick tutorial here so today we're looking at some new products that are on the market here and I'm not just meaning on the market but I'm meaning more or less inside of your dispensaries and your pot shops with that kind of stuff this kind of stuff I been kind of using in the past and I have been more switching to oils and vape just because I'm on the go more and like I said this kind of stuff is super super easy to use so I'm just gonna go over some stuff that here this um that you want if you see this kind of stuff get it I recommend it it's not the most expensive but it's a medium grade and they have newer stuff coming out in which I'm more interested in but like I said this is what I use and this is what I suggest because I find this to be the best so anyways this here is your straight straw it's your draw straw and this thing comes with a cool little charger that sticks into either your car or any USB outlet charging block I use it in my car i plug it into my into my USB port and it charges it in no time holds a really good charge glows cool red on the end it's a draw stick so it does not have any buttons which is one of my favorite things about it is it just instantly draws and yeah like I say it doesn't heat up it gets a little bit warm like every little stick does but it doesn't make it so hot and you want to have it a little bit warm anyways to kind of keep that oil coming down right you don't want it yeah you know what I mean if you use these so straight straws are good straight straws are not overly expensive and straight straws work for most and I'll get into what they don't work for but anyways they are very good with good supply and good supply is one of my favorite brands I don't know if you guys agree with me or not but good supply I like for their sativas I don't really take them for their indicas but there's sativas are usually fairly goodly priced this one here I believe was like $40 for 0.5 and like I said will go down it's a pretty good THC value we're sitting see we're gonna move that decimal point one point to the left so we are sitting at seventy five point two percent so about seventy five point three and our CBD well as you can see we don't even have a trace of CBD in there so we're looking at pure oil and these people use nothing while all oil companies that deal with extract distillate or honey oils they don't use no vitamin ease they don't use none of that stuff that is inside of your vapes that are in your store for tobacco companies like I said it's it's clean oil I've been smoking it most of the day today and I was a little bit grumpy when I woke up today but now I'm not so that tells you right there that this kind of stuff so I'm just gonna try and do this here with one hand which is kind of difficult let's see here sorry everybody I gotta get a better set up for this one of these days so as you can see your pen just slides on or sorry your cartridge just slides on to your pen just screws in five to ten thread everybody write five to ten thread make sure you say that to them or they say that to you in some form because that is exactly what what's going to get what you want to fit your your cartridges right so we'll just take it up here you can see you get a real nice draw from it it looks real nice you know what I mean you can clean it you can disinfect it you know I like this oil specifically because it's not a thick oil it's a nice honey oil you don't get that big blobs of bubbles in there and lose a lot of the oil up on the sides you have to heat it up and stuff so it's a real nice super good smoke this one here is pineapple express and I recommend pineapple express to people that are dealing with anxiety if you're pissed off if something's bothering you this kind of stuff it's got a lot of limonene in it and limonene is the turpentine or the terpene sorry that gets you nice and relaxed and happy you're gonna want to take this one if you're a little bit grumpy a little bit upset a little bit stressful in the day it's gonna make you feel energized to give you a little bit of that I don't give a [ __ ] type of attitude while you're inside and nice and happy so I would recommend this and like I say I appreciate you guys taking a look and I hope these reviews are helping you and there's gonna be more to come thank you very much bye", "ayDrTOrTnu0": "Oh guys back to do another review here I'm going to be doing blue dream dang crepes um get your message on the back blue stream blue stream is a sativa dominant hybrid originating in California has achieved legendary status among the west coast range crossing a blueberry indica with a sativa haze blue tree and bounces full body relaxation with gentle cerebral invigoration novice and veteran smokers consumers alike enjoy the low-level effects of Blue Dream which easier jumped me into a clean euphoria I believe this is a sativa dominant hybrid from what I was reading there what it did say I believe I'm gonna be using my fists bhasu well right off the bat you get this great haze just a little blueberry but not haze is definitely more potent not really beeping much um little chemically hmm well that's kind of disappointing thankfully this isn't these aren't expensive I'll end up I'm Doug either selling this one more maybe maybe all right thank you guys for watching my review of Blue Dream I don't believe this one's real already me me thinking this fake there's no need for me to keep going and taste alright it put its excuse me um it just don't it tastes alright it just don't meet pardon and the side was to pull out my Girl Scout cookies which I can cram the open real quick so I've been using this because I don't got the nipple on it and cuz I've been going through um yeah I hit this [ __ ] you will see instantly damn girl scout cookies making me cough just like that yeah there was a [ __ ] rip this one I think you guys for watching like subscribe if you're interested in them more videos to come and every stop and flavors never stopping flavors um there is something new on the list I'm getting it and one weird thing I seen wedding cake and birthday cake and I thought maybe one or the other was fake but I don't believe so and I've also seen Diablo G around I think you not only have to get some of that OG which I'm guessing this I don't see the hablo around a lot because probably because OG - Shandi ah blue kush are probably just about the same so yeah it could be a phenotype of OG Kush so yes you know what I mean I'm gonna get out of here thank you guys for watching", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "GGGW1xP3Uyg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "FYsD4BKoZJI": "[Music] what's going on guys welcome to another cbd video today we're going to be looking at some more of the goods vape pens so before i start the video i want to say to you guys merry christmas it is christmas day when this video goes live so i just want to send my wishes out to everyone i hope you all have a really happy christmas and also wishing you guys health into the new year into 2021 2020 was pretty crazy so i'm just wishing you guys some health and some luck into 2021 let's get on to the video i absolutely loved not only using these but reviewing these recently and they've come out with two new profiles they've got the stranana profile which goes on more of the chill side of things more leaning towards the indica side when it comes to effect and then you've also got the blue dream which they call the hustle side of things so you're looking at more of an upbeat kind of sativa-like effect so we've got both of these here i've been testing them out so let's show you guys what an unboxing is like of these pens and then we'll jump into a session and as you'll see this is a pretty simple and easy unboxing you've got all the key information that you're going to need on the outside of the box so if you want to read any of that you can pause at any point but when you open up the box you are going to see a nice little packet inside and the way that they present these pens just gives them that extra step of quality and cleanliness and you do feel like you're getting a clean product when you get one of these vape pens so easy enough get out of the box get it out of the packet and inside you have your disposable vape pen no buttons no ports no leaking no nothing and that is what the unboxing of these vape pens are like and we're just going to do a quick unboxing again to open up these vape pens get them out showing you guys i'll be using fresh pens in this video in fact let's just take the first hit of this blue dream terpine profile but first of all i just want to have a little smell because these vape pens do actually give off a nice little smell yeah i am getting a blueberry smell i'm smelling the distiller slightly so you are getting that slight cannabis smell that smells nice just get a nice big hit to start with wow i've got to say for a disposable throwaway vape these pens absolutely pack a punch i really like this blue dream and it's for a very specific reason and i brought up this point in the last pen video and i said that i felt as though with the grape ape and the maui that the terpenes were just a little bit too strong for my taste i wanted to taste the distal a bit more that cannabis taste i really wanted that to come out a little bit more and it didn't with the maui wowie and the grape vape but this blue dream they've got it that they've got a mix perfect because you're getting a really nice blueberry taste but it's nice and subtle it's not too heavy but the distiller definitely comes through a lot stronger with this blue dream pen so before we jump into the straw and anna let's do a little blinker to get this video going yeah oh you can really get some big grips with these pens and now arguably one of the best terpene profiles i've tasted when it comes to vapes and all sorts of stuff they need to just make an extract of this straw anna because this one really is a winner this straw nana from the goods the turps on this are just amazing and again i'm popping a fresh pen out of the packaging right now to show you that we're using fresh pens and that they hit super good straight out of the packet but before we do that let's do a little smell and there's a very specific smell that i get off this when i smell the pen just like this and it smells exactly like strawberry jam if you put your nose into a jar of strawberry jam that's what that smells like like exactly no different so yeah we haven't took a hit on this yet you just saw me rip it out of the packet so let's see how this drawn and uh hits straight out of the pack yeah those turps are special the distillate definitely doesn't come through strong with this terpene profile but there's nothing wrong with this terpene profile at all it's really sweet it's got almost like like a creamy taste to it like a strawberry cream that's kind of what the straw nana tastes like and as always go big or go home so let's start off a new stranana pen with a nice little blinker oh when you hit oh wow yeah when you hit these pens wow when you hit this straw nana on a blinker you taste the distillate oh my look at me i am a mess so if any of you guys didn't see the last video i did on the goods vape pens i'm just going to go over some basic information about these pens and what's inside them so each pen is going to come with 0.5 milliliters of oil and inside that oil contains a 10 concentration of turps in each pen and just as some information this is what they say the profile is for the straw nana i'm also going to turn the box around so if you want to read any of the information that's on this box you can do so by pausing and also on the bottom you are going to get a batch number and also an expiry date which is just amazing and i've got to say they smashed it out of the park with these two profiles the blue dream it's got our blueberry taste to it the distillate comes through nice and strong and the straw man that is just a sweet tooth stream i think this may actually be my favorite terpene profile out of the lot and now that the information is out of the way let's do a double whammy i'm not going to do a blinker on both of these because doing blinkers on each of these already has just broke my skull i think but let's just take a hit on both wow it still blows my mind that you get this vapor production from a pen that you throw away but that is something that i'm gonna bring up because my opinion hasn't changed on that since the last video i just hate the fact that you've got to throw these away these are really good quality vape pens and i'm sure there's no real way that you could fill them back up or charge the batteries that's what other units are for but it really does hurt me seeing all of this waste and and just just having to throw them away it really hurts to throw these in the bin but that is something that you have to accept with a product like this it is one use and get rid of and that's actually what it's perfect for as well there's no mess there's no charging there's no buttons you just chuck it in your handbag or your backpack or your pocket or wherever really these things can fit in pretty much ever anywhere they're absolutely tiny but that is what they're good for i hate the fact that you've got to throw them away and there's a lot of waste but i absolutely love how convenient they are they're so small they're easy to use you can just give this to someone who's never vaped before and it's all you could ask for the one issue that i have when it comes to vapes and cbd just in general is passing them to a friend and my friend having no idea how to use them there's 40 buttons you've got to use you've got to throw it 100 meters just to get it to power on with these you just inhale and it works i gotta take a couple more hits of this straw nana though there's been a lot of hype about this profile there's been a lot of people talking about this straw nana on instagram and i was wondering what all the hype was about but as soon as these pens landed it made total sense because this straw man that is special yeah that's drawn on it is special and there's something i actually want to talk about about these pens that i don't think i brought up in the last pen review and that is that these have absolutely saved me in moments when i've got too baked there's been a few smoke ups recently where me and my friends have just been celebrating getting closer to christmas and stuff and having some pretty heavy sessions and there was the one night where i was so close to pulling the whitey i was very very high and i was just uncomfortable i didn't enjoy it and i sat and vaped one of these pens for about 20 minutes i took about 10 hits on it and it brought me down i could instantly tell a difference i was really uncomfortable and anxious and a little bit paranoid about the high that i was on considering how high i was and i gotta say these saved me but that wasn't the only time these have saved me from some uncomfortable highs a lot recently i think i've been leaning on these a little too much in that aspect so before we take any more hits let's quickly talk about the effects of these pens not only these pens but the last pens i was using i'm getting very similar effects from you getting the chill profile and also the hustle profile so you get more of a sativa profile on the one side more of an indica profile on the other personally i feel there isn't a huge difference between these pens but there's definitely small differences between them that you will notice if you vape one or the other so the hustle ones i feel as though i get a very clear head like an energy boost i feel a little bit more uplifting and if i got things to do and i want a nice quick hit of pain relief i can use the hustle one but if i've had a hard day at work and i just want to come home and relax and again i want a super simple easy hit of cbd i'll grab one of the chill pens and that'll kind of just knock me back a few steps these don't completely wipe you out i wouldn't say that these are going to be a pen that's going to pull you to sleep after a couple of hits but i definitely find myself yawning when i use more of the indica style the more chill style profile so is there a huge difference between these pens when it comes to the effects and i don't think there is a huge difference you could vape these throughout the day it doesn't really matter but i do find definitely with the chill profiles that they do get me yawning they do kind of slow me down a little bit these pens have pretty much become my daily drivers as well i put one in my backpack when i take you to work and on my breaks and things like that when i just need a quick hit of cbd these just save me whether i'm in the office and i'm doing a little bit of editing whether i want to get rid of some of those little aches and pains that i've got or whether i want to just chill out or have a little pick me up these they're just a lifesaver i said it earlier but the simplicity of these does make them that much better than other products out there because they just pick up inhale put down it's that simple when i'm in work and i just need that quick hit a cbd i don't want to be messing around with dab tools or vape bottles or tanks or anything like that i can just take these out of my bag take a couple of hits put it back and i'm not wasting any time or effort a 20-second hit will give you all the cbd you need okay okay there's there's no way i can review two vapes in this video and do a double blinker so uh let's get the lungs ready and let's do this let's see what these pens really can do oh i don't know i don't know if the one went off but the other one did that straw nana is definitely my favorite profile the goods if you're watching this video please bring out an extract with this draw nana profile to it because i think that may just become my favorite extract as well then these absolutely throw clouds out and i say guys i'm all cbd i don't think i can make much more i'm pretty chilled out right now i'm sure you can see it on my face that these pens have hit me pretty nice i absolutely love these pens can't really say too much wrong about them there's no charging there's no buttons there's no mess i do hate the fact that you've got to throw them away but that is part and parcel with a disposable product but that is my review guys if you enjoyed it remember to leave a thumbs up put some comments in the comment section hit that subscribe button and i'll speak to you guys later [Music] you", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "SatkrtHn7Po": "howdy y'all dan scotland here joining you from legal massachusetts the heartland of america for today's episode we're going to be talking about another delta 8 cartridge um this one from the website earth grown wellness they're based out of connecticut um they have a number of different sales that i've been checking out um i got a cbd patch for them which i've been wearing it's been pretty it's it's pretty good it's um it was five dollars um i think it had like 15 milligrams of cbd that's supposed to last a day and i've been riding pretty easy this past um 24 hours because of it um they have a lot of good deals and a lot of good prices so if you live in new england and they're definitely a online vendor you should check out um i got all their stuff quickly and um if you spend over i think twelve dollars the shipping is free um so they're amongst the cheapest sort of cbd um delta eight places that i have seen in a while and i think them in medicinal dreams once more people know about them they're really gonna take the game away from the ten dollar cart folks but again that's just my opinion um i can be found anywhere you find podcasts such as itunes cast box stitcher google play store iheartradio other platforms like it you can follow me on twitter at ic sativapod and on instagram and i am canvassativa all right so this is uh 24k 24k punch i think it's a combination of 24k which is one of my favorite strains and um i think it's i think it's also combining purple punch but the name the the the the strain name stays true to what it is um it does i do taste hints of both of those strains um when vaping it um i i i vaped it for a little bit yesterday so you know i'm sort of coming at it with a little bit of experience here so all right so this has been unscrewed and put in for the past day or so so this time i'm going to review it for the first time on air very terp rich very very sort of flavorful um doesn't feel too like thick or cheap or anything i'm pretty feeling a pretty rapid onset body high right now um very tasty um sort of like like fruity with some gas um a little bit of like lemony knife i i feel again from hellfire um you want to qr code them or whatever pretty strong pretty potent pretty smooth but again like like most if not all delta a carts you don't want to really take big hits because it's going to be harsher across the board than delta 9 um it's it's just just the the way the cookie crumbles with that cannabinoid all in all pretty pretty darn good um again the name of the company is hellfire delta eight vape cards don't know where they're based out of probably out of like california or something i don't know but at any rate um if you live in new england if you live in in the six new england states and you need delta eight products or you need affordable cbd products and you want to get them quickly i would definitely check out earth grown wellness i'm not being paid by them to review them i've just i've just been hearing about them from the various subreddits and um i missed their their sale i think couple months ago when they when they had three cheese that um graham carts writing like 20 bucks when usually it's like 50 bucks on the official 3g website so again lots of top shelf um products there their patches i would i would get in on them before they sell out completely five bucks for 24 hours of relief of if you haven't had a canvas patch they're amazing you know they're very you know um if you have pain chronic pain issues or you have anxiety issues you just feel this warm blanket the whole day um with this patch so again i don't want to keep this episode too long as always i can be found anywhere you find podcasts such as itunes cast box radio public tune in i heart radio other platforms like it can be found on twitter and i see sativa icsativapod instagram i am canvassativa and as always everyone stay medicaid my friends peace out and ciao", "77cMjfd0nus": "what do you - we

here just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "5r7-z1DRz1o": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video this was actually part 2 and I give a shout out to my boy Christian who actually requested this video you know I feel like when someone requests a part two of a video I'll try and do my best to provide that for him and also I'd like to shout out my 15 members you know I haven't shouted them out in the video lately so for all 15 of you thank you I'll post them right here and all that stuff but getting on to the main topic of this video is fake cartridges obviously you know there's many fake cartridges that have basically just faked from a real company you know we got raw guard and brass knuckles all that stuff and every now and then you get other companies that just come out nowhere that may have been legit kinda cleared I mentioned in my first part video and then another one where one of you guys mentioned that there's another card called Lions breath something popped up in my reddit and for another thing when it comes to fake cartridges and you're very unsure of if you have a real one or a fake one just look it up online and ready is a very very good source for basically anyone uploading their opinion on the cartridge so it's easy to find if these cartridges are faked or being faked QR codes are fake or whatever but the other car in question is called Lions breath and these look pretty legit too QR codes holographic stickers all that [ __ ] and it's very hard for people to tell if that's legit or fake and honestly in my opinion I haven't seen that it like near me I haven't heard of Lions breath until I made that other video on the fake cartridges so I feel like it's my duty and other cannabis content creators to make videos spreading awareness on you know all the fake cartridges that are possibly out there so we can say hopefully save someone's lungs from permanent damage you know I'm not saying they're all bad but when there's so many fakes out there is it really worth the risk you know and this is not this is like he's like counterfeits and fakes aren't like you know if Louie Vuitton or fake then you buy something it doesn't affect your health you know it doesn't even affect your bank account as much as a buying a real Louie Vuitton would you know that's why people buy fakes but when you talk about fake cartridges this is something that we consume that we ingest so it's a very real possibility that maybe you might get permanent damage smoking nice you know backyard cartridges you know and I want to spread awareness on this as much as I can you know I don't really but I like making these videos but I feel like it's my duty as a cannabis content creator to make videos like this so that the public is a lot more safe when it comes to purchasing just anything cannabis you know I feel like I want my channel to be where like people will go to to find legit products just have a good time in smoke you know and hopefully I'm getting close to that goal every day you know I try and you know every now and then I try to make these videos you know and like I said Christian Torres requested a part too so I'll do my best to do it this is not going to be the only video uploaded today this is going to be the first video uploaded today and then I have another UFC video from like a week or two ago that I want to upload so yeah definitely stay tuned for that this is not gonna be the only video you know as much as these videos are important I know that not everyone watches them you know they'd much rather prefer like a smoke session or a vlog so I got you two videos today but this one's gonna be the first one because I feel like this is very important I should really get it out there and yeah shout out to Christian be aware of Lions breath carts you know I'll post it right here this [ __ ] looks pretty legit holographic sticker all that stuff but in that reddit post that came up it said that it was probably the worst tasting cartridge that he's ever had so just you you know as much as packaging influences your opinion on the product you still gotta be careful you know even though the packaging looks so [ __ ] legit you know you gotta be careful and best way to avoid you know getting fakes is to buy from a reputable dispensary if you're in a legal state I mean you didn't have to wait until you know cartridges are in your area but you know just be safe out there guys because permanent lung damage does not sound good you know saying so please if you guys have fake cartridges I'm not saying they're bad I'm just saying that there's a chance they could be bad you know there's a [ __ ] chance you know and it'll be pretty ignorant of you to say that there isn't a chance you know so just be careful other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video like I said there will be another video out today 4:15 p.m. peace out [Music] you", "C0I-fw0LvPM": "what's up YouTube welcome back extinct 420 here with another medical marijuana review got my new uniform today that's what took me so long to put out this next video yo your school shirt it's gonna be my new uniform for all my videos I might get another one I'll put the link in the description just the case you guys want one today we're checking out some of the cheapest the best vape pens you could get on the market right now coming from Liberty Health Sciences that's gonna be the THC count on that and then on this one this is gonna be a jack hair it's pretty good stuff I'm smoking on this you spin here I've had these a couple days so this is gonna be the gelato mmm tastes it tastes delicious these are the reason I say these are the cheapest is because these are $35 for 400 milligrams of THC and a lot of people they are misconstrued about how they sell them and whatnot dispensaries usually sell them by the milligram counts and not like half gram or grams like you see all these street cartridges have in Liberty Health Sciences is selling these which have 400 milligrams THC for 35 compared to true leave that it would be 47 for 350 or cure leaf which is they get a hundred and fifty for 18 or even move which has 250 for 35 or sir Terra which has 250 for 35 but that has a disposable pen with it this you have to have your own little vape pen I got this is for free from a friend of mine Wow it's killer right there mm-hmm you could check out the app hmm the oil in that stuff nice golden color it doesn't move you can hold it upside down for as long as you want it'll move eventually but all these cart Street carts are ugly and brown all right we're gonna try this Jack Harry this one's unopened this is what a car looks like fresh out of the pack 400 milligrams THC like I said this one it's got like a fruity taste this gelato got that delicious oh man alright we gonna try this Jack hare I didn't even tried this yet I had the flower in my last video it was pretty good I actually still have a butt of that left I'm saving it you know special occasion not so special occasion just saving it alright I'm already ripped you off that [ __ ] gelato you know I'm tell y'all what this does cuz I'm ripped definitely not like uh that one's like a citrusy taste that gelato this one has more of a berry taste man I'm ripped y'all the first batch I got which is this gelato had 75% THC the second batch 87% THC so I mean they're both really good yeah so there you have it guys these are definitely the best bang for your buck if you're going for any kind of dispensary cartridges in Florida I mean you could pay I mean yeah these people on the streets and say that oh I could get a gram for 40 or 50 but that's like of like Eric Conn says some hot dog water or something I mean hot dog water probably be better for you but I mean it's not that expensive look you off y'all get invest in your in your card which cost two hundred and seventy eight dollars and then you can get the $78 discount earth no $75 discount on $150 so I got five of these cartridges for $100 so that's that's two and a half grams for 100 bucks compared to these fake-ass half grams y'all get big-ass grams y'all getting for full 50 or 40 or whatever and this is real legit delicious dispensary lab tested quality stuff that's just you know my opinion my channel is here for people who are curious about getting their card and don't want to get ripped off or waste their money and don't know what they're getting because like you would like to see what they get before they buy it and none of these dispensaries show you any flour or any any cartridges that you can't taste it at the dispensary so that's what I'm here for guys but I'm gonna get off here I'm gonna smoke this Luke's tendo right here that's coming up next I mean I'm ripped but I like to smoke so I mean we don't get it and here check out the shirt y'all want it I'm gonna leave a link in the description thanks guys catch y'all next time", "fTD0-5_Q3g0": "this is the firefly mini 300 review of the all-in-one premium cannabis vaporizer og kush 0.3

guys for watching please go subscribe subscribe see guys next time", "HQEaaZwrV_w": "howdy ladies and gentlemen Jeff with that connection here bringing you another cartridge review this time it is jetty extracts JT gold and I am going to be doing the Maui wowie so the jig is pretty cool also just like we got this new is able to get a hold of this new vessel battery so getting rid of that little the little little cart that I was using their low key that I was using before just to make sure that we're getting the best that we can you know they want to review in these we're using the best quality battery that we possibly can so anyway the jetty extracts gold this is a half gram comes in this cool little cartridge here open it up and then in there you have a little baggie that it comes in give you this cool little jetty baggie and the cartridge isn't really cool actually its quality its glass nice metal ring it's a nice sea cell design this see you can see there's I've already had most of it there's a little bit left at the bottom but anyway it's really cool they have the the reed style but it's it's a nice wood mouthpiece which is really comfortable it's worked out well one thing I did notice about this particular cartridge out of the four that I ended up getting this wanted to go down a little bit quicker than the others alright so give it a shot now what I've gotten I like to describe before I go because I end up hacking but it's a really it's very potent what are they saying it is this is a eighty eight point three six percent so definitely get you hacking and it's very powerful its uplifting but the flavor is really well-balanced it has that that fruity really tropical fruity flavor up front and you can taste the the citrus to kind of following after but exactly what you'd think of Maui wowie which is really one of my favorite I've always loved Maui wowie so I was pretty happy to get this one um but that's about all I got as far as words are concerned let's go ahead and show you guys how this thing fits that's one cool the pan will actually turn off this vessel if you're not using it it just shuts down you have to get it going again I have it set on blue which is medium [Music] really look at it", "tB8SWgoX-HA": "[Music] hey guys close here with great counter crafts so today what I'm talking about is Delta eight THC so Delta a THC is one of the many cannabinoids found in the plant which there's over a hundred but the well-known the best well-known cannabinoids in the plant are the only two of them that are is THC which is Delta 9 THC tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD which is cannabidiol so THC is gonna give you that big psychoactive effect where what where CBD is gonna be more for inflammation non psychoactive but Delta 8 THC is so this cannabinoid was actually released in 2017 but was known about it since 1975 so Delta ATAC so the differences between Delta H and Delta 9 THC so Delta 9 THC it binds to your receptors so so cb1 receptor and cb2 receptors where Delta 8 th see only mainly binds to to your cb1 receptors so cb1 receptors are mainly in your central nervous system and central nervous system where cb2 receptors are in your immune system your organs throughout your body so what has been what so what what the difference is - with Delta 9 and Delta a THC so Delta 9 is gonna give you that big psychoactive effect and get you high where Delta a THC is gonna help more with anxiety so people that that smoke sometimes they get anxiety when they smoke this will not give you anxiety it'll just get you high but it won't give you that ah Guinness on in your head we're also the m''i THC is found so little in the plants that they actually I has to be done with it has to be through concentrates so you're going to do cartridges or any other concentrates that they do and it's really clear where Delta 9 THC about 25 percent is found in the plant Delta a THC there's only point zero one percent that is found in the plant so that's why they have to do it has to be in concentrates but yeah this is awesome for anybody that that doesn't that sometimes gets hot it gets hot but it gives them paranoia anxiety this is perfect for anybody to do anybody that wants to get uplifted but doesn't want to get that anxiety and I've heard a lot of people that get high and get anxiety so usually it's in cartridges but so I'm one of them that I've seen is about 80% Delta a THC and 5% Delta 9 THC so yeah the biggest difference is that the where it binds in your body and doesn't be it helps with so a Delta a THC it helps with nausea anxiety it said said to be helpful for Alzheimer's I've got this I've been reading about this so it's like I'm not getting it out but I'll put the I'll put the link of the article and down below so you check it out because it's it's a new cannabinoid and it's supposed to be really how go for like medicinal purposes so yeah check it out and we'll see you later Church", "yyMlciZZTA4": "hey guys Caitlyn welcome back to my channel I actually have a really exciting video because today I got a package in the mail so I actually ordered this off of a website called hemp face if you want to check them out I will link them down in the description kind of it's like more price on the pricey side but honestly if it helps you then it's worth it's worth the money at least for me CBD it's all CBD so there's no THC in this and it's legal in all 50 states I got the mimosa recover so it's supposed to be really relaxing CBD is actually really good for like anxiety depression pain so so let's open it so this is what it looks like when you open it it's disposable so once the battery dies once this little battery this little light stops flashing and the cloud dies that's it you just throw it away and it's recyclable so that's pretty cool they're pretty eco-friendly so it doesn't come with a charge or anything because it's disposable [Music] tastes really good it tastes like I can't remember it tastes like an essential oil that I've used before I [Music] actually really like these does my first time ever using them and it's a cute little pen like it's it's got some weight to it it's durable like it's gonna last you so these are good up to a hundred puffs I think and that's if you're not taking the full puff if you take the full puff to where the light blinks it's probably only gonna give you like 40 plus total before it's gone I won't be hitting this all the time because I usually use my my mod so I'll probably end up using this only sometimes when I have anxiety [Music] but they are kind of on the pricey side this cost me $35 just for this for recovery so if you drank all day yesterday and need a recovery hit up hemp-based that could help you they have like four different types and all different flavors [Music] you know I really like this little pin this is nice I'm feeling it I feel pretty relaxed [Music] hey take it along hit because our way your lungs absorb it and you get the full effects [Music] that's it for today's video maybe I'll go buy all the flavors of hemp bass including another one of these to do a review and all of them if you guys liked this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe and comment down below what you if you want me to do another one of these cuz I really enjoy doing this this is actually really nice subscribe if you want I'm pretty cool and I will see you guys later bye guys", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "i2lcDMOfKwI": "hey you guys I noticed it's been a long time since I've made any videos but I wanted to show you guys what I've been smoking quite a lot of which is the brass knuckles cartridges right here I did buy one of these vaporizer pens while I let go for these little wax cartridges they're very portable they don't leave like a smell and a resin and they're the flavors are amazing they're really strong too this one says a lab tested contaminant free no polyethylene glycol or glycerin it's a gram you guys and this one says blueberry of course so they've been the other flavors that I've tried like Girl Scout cookie and or rather cookie and what was the other one gelato were amazing so I have really high expectations for this all right you guys so I guess it was stuck so I did get it unstuck so now what I did was I grabbed my like a pin and pushed it down into the side right over there and now I can just push down on both sides and go ahead and pull it apart so there we go again this is the brass knuckles blueberry indica and it's pretty big cartridge you can see the brass knuckles logo on there that's pretty cool just opening the package the whole thing just reeks of blueberry so I'm really excited to try this given that it's almost Halloween I did wear a mass but let's see how this hits and how it tastes please remember to please remember to Like comment share and subscribe let me know what you guys want to see and give me a thumbs up and here's that brass knuckles Wow that flavor is amazing Wow so going that's really big hit still boy I don't smoke I don't know if the camera is picking up picking that up at G's the flavor is amazing it literally tastes like like a very smoothie like or maybe berry ice cream as you can see it hits really really smooth that didn't cough or anything at all or need to and that was a really big hit so I'm gonna go ahead and let's turn the heat down and then I'm gonna set this is my absolute extracts pen by the way it's really nice it's got the three different heat settings so I'm changing that by pressing down on that three times and that indicates or the color indicates the temperature settings so I'm gonna go ahead and press it twice which is gonna keep it on for a pretty good amount of time without having to hold the button and I'm gonna take a really big rip I'm gonna be really actually already really baked again like comment give me a thumbs up subscribe hopefully I should be making more videos soon and doing a giveaway it's been way too long so I'll get something cool for you guys and one or two lucky winners will get something so the flavors like overwhelming it's it's not over well I mean given that I'm already high it's already it's yet it's overwhelming this is definitely strong and really I hate already it's just you like breathing it out through your nose and just breathing it you know at all or you can taste it like even on your like lips and stuff that the blueberry and that like it tastes like berry ice cream like I said still blowing out smoke all in all I would give this a thumbs up five stars just like the other brassknuckles cartridges I've tried so far their flavor on them is really amazing they're always consistent they always burn all the or they always go all the way down to the bottom and you can use all the wax and you never get a burning taste through them and they're always consistent always delicious so I'm really excited to try their other strains they've got like seven or eight others that I know of that I'm really excited to try so I've tried the gelato the blue blueberry which is what this was and then also the cookies so their packaging is really pretty interesting I don't know if I quite show that it's got their branding and stuff all over it it's pretty cool I like it so I'm taking another really big ooh another really big rip and it's pretty much it like I said comment let me know what you guys want to see I'm over here and I have a lot of access to dispensary so I can get like cookies edibles waxes cartridges stuff that even you know but and show you guys and you know just try it out so have a great day you guys and here it goes a long space [Music] [Music]", "I2hvbm64YDI": "hey i'm about to try this cbd vape pen for the very first time

what the oh there's that hey it's that cbd that's that help okay and only i'm tripping because they had a um they had the um the other ones i tried before i forget the name of the monk the essential oils one god damn the essential oil once they don't hit like that you know what i'm saying like they cool they're cool but this right here is crazy because i mean just like the taste a lot of them fake things uh like i can't the i don't really taste it maybe the maybe because of the essential oil sticks i really couldn't taste but this is like my first cbd vape type product maybe the cbd hemp uh vape things obviously they hit different but let me do one more time now these are they say you're supposed to hit them like uh um one to two times as needed so i don't know what that mean i don't know how many puffs you get out of this by the way because this is a single use i'm just guessing anywhere between 200 to 300 uh 200 to 300 puffs i'm assuming okay and you can get out of this i'm not sure if i find i'll let you know uh i'll probably just do this maybe a couple times a day here and there just to see what's up this says it's a 500 milligrams i don't know if you can see that but this taste is dope though this pineapple this is dope you know what i'm saying like i said obviously i'm not feeling uh like i'm just so relaxed now maybe later it will be i don't know uh i'll do a update video down the road but let me just one more time just crazy yeah like you could really like that that pineapple taste that that smell i mean like pineapple so this is dope though i'm gonna mess with this for a while because like i said i'm gonna do it um because i just got some new gummies i'm trying out cbd gummies uh the dog going crazy but i'm gonna try this uh you know for a while just see if you do anything but like i said before i'm probably gonna keep messing with these because cbd hemp has has some sort of benefits to it uh that that i know of right and um so i'm probably just do these

alright Kristina thank you very much well", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works perfect for you for lots of cool products that you've

Britt Mason from humanity house CBD here aim on Indiana I've got Thaddeus with me hey we're just sitting here chatting a little bit and I was telling Thaddeus said one of the one of the questions a lot of people asked when they come in and I'm showing them products that you know they're becoming and they've asked about maybe a particular ailment that they're dealing with or whatever and will show them some of our products and some of our products listed list as an indica or sativa and so a lot of people are like well what what does that even mean I've heard that term you know in in the arena I've heard that term before over over the time what it what does that even mean so I was kind of asked at that what how do you how do you explain that to people when they come in so a lot of the times I think people think that has to do with the CBD levels so like people think maybe if it's an indica that means it has more CBD and if it's a sativa it has more THC and that's not really the case the hemp plant is more than just CBD or THC levels or cbn or all those cannabinoids there's also terpenes terpenes are actually what determine if it's going to be a sativa or indica so I got like a couple of our most popular ones The Incredible Hulk is probably our most popular sativa product and then the strawberry napalm of the Delta 8 by the way is polar most popular indica so say if you were trying out the strawberry Nathan for the first time how does read you the description do they have in the back of this and this is gonna be most generally like the best way to describe a an indica to put it a bomb to the senses this is the bodies of all of our Delta H strains it combines the heady motivated effects of Belt a THC with the same also relaxing terpene blend and we use for our comfortably numb' products so like they even set it there they use different terpenes to determine the indica side of and bran could read the description on the Incredible Hulk a cross between green crack and Jack hair strands so if anybody that those are two very common very traditional strands of cannabis out there and our people know the effects of those that are sativas so you get soothing happiness strapped to a rocket ship great for getting stuff done socializing and anything active this might not turn you green but you're gonna feel like the good monster yeah so again uplifting Zack you know maybe more of a daytime thing you know sateen yeah I mean another way I like to describe it to people is uh it's kind of a funny way to remember it is indica in the couch so it means you're more relaxed or chilled out you want to lay back watch a movie that kind of thing and then sativa I'd use that that s-sounds sativa stimulant now it's not a stimulant and the indica is not a depressant but that's the easiest way I like to explain to people in the most basic terms and there's so much more that goes into all this and we won't go into that embassy actually in a week or so we're gonna meet with one of our vendors here in Indiana up in Lafayette Indiana in northwest part of Indiana where all of our farm ground a lot of our farm ground is one of our vendors that grows our hemp goes the hemp that we buy has invited us to come up see their facility talk to them well there we'll get a chance really to talk to the guys that are growing this that can really tell us the the different even different terpene profiles on so and so forth that's that's not what we'll get into but anyway yeah that was that's kind of one of the great one of the one of the most common questions must come with so anyway I hope this helps a little bit you know if there's a lot going on out there come on in and see us will talk to us some more you can obviously reach us at humanity

going\u00a0\u00a0 to be doing a review for a delta 8 carts um as\u00a0\nyou can see here we just got our packet shipped\u00a0\u00a0 in from recreational eight and we're going to be\u00a0\ntalking a little bit about delta eight in general\u00a0\u00a0 and reviewing these cards specifically so yeah\u00a0\nlike uh jarrett said here we got this new package\u00a0\u00a0 from recreational eight with three little carts\u00a0\nfrom them um and you guys can make sure if you\u00a0\u00a0 like any products that you see in this video to\u00a0\ngo check out their uh their website it'll be down\u00a0\u00a0 in our description and you can also check out\u00a0\nour code it'll be code green fiends you can get\u00a0\u00a0 five percent off by using that code right there\u00a0\nuh and yeah go make sure you check them out um\u00a0\u00a0 so we're gonna go ahead and just rip right into\u00a0\nthis package y'all boys ready to do a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 of review all right yeah so we're gonna have rick\u00a0\nover here on the side doing a little b-roll of us\u00a0\u00a0 opening this up real quick for you guys so you can\u00a0\nget a little nice view of us opening this package\u00a0\u00a0 and while i'm opening this do you guys want to\u00a0\ntalk about a little bit what delta it is so the\u00a0\u00a0 viewers can get a little bit of knowledge about\u00a0\nwhat these products are that we're trying today\u00a0\u00a0 yeah uh the cool thing about delta 8 is it's\u00a0\nactually legal in all 50 states um it was recently\u00a0\u00a0 considered a schedule 1 substance but now it's not\u00a0\nanymore um it doesn't slow down your reaction time\u00a0\u00a0 as much as delta 9 your regular thc does and what\u00a0\ni noticed about it um when i was doing my research\u00a0\u00a0 on it is that it gives psychoactive effects\u00a0\nuh more than delta 9 thc in other words yes it\u00a0\u00a0 does still get you high yeah yeah it's it's it's\u00a0\njust as potent if not maybe a little less potent\u00a0\u00a0 it's a different height right it's definitely\u00a0\na different a different height it's more of a\u00a0\u00a0 spacey trippy height does look dope dude the great\u00a0\nthing about recreationally is that they do all\u00a0\u00a0 their testing on their products all that stuff's\u00a0\navailable um they send it in every package and\u00a0\u00a0 they're a registered llc in florida\u00a0\nthey have all their documents and\u00a0\u00a0 they're part of multiple organizations\u00a0\nrelating to hand flash hemp products like that before we start smoking on this a little bit um i\u00a0\nmean we did mention a lot of it already about what\u00a0\u00a0 delta eight is and everything um i just wanted\u00a0\nto go over a couple key points and just that\u00a0\u00a0 uh pretty much delta eight uh it's completely\u00a0\nsafe and as long as you're getting it from a\u00a0\u00a0 reliable vendor who you know is trusted and does\u00a0\nhis work does the test and make sure that they're\u00a0\u00a0 trying to provide a safe product for you and not\u00a0\njust a cheap product uh then it's completely safe\u00a0\u00a0 to use delta eight and has not many side effects\u00a0\nwhatsoever you can do your own research on that\u00a0\u00a0 on your own time obviously i don't recommend\u00a0\neverybody just go out and try this in the blue\u00a0\u00a0 but it is completely legal in all 50 states as\u00a0\nwe mentioned and this can help you with loads\u00a0\u00a0 of things from pain to eating disorders et cetera\u00a0\nand another great thing is it gets you [ __ ] high\u00a0\u00a0 i mean that that's great cbd or anything like\u00a0\nthat it still get you hot but delta here we go that's some clear oil yeah seriously i wonder\u00a0\nwhy delta 8 is a lot clearer while like regular\u00a0\u00a0 cards are like the dark oh bro that's a good\u00a0\nquestion bro that's fire dude good flavor yes\u00a0\u00a0 that's actual fire very like i swear to god

] like that holy [ __ ] that is a fire ass cart dude that that surprised me honestly i thought\u00a0\nthat was gonna taste like a little turp down\u00a0\u00a0 you know not as gassy but dude that was a good\u00a0\u00a0 dude that's no joke that shouldn't be in the\u00a0\nface like i probably just hit a dab on this bro we are smoking on that pineapple express sativa\u00a0\nright right now that [ __ ] hit me in the face\u00a0\u00a0 that actually i feel like i hit it [ __ ] really a\u00a0\nhybrid sativa god damn right damn you can already\u00a0\u00a0 tell right yeah you can already tell even if you\u00a0\nlike were skeptical about delta eight getting you\u00a0\u00a0 high the first [ __ ] hit you can tell like right\u00a0\nabout like this [ __ ] has thc in it really well\u00a0\u00a0 i mean a lot of stuff that they sell most drops\u00a0\nnowadays they turp it down and that is not that is and i will like to say that that immediately\u00a0\ngave me a head high like i was okay we had\u00a0\u00a0 a like a delta eight cart that we got\u00a0\nin the past that we actually got from\u00a0\u00a0 a local smoke shop around here and i'll\u00a0\nsay that compared to that cart right there\u00a0\u00a0 was complete garbage like yeah yeah for real\u00a0\nlike that that we tasted that cart tasted like\u00a0\u00a0 burnt popcorn had no flavor to it and honestly\u00a0\nthe first couple times i tried it yeah for sure\u00a0\u00a0 the couple first times i tried it it didn't\u00a0\neven get me that high and like that part right\u00a0\u00a0 there one hit straight to the face all right\u00a0\nso we're about to try uh the gelato hybrid now\u00a0\u00a0 we had to switch out the batteries real quick\u00a0\nbecause other battery died but test this [ __ ] all right this is july right yeah dude that tastes\u00a0\nexactly like a bomb pop like um like immediately\u00a0\u00a0 like that was the first flavor i got like coming\u00a0\nin from a [ __ ] hot summer day to grab a bomb hop\u00a0\u00a0 out of the freezer like that's exactly what that\u00a0\n[ __ ] gelato tastes like i believe here oh my god that really it really [ __ ] just\u00a0\nlike a bomb pop right god damn\u00a0\u00a0 it does taste like a bomb pop\u00a0\nthat [ __ ] [ __ ] hits bro god that tastes good it does taste like a\u00a0\nbomb i'm telling you bro just like like i like i like i still like the pineapple express a little\u00a0\nbetter just because i like how the turks\u00a0\u00a0 taste a little more natural but that tastes\u00a0\nreally good smoking on this indica right here\u00a0\u00a0 skittles skittles skittles and i know you all mentioned this but\u00a0\nagain i really appreciate vincent for\u00a0\u00a0 sending us each strain so we can\u00a0\nget a [ __ ] test of a hybrid\u00a0\u00a0 in the cut and a sativa yeah i needed a sativa\u00a0\nunless they got me up express smack me yeah dude\u00a0\u00a0 that tastes just like skittles bro like\u00a0\nit initially tastes just very sweet\u00a0\u00a0 and gassy but then the aftertaste tastes just\u00a0\nlike skittles and i love the camera and added it yeah that's really that's just that's and you and\u00a0\nit's like the tint of weed in the back of it too\u00a0\u00a0 bro i was fire yeah dude that is amazing yeah all\u00a0\nof these carts i feel like i just did a [ __ ] dab\u00a0\u00a0 i've hit like five i've gone like four\u00a0\nor five hits now and this room is smoked\u00a0\u00a0 out i'm too fried right like i'm fried\u00a0\noff like four or five hits dude so yeah\u00a0\u00a0 you can't beat this right here dude i'm telling\u00a0\nyou right now that we just did a our last video\u00a0\u00a0 was a full-grain part and sitting and i honestly\u00a0\nwas like close to this height like after the end\u00a0\u00a0 of the video like and i've only hit this like\u00a0\nfour times all right guys so i mean after trying\u00a0\u00a0 all three of those strains i think we've got like\u00a0\na good you know comparison of the carts and we've\u00a0\u00a0 all got like a good try of and everything i mean\u00a0\ni'm pretty geeked right now um so what we're going\u00a0\u00a0 to do now is we're going to toke on this a little\u00a0\nbit more and we're going to be talking a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit about what we thought of not only the delta\u00a0\n8 cart but specifically the recreational eight\u00a0\u00a0 delta cart and also um our favorite strand as\u00a0\nwell so we start with jared jared what did you\u00a0\u00a0 think of the cart and the company and also what\u00a0\nwas your favorite strand out of it well first off\u00a0\u00a0 the favorite strain was probably the gelato\u00a0\njust because it i think it had the most\u00a0\u00a0 taste compared to like the other two and like the\u00a0\nterms of the sweetness and it actually tasted like\u00a0\u00a0 a blue rasp on top more than i think the\u00a0\npineapple express tastes like pineapple\u00a0\u00a0 but i i think the skittles was the one that got me\u00a0\nthe highest i think that one was the most it felt\u00a0\u00a0 like the most potent out of the three definitely\u00a0\nthat indica hit hardcore recreational eight in\u00a0\u00a0 general i feel like they really know what they're\u00a0\ndoing whenever they're taking these cards and\u00a0\u00a0 i i know that they know they're testing and\u00a0\nsomething but this this like actually made\u00a0\u00a0 me feel like i was getting geeked on a real car\u00a0\nyeah for sure oh yeah i'm gonna take another hit\u00a0\u00a0 off this you're gonna straighten out all right\u00a0\ndrew all right um the strand my favorite strand\u00a0\u00a0 would definitely be the uh pineapple express i\u00a0\njust feel like that tasted the closest to a dab as\u00a0\u00a0 you can get it just tasted natural like like just\u00a0\nstraight weed i mean the turps tasted like weed\u00a0\u00a0 and everything and that's what i look for i mean\u00a0\ni just i love that we taste man um so yeah they\u00a0\u00a0 all had a nice gassy taste to them the pineapple\u00a0\nexpress especially did like that one just tastes\u00a0\u00a0 like a straight down and um the company\u00a0\nrecreational a i think that they're [ __ ] awesome\u00a0\u00a0 on quality uh you know they got quality products\u00a0\nthat if you looked at the um carts when we got\u00a0\u00a0 them they all had the same amount of uh discipline\u00a0\nin them that you know it wasn't like they were\u00a0\u00a0 jugging on you know what what they put and what\u00a0\num it's pretty cool packaging it's sealed up\u00a0\u00a0 you know um the tips are really cool they're\u00a0\nlike this this uh chrome kind of deal\u00a0\u00a0 i like that i mean i've never seen anything like\u00a0\nthat so they're very different from everybody\u00a0\u00a0 and yeah i mean it's just overall quality that's\u00a0\nwhat i look for and i mean it's nice yeah you can\u00a0\u00a0 go ahead and talk about what you want to say\u00a0\nabout them all right yeah so i mean for me the\u00a0\u00a0 pineapple express definitely that's like my\u00a0\nfavorite strand of all time anyways but like i\u00a0\u00a0 mean that one in particular not only did it get me\u00a0\nthe highest but uh i mean it tasted you know the\u00a0\u00a0 best at all just like drew said it had like some\u00a0\nreal good like pineapple aftertones to it which is\u00a0\u00a0 what you look for when you're smoking pineapple\u00a0\nexpress but it did taste like weed still too\u00a0\u00a0 and mainly that [ __ ] felt like i hit a dab\u00a0\nwhen i hit that like it really [ __ ] very good\u00a0\u00a0 so and recreationally dude like i've had some\u00a0\nother delta egg carts and they were they were\u00a0\u00a0 pretty good but i've never had delta eight parts\u00a0\nlike that like this is the most official built-in\u00a0\u00a0 carts i've ever seen i mean i can't say nothing\u00a0\nbut good things about this company so shout out to\u00a0\u00a0 vincent for sending this appreciate it yes sir um\u00a0\nand all i gotta say is uh my favorite strain was\u00a0\u00a0 just like gelato was for the flavor hands down i\u00a0\nreally love blue or bomb pops those are like some\u00a0\u00a0 of my favorite popsicles so that just hit home and\u00a0\nhad a very like reminiscent taste uh but for the\u00a0\u00a0 high definitely again i agree with jared on that\u00a0\nskittles that indica hit me straight to the face\u00a0\u00a0 some none of them punched me like that indica did\u00a0\num but it was amazing all around love the carts uh\u00a0\u00a0 i did try one of their connected uh what was it\u00a0\ni don't know what brand they had off the top of\u00a0\u00a0 my head but i did try one of their delta eight\u00a0\ncarts in the past and wasn't near the quality\u00a0\u00a0 from these carts this actually got me seriously\u00a0\nfried i can definitely feel it was potent and had\u00a0\u00a0 a great taste um another thing i will say is uh\u00a0\nrecreational light they're a very safe company to\u00a0\u00a0 go through they've been doing this for a long time\u00a0\nuh all of their things have all of their carts\u00a0\u00a0 have batch

video big thanks peace", "SXMTTO5fcQs": "hey there everyone welcome to my channel and if this is your first time here welcome my name is Courtney Crosby I currently live in Portland Oregon working in the cannabis industry and I want to share my love of the cannabis with you all but before we get started got a little Bowl packed here if you want to join alone that be awesome [Music] your best resource for smoking without the smell is going to be cartridges there are a few different types and styles of cartridges I mean with a prequel Tabar battery this is going to be my favorite battery that I have and it comes with the battery itself a charger a micro USB charger which I love about this battery two different bottom pieces for your cartridges that you had attached to the bottom of your cartridge to make it a magnet connection to the battery itself a few different cartridges to this battery and show you how well it works and everything screw this little bottom on the metal bottom piece on here making it a magnet connection to the battery and see so it doesn't fall out which is really nice look at the button five times to turn the battery on and off you can also double click the button here and it will do a pre heat setting which is really nice if you've ever had your battery laying on the side and all the oil has run to one side of the cartridge or it's just really cold and your cartridge and the oil inside is really cold you can put that pre heat setting on and it'll preheat the cartridge in together ready for use which is really awesome also has a temperature gauge up here at the top which is really important three cartridges to burn at different temperatures also when you set your cartridge down on the lowest temperature you're gonna go through your cartridge a lot slower it's also gonna taste a lot better so if you have your cartridge turn all the way up on high which is good for some cartridges to work or to lay other cartridges it'll just taste really burn you'll actually burn your cartridge and sometimes it can actually pop through the top of your cartridge and burn you which what you don't want on our cartridge oh just turn it down I can help with things like that so I'm gonna hit this bad boy and show you what it can do [Music] so taking this metal piece off and transferring it to you let's try out this buddy's cartridge these specific cartridges you can tell there's a little bit different we got two different mouthpieces here also the different types of oil on the inside which is really important just depending on what kind of cartridge you want I'll specifically really like the flat tips because you can hit it from any direction where is these tips you can only get it from the front or the back you have a specific battery with a button on it you have to hit a specific direction that can be difficult if your cartridge is in at a funny angle I just transferred the metal piece on to this cartridge here so it is now a magnet connection to this battery here so it doesn't fall out and you try it with this cartridge [Music] moving on to evolve I have their living resin cartridge and their battery to go open up this battery check it out another micro USB charger which is really great just plugs in down here on the bottom which is really awesome it says evolve across the battery with a nice button [Music] a button for your battery is also really important because some cartridges actually require a button it kind of just sends the signal to the cartridge saying okay it's time to warm up and activate the cartridge so some cartridges actually require a button on them some batteries are just a pull-through battery some cartridges work with those but not all cartridges do the last battery that we got here this is going to be a disposable battery so the battery comes with the cartridge you don't have to buy them separately just really great but once you're finished with that you would actually recycle the whole bad boy together so let this one it will be one of those pull through batteries it doesn't have a button on it or anything this is the Nano here there's also this type of a battery here that also has the button but also has a screw on USB charger on the top really great if you're looking for just an easy accessible battery on the go most of time these bad boys had lifetime warranties on them but unfortunately most the time if you lose this charger please piece in is irreplaceable that is why I like the micro USB chargers it a lot of these bad boys gone here [Music] please let me know down below what you thought in today's video I'm going to have any questions tips or things to add please let me know I love to hear about it thanks for watching and I hope you all have a great day", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a time right now we're portable vaporizers are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "JHuSstnceBE": "do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "BMSzf_bzJ14": "and how's everyone doing today we're gonna be doing a cart review and this one I'm actually quite excited for it because I bought this just yesterday its indica Skywalker the eureka cart these ones are really high in potency and this is coming in that THC level eighty-seven point fifty-two percent THC mg at 875 points to mg CBD point twenty six and more CBD mg coming in at a whopping two point six feet before this vapor cartridge now we're gonna be unboxing it so it is but put some close-ups on the screen for you guys I love the box here because it actually is a really nice box I don't think you just will end up to the camera really does it justice so exactly a sense of what you hope you guys enjoy this for other people we just had you orgasm you I really do you don't really digging this packaging Buddhist oh my god its packaging you don't really get that you must get them in a vial or something this is how they normally are open so foggy we are going to a he's faking his reviews these things come like this artisan so this is the cartridge here it is a clear oil as you guys can see it clearly obviously explained the title of the video yeah it's real cart we're gonna try to get on this booze penny at really trying it at three point three votes if you guys can see that they're hittin this bad boy alright alright its baby boy hopefully you guys were big along with me and it's can to hit in this car [Music] [Music] first impression all right first impressions of this really good this is a really nice strong pool I like it it's a it's a really nice pool body's pretty thick I like that adds a really pungent and same taste to it this guy Walker by the way but now already mentioned that already but um yeah okay well after those two shitty ghosts um I like said this oil is pretty freakin dank it is pretty freakin fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits me in the face when I'm just too baked and I'm really baked right now so hopefully you guys did enjoy this video leave a like comment and tell me how you guys are doing on this quarantine and yeah it's been your boy visa", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "qhSRUwzR3Ko": "[Music] smoking what's good guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video i have a reddit can ready cartridge this is uh a cannabis extract this goes on my good supply vape and we're gonna be trying this out [Music] it's a og kush cannabis train today i've tried out the og kush i've reviewed it on this channel you can check it out i'll put a link in the description down below but today we're going to be checking out the ready cartridge by the company ready can og kush so without further ado let's get started so like i said here we have the ready can and the ready cartridge 510 uh thread it's it has a net weight of 0.5 kilograms the net volume of the contents inside of it is .45 milliliters it has 790 milligrams of thc and has a total of 79 percent thc 0.03 cbd ingredients cannabis extract terpenes this is what i guess gives it the og kush flavor and yeah here we have the og kush and i can give you the back specifications here we have the warning symbol uh it says warning the smoke from cannabis is harmful toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found in tobacco smoke such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons aromatic ammons and an air tube and n heterocyclics are also found in cannabis smoke i don't know what the hell that means but yeah this is the warning sign there you have it uh so without further ado let's open it up um like this bang and here we have the cartridge the og kush cartridge and yeah let's pop it out yeah here it is with the cartridge let's pop out the seal bang wow and let's whip on cartridge and here we have it oh yeah perfect great success here we are thc logo the r logo i'm gonna be trying it out i'm not gonna be doing a blinker that's obvious ha ha [ __ ] a blinker and i'm turning this on and yeah cheers guys i'm gonna take a nice fat rip off this dab pan and yeah i'm gonna see if it tastes good doesn't taste good i don't know does it taste like og kush i'm gonna find out in like a few seconds so let's get it cheers i'ma let it preheat first my bad let's get it not bad not bad at all hold up yep get a little sip of my timmy here i'm not even gonna lie this actually tastes good i can kind of feel the taste of the og cushion it that og kush taste but yeah cheers let's take another hit yeah this is hitting pretty well i'm enjoying it as for now i'ma let the the high settle in oh no it's making me feel good good og kush i honestly i'm just curious to see if it's gonna give me that nice ogeekush mellow high yeah it's settling in what i like about wax the distillate that goes in this is that it's almost the insta buzz it doesn't take some time for it to settle in so yeah do you guys enjoy dab pens i don't know i'm smoking this right now because i just did my wisdom teeth and i'm trying to find the alternative as to like smoking harsh tobacco backwood smoke and yeah i'm trying out distillate for now well i guess wax dabs that pen and yeah it's doing the job right it's not hurting me too much i have a little bit of pain right now but yeah whatever i'm uh medicating myself with this you know what i mean yeah but it it tastes pretty good it's not too harsh um i mean i guess it has that og kush taste but like it's not as strong or prominent as smoking the bud itself like obviously there's some sort of difference in the taste of the distillate like i'm pretty sure if you'd give me like og kush distill it and like i don't know another strain and i'd be like yeah i mix them up right yeah but like if you give me og kush bud and you'd give me like rock star bud and compare the two i'd be like this one's oj kush this one's rockstar kush you know like i'd be able to taste it smell it and feel that this one's oj kush this one's a rock star you know i mean and this nah i can't really taste the difference mostly it tastes like distillate wax you know it tastes like concentrate um i'm gonna take another hit yeah i want to give you guys a close-up yeah so i'd recommend this pretty good i give it like a seven out of ten i'm no way shape or form also encouraging buying this product i'm not encouraging the consumption just saying it is a good distillate good taste in it's by itself is very good you know i mean the product itself is good um not gonna hate it too much i'll probably finish this like fairly quickly because my other 0.5 pod like finish in like a day or a day or two right i'm not complaining too much it tastes good it's just fun to puff it's smooth it goes in quickly it gets the job done it gets me high has thick smoke thick enough smoke for me right now because i can barely puff i'm not supposed to like suck in air you know but it's getting the job done that wax high you know i'm out here i'm elevated i'm stoned feeling good i hope you guys are feeling good too so yeah this was the og kush by reddit can here's the box oj kush recommend it if you have the time to go get a car or whatever try it out oj kush 18 plus never go wrong with og kush the high's mellow it's kicking in right and i kind of feel the same way kind of sedated that nice indica uh sensation but anyways this was oj kush if you guys enjoyed this video then drop a

on my Tiki yogurt and to be honest guys I like it I've tried it already um it's pretty good I love the taste and I know it's not fake I know it's legit cuz I did hear that some Takeo Kurtz could possibly be fake but you just got to watch out where are you getting it from you got to watch out you know you got to watch out who you're buying it from you know but there's a hybrid I don't know it says hybrid I don't know if it's indica or sativa but it says hybrid and I don't see that THC percentage but it says extra strength and the flavor is gelato it's a real fire guys if you live around this area guys like if you live around the area where they sell tequila cards or live East Coast get one get these get those cards because chances are they're legit and you can tell if the card is fake just by the taste of it just by the way how it hits you know but um here is my battery guys this battery wasn't cheap guys this was 26 bucks I paid 26 bucks for this piece of [ __ ] I mean it's not a piece of [ __ ] but it sometimes is because some carts don't actually fit on this [ __ ] but kikyo's some life cards actually did fit on this [ __ ] but most life carts didn't fit on my battery because the bottom part was too thick so that's why it doesn't it won't fit um and if you guys if you guys um screw around with dank vapes I don't recommend you guys buying dank beeps because there's like 90% chance that those carts are fake or actually 95% that they're fake because um people reported that um the air they tested those carts and they lab tested it and they found pesticides so you guys please be careful on what you're spending your money on because people some people can just be screwing you over and they don't care about you they care about your money that's all that's all what matters for them they don't care about your health they don't care how you risk it but it's up to you if you want to buy those cards but make sure make sure you guys know what you're getting

thanks for watching again and I'll see you guys in the next video guys peace out be safe", "mE1FUx5rhII": "ah my neighbors are so loud all right anyway hey guys welcome back to my channel but yeah hey welcome back guys so for today's video we are going to be doing a product line review oh let me get my notes hold on uh so today we're gonna be reviewing and going over slash demoing four products and that was eight to four products it's from a cbd line called hemp base they reached out to me a little over a month ago maybe two now to try out a couple products from their line let me just show you the products right now so they sent me two of their milk cbd oils this one is in this flavor cream soda and this is in cherry amaretto i have more of the amaretto leftover than i have the cream soda i'm pretty much almost done with this one it's delicious i'll get to that in a second then they're cbd vegan and gluten free gummies this comes with 30 gummies and there's 25 milligrams of cbd per serving and then lastly is their lemon up am disposable vape pen and they have a couple other flavors i saw on their website some are supposed to be more relaxing and have different effects depending on the essential oils that they use in the formula so for those of you who have never tried cbd products before cbd is the chemical compound found in cannabis but it is non-psychoactive so it's not the same as thc it's not going to get you high it's legal now pretty much everywhere and has been proven to have medical benefits so they are able to send these out without it being only strictly to a legalized state like here in colorado or california or any of the other states on the east coast that are but cbd really anybody can buy in america at least from my knowledge so cbd is one of those things that it really it does a lot of different things so it's anti-inflammatory it helps soothe it's relaxing calming supposed to help with pain due to its anti-inflammatory properties so i mean there's a lot of different things that it does hold on sure you guys have seen it popping up everywhere on social media in skin care food supplements it's everywhere now cbd is the hot thing along with adaptogens and a lot of other trends that are currently trending so i being a weed smoker as well so i use um marijuana products that contain thc and cbd thc being the psychoactive compound i guess i have a little bit of a warped expectation of what cbd is going to do versus someone who is going right off the bat and trying cbd for the first time and having no experience having no past experience with thc you don't get the same effect it's not going to necessarily alter your mood anyway it's going to more so do or benefit you over time so with the oil in particular the very first time that i use these literally nothing happened i didn't notice a change in my sleep or my mood but after i got through a little bit more almost a quarter through the bottle is when i started noticing when i was waking up i didn't have as much pain in my neck my dreams were a little bit weird and that is one of the things that can happen with these types of ingredients and not even marijuana derived ingredients like valerian root can give you weird dreams magnesium sometimes can as well skull cap extract can give you weird dreams there's just there's a lot of other things that can so it's not necessarily something you have to be wary about if you've ever taken a sleepy time herbal tea you might have experienced the same thing but that did happen with me i had some weird dreams in the beginning and as i adjusted and started incorporating into my daily routine i wasn't experiencing that anymore outside of the normal weirdness that my dreams normally are they're they're messed up um yes you get about 30 doses in here as well there's 250 milligrams of um cbd infused in the entire bottle and you are supposed to take one full dropper or hold it for 15 to 30 seconds sublingually which means under your tongue before swallowing and you do really want to make sure that you're doing this because the underside of our tongue is where we have a lot of blood receptors and a lot of the time for medicines especially in like film strip form you'll put under your tongue to dissolve orange cream is a favorite it's honestly delicious it tastes so good it's hard to do just one dropper full but there's no harm in doing more than one honestly i'll be i'll admit i've done probably three or four before when i really needed to knock out and me saying that doesn't mean it's gonna make you groggy and just zonk out you will not in any way be incapacitated it's just gonna kind of calm you get you a little bit less fast-paced brain that sounds like it's it's sedating it's not it's relaxing cherry amaretto i think they use the same cbd derivative for all of their products except for maybe the vape pens which might be a little bit different um but the cherry amaretto same effects doesn't really affect my dreams as much anymore the only thing is i just don't like cherries so there's a lot of this left so probably i don't know incorporate it into desserts or something i don't know if you are a cherry amaretto lover you should check this out second to last but certainly not least are the vegan gluten-free gummies these are really enjoyed so being a colorado resident i have the ability and honestly the luxury and privilege to go into a dispensary and pick out different types of gummies whether they be thc or cbd based or a hybrid of both this was an area that i'm pretty versed and familiar with and these honestly blew my mind considering the fact that they do not have any gelatin in them they are very very akin to sour patch kids in texture they they really you would not know that these are vegan nor would you know that they're not from a candy company they taste so good they're delicious and i think the delivery system of having it in a gummy and having a dissolve over time makes these a little bit more suitable for the day i like having one of these like right when i wake up just to calm me down get me ready for my day and get me in a better mood whereas the drops are very concentrated they're sublingual it absorbs like it absorbs interpolation very quickly so those you wouldn't necessarily want to take them in the morning i really like them the flavors are great so these are the flavors it's a green orange a dark red and there was a pink but i think i ate all of those and the flavors are raspberry strawberry mango and lemon lime so i've ate in all the raspberry last but certainly not like i said i think i said that about the last thing whatever is the hemp base cbd lemon up disposable vape pen so i had a really glowing review for all the other products this is kind of where it goes a little bit downhill for me is more so an ethical reason not necessarily the efficacy of the product it works well vaping delivers those chemicals to your brain very quickly into your bloodstream so it is a really effective way to just get your little pick me up and i love that this is a lemon scent and they designated it for morning use i've been using it at night and it's fine it's not like it's gonna have caffeine or nicotine it's going to make you like more hyper and not able to sleep so you totally can use this at the night in the night time if you prefer but the one thing i have an issue with is the packaging and the fact that this is disposable i would really appreciate a rechargeable battery and then cartridges that can be repurchased or even liquid that can refill those cartridges so it's a little bit less single use packaging is really cute i would i honestly totally would have been fine having it in a just standard cardboard unicorn without having the foam padding i do get it it is a really nice element it's very apple-esque for being a cbd and natural-based company that is vegan i really would have appreciated to see more eco-conscious packaging packaging it came in was quite equal kind of like there wasn't styrofoam peanuts or anything like that but this particular thing i just wish even better packaging and that these weren't single use and disposable once you're done with them because these are mixed material they have this kind of pseudo plastic paper uh wrapping around the component and from the vape pens i've owned from my other cartridges there's a heating element there's a different type of pipe that runs through the entire length of device for air intake and then there's another type of plastic for this another type of plastic for the led so you can't recycle these they just go to landfill and that's it but basically you just pull on it for a few seconds the little light will [Music] illuminate i got a couple um it's much easier to do that with a hookah and not these but anyway so let me just go over pricing really quick before i wrap up this video and give my final thought or the vape pens uh the lemon up was actually on sale from 25 to 18 it seemed to be the only one that was on sale the other ones remain at a 25 price point the orange and the amaretto cream uh cbd oils were 15 but again as i mentioned the amaretto is sold out currently but the orange cream is on sale for 13. and then the vegan gluten-free gummies which are a 30 count bottle are 35 currently on sale for 30. i unfortunately don't have an affiliate or discount code for you guys this is not a sponsored video they just asked me to try these products out so giving my honest review and again that's why i was a little bit negative about the packaging and whatnot i think the price point is great i really like the brand message i think cbd needs to be more widely explored by a lot of people it does help a lot of issues that you might otherwise have just been prescribed something for whereas this is a better and not addictive alternative but so yeah for my final thoughts i love cbd i think it's a great ingredient you guys should definitely try it out if you have not i love the line i think it's really effective they do a high quality source cbd you don't have that really very distinct plant taste after eating or using any of the product especially the vape and vape cbds have a very they're not as pleasant to inhale as a just normal thc pen so i appreciate that they were able to formulate it in such a way that makes it more pleasant experience for the customer my only downfall again is the packaging and then i didn't personally necessarily see there was a lot of adjectives i didn't necessarily see a huge difference in my mood for myself so a lot of the time people will use cbd for depression or anxiety and it didn't really help me without it it was more of a sleep aid for my um usage and that's actually okay so maybe that's not negative but yeah guys that concludes this video if you are interested in headbase please check them

you", "dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs calm and don't forget to subscribe to our G farmer TV YouTube channel", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me i'll keep making videos showing love to you you know what i'm saying thank you and i'll catch you on the next video here on true buds tv yeah this is true buzz that mary j now we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts

screaming i got five on it in the cut of sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is true buzz tv buzz i'm a stoner i'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "SLihlyzlkHE": "hey guys new cat discount vape pen and today we're gonna help you answer the question what is the best voltage for my cartridge [Music] alright guys so here we have two different kinds of batteries for you as well as two different kind of cartridges to kind of meet up a couple different scenarios and you could kind of just get a good idea for yourself what might be best for you to hit your cartridge at so I think the more important part of this is actually gonna be the batteries um so you can see here we have a spinner type battery and for those of you who aren't sure what that means is if you look here you have a little dial with varying numbers um so you can see start at 3.3 volts that's that's your power selection and you see what I did there how I could spin this little dial on the bottom you could increase the power up to different settings or come down so as you see I'm scrolling up to 3.8 this would be 3.9 ok 4 and so on so you could just keep increasing it decreasing it and go into different settings in between pretty much exactly what you want to do make it very customizable the alternative method would be a battery like this which doesn't at first look like it has any adjustments but what these are is gonna be a click style adjuster so we turn it on which is already on you can see that the color is green that's gonna signify a set voltage if we do three clicks just see the color flash and now that's an it's next setting so you have three three three presets of voltage increase all right so now just more - talking to that Oh like we just saw this guy is gonna have your three presets where you know you can scroll between three point four three point seven and four which is nice to be able to adjust but again with this spinner battery we can we can really change the dial and do the in-betweens of those settings so it's a whole lot more customizable and if you really want to pinpoint on exactly where you want to be this is gonna be your way to do it you know here you can see three point three and three point you know look that would be like consider to jump but here we can go in between I really do what we want if we want to settle it down or turn it up a little in between those presets of this guy that's what's great about the spinner batteries now how that's gonna affect your cartridges as you can see we have two different cards is here this is gonna be a ceramic type cartridge and you can see the heating element with with the way the wick holes are versus this guy which is gonna be one of your more old-school wick cartridges now the ceramic is gonna be able to take more power these are gonna be better at higher voltages the very low force is where you're gonna want to cap these out at so like you know four point two really should be the highest you're gonna consider going with these there are a few out there on the market that'll need more and at that point I would say just keep it at four point two and then if you feel like you need a bump turn it up just ever so slightly you know possibly with a spinner battery cuz that's gonna be your best way to do that and just come up and don't be afraid you know but also you know don't go too high can't start and then we have the alternative which would be your your cotton wick cartridges these guys aren't gonna be so good on keeping a higher power setting you're really gonna want to try to stick to around 3.6 3.7 3.8 I wouldn't I really wouldn't want most of these into the pores I have seen one or two in the past that have needed a little bit higher of a power setting but it's very rare so yeah just to kind of realize your bit your best way is gonna be keep it low see how it feels take a solid hit and then if you feel like you need a little more turn it up ever so slightly whichever way you may be doing that whether it's with your spinner battery which would be a little more I'm coming up in the small lengths or you can do it with your click button adjuster which that guy is gonna bring you to the next preset hopefully that next preset is gonna be in them after that close up hopefully you have a better idea of what the proper voltage to hit your 510 cartridge job would be um like we said it's really gonna depend more so on the battery um if you have one of the ones that has an adjustable adjustable slider on it like a spinner type battery it's better for finding exactly where you want to be because you'd go into the in-betweens that a 3 click wouldn't provide you so for example like we said this guy you click 3 times and it goes into one setting and the next setting in the next which is great because you can kind of take high medium low depending on what kind of cartridge you have but if you have a spinner battery it's really gonna allow you that freedom to go in between all those different sights you really find the perfect setting for your specific cartridge now the cartridge also does matter to like you know if you have ceramic which is going to be you know you can tell that it's ceramic if you look at it to see little Whipple's in the bottom that can be hit at a higher setting those are okay the low fours you know three point eight four four point two those are all going to be okay for most of the ceramic type cartridges if you have a conduit cartridge like this guy where you can see cotton exposed to through the center that's going to be on the lower head where you're at you know 3.6 3.8 maybe 3.9 again different company different cartridges by different companies they're gonna have the power requirements so there's a little bit of play play wiggle room on you kind of just figuring out based on what you have but either way these batteries will also provide you with the perfect hit depending on you know what setting you want to keep it at that's the partisan brand other than that I mean you just kind of use a little bit of common sense - depending on if they hit feels like it's enough you know that that's it you don't need to go any higher try to keep it as low as you can know what that being said that should really give you all the employee to know about that if you like

it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good [Music] alright guys back here for no [ __ ] video we out here got the bong ready to go your honor you know it is but today guys there's gonna be a short little vlog a little informative bug about fake [ __ ] carts guys because there's been a lot of fake ass carts going around and I don't want you guys to get cheated you feel me I want you guys to I want you guys to be able to smoke realize cars guys like I'm tired of people selling fake ass cars and it's just disrespectful guys so like today I found a guy who sells fake for all garden carts and I have a real raw garden this is a real rug or in the place that I got it from is verified I'll probably show you guys later that is verified just to prove you guys that it's [ __ ] verified and I don't know we don't get these fake cards off the street now we can't get the fake cars off the street but I can tell you guys how to tell the difference between a fake and a real [Music] as people have been selling fake cards for too long guys it started off with the brass knuckles and the dang cars and the mario cards like wind-up mario nigut if you smoke something called mario [ __ ] you stupid but um I hit him up this dumb just so dude that sells like treating cars on the street I hit him love and he's gonna come through real quick and when he gets here I'm going to show you guys what the [ __ ] the difference is but before that let me take a bong rip you guys already freaking know you know I'd be on my bong way of life all right I'm gonna get back to you guys in a few minutes I'm just waiting for him to pull up and we all will get these things all right before I um talk to him real quick he's about to come in in a few minutes I just want to show you that I got it from a place that's verified if it has the check mark and we maps that shit's verify so all these are verified and the one that I bought the other day I did a vlog on it you guys want to check it out with the link in the description it is a chocolate slurm alright guys I'm finally back and this is how you could tell the fake from the real pro so I got the dojo Kush I actually spend money on it and then I got the cherry slurm I couldn't find the chocolates learn that I had but I had cherries learn before and I know it's verified so I got that this is the rowan and this is the fake the first difference I'm gonna show you guys is you know the difference in the boxes the boxes are totally different I looked at that [ __ ] I knew was fake but I needed a box to get it so I said [ __ ] it take one for team but check yourself so this is Rowan and this is fake as you can see the font and the color are totally different see the fake one is more light green light green around while the real one is dark green start reading around and you can see the font is different too by the net weight and cartridge you can see that the font are way different see by the fonts on the date and of the other other information on here that's how you can see that's the first way you guys can tell a fake from a real so the other way is by actually looking at the cart actually I have to open it real quick give me a second guys so now the second difference is there's no see a caution on the card up see how the real one this is the real one you see how the real one has the CA on it that one didn't have it and then you can also tell by the color that's the third thing you could do is hell is by the color but honestly the color on these look super similar so I don't know but usually you can tell by the color guys and then you guys already know the last way is to like actually taste test the product but I already know it's fake but for you guys I'm gonna do it for the one time for you guys the wu-tang alright guys do not I'm just gonna tell you guys do not buy [ __ ] carts off the street like I already knew it was kind of bad when he told me that the cart was $45 that's a that's a signal that's a signal all in itself right there $45 boy that [ __ ] is 65 but I was just going with it I'm not I don't care I just needed a car either way you feel me but um it's 65 guys or more for these cars they're expensive and that's why they taste so good this [ __ ] tastes like a [ __ ] battery guys like it doesn't taste good at all it has no type of essence from the flower nothing like it might look similar this [ __ ] really gave me one with a fat bubble engine bro I just got screwed but um it's fake guys like I don't know let me taste this one [Music] see I wish you guys could taste this so you guys could tell this is that real raw garden [ __ ] like [ __ ] this fake [ __ ] but like those are the ways that you guys can tell guys I hope everyone's having a good day I just wanted to do a short little vlog for you guys because I just wanted to post more so I just decided to do something about karts because I don't know I feel like not too many people are doing the karts are they're not showing you the real fake ones like that are actually out there so I bought one I was like man let me show you guys like what the real fake ones look like let me just show you guys so I got one and I'm probably gonna throw it in the trash matter of fact just take this [ __ ] this is what you do with fake cards you take the fake cart and guys okay go to the trash can and you see the cigarette butts you throw it in with the cigarette butts so I hope everyone liked this vlog don't forget to Like comment subscribe and don't [ __ ] smoke fake cards make sure you go to a dispensary or get you got to get it from some reputable place make sure they're verified it's not worth your health you know what I mean so just get a verified one pretty much all you have to do is not buy off the street

sleep last week and i mean i was just up all night i just i was just watching youtube videos i just couldn't fall asleep i was struggling uh it was probably like one o'clock in the morning so i was like let me go on my little cbd stash and go ahead and test it out i didn't have a lighter on me at the time and i was in bed i just didn't feel like you know what i'm saying trying to find a lighter going outside and you know what i'm saying i just didn't feel like doing all of that so i went up in my little sample box they sent me and i pulled this out and i hit this about four or five good times and after that i just know birds were chirping and it was daytime all right like trust me just just try it out now this disposable vape by itself is 29.99 or you're an avid you know i'm saying

you are new to my channel go ahead and subscribe drop a like and i'll see you guys in the next video", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you want to see more videos like this subscribe and hit the like and you will see more videos

[ __ ] is this [Music] yo yo yo what's up guys this is nugget fresh and California clouds this is stoner shenanigans and today working parents and pens let's get before we begin we just wanted to let you know that all products have been purchased lately from mankind dispensary to ensure authenticity alright guys we are back we got five you fate pens from five new companies if you haven't yet seen it check out our previous video where we compare five eighths from the top brands in California so what are you most excited about well today well actually if you guys watch any of our past videos you guys know I'm all about the canvas terms so today I'm really excited to try something new something I never tried guys and that is this guy right here this is some friendly farms guys I have never tried actual live resin full-spectrum live rather than in a pen this is no discipline this is just 100% live residents tucked in this pen that you don't add any extra turkeys with nothing guys nothing so this is going to be I think 68 percent THC yes it does you know it is somewhat low but you guys remember it's not his lip this has a full spectrum high so you know this high is gonna feel and be a lot different than any high you're gonna get a pen so waiting but I'm really excited just the first time I've heard of a pen this way I've always heard where you get your distillate you add your terpenes and then maybe once in a while other companies toss them the other things might be talking about that later but I'm just excited to be honest I'm a little curious about how it's gonna taste since they didn't have the trick things back in there but nevertheless let's get to it yeah that's good to it alright get over it I'm gonna try so as you know all these to be pens are supposed to be childproof tamper proof people true that sticker on it with a sticker Sarah oh yeah guys so we're trying this trade but its flavor I guess you could say it's called Chewbacca Chewbacca sure I don't know you guys can you guys can you put up that heavy suit you guys think it is but it's a hybrid and it's looking pretty good honestly oh also what is special about this mean this is a collab right with easioyya these farm stuff I think it's gonna be cool out stuff I do have stuff that the feds just took the straight line that's just from other farms and stuff like that so yeah we'll take a look at this one right now you know and I will plug you know close to three guys as always suggest and see how dark this stuff is and when I say dark I don't mean like bad door can I just mean it's big it's not it's not desolate rise it in take all you know the camp going turkey new tripping out of there and take all the bats what is and you know this is it guys this is your lever isn't just straight stuff doing then I am so excited right now of course we got our battery from the court officials perfect for this a 5-10 thread leaves ok so just making sure okay so we're at three point four guys and I think I'm gonna keep it back to repent for usually I'll go to point eight but since this is not dis lit and this does have like you know more of that's enough plant matter in it I I do want to burn out a higher temperature so if it doesn't taste like you know all that goes up into a point in yeah [Music] I've also heard before people say that they always wanted on a lower battery setting or so you can might taste the turkeys better and so this doesn't have champions that definitely makes sense yes yeah yeah yeah I like that it is so totally different at the lane that like that taste is like so natural wax doesn't say it smells kind of like the smell of like a for your job or like a bird but yeah that's awesome awesome awesome I could smoke on that all day long that's like up there with raw cardoons flavor honestly even though Gardens like almost taste like something that's not quite hitting that that's you know 100% locked and add flavor but it's the closest thing in the market right now and tell me right now until right now alright I don't think this you know actually does take precedence in flavors over anything I've ever tasted I mean it makes sense it's not you're not tampering yeah yeah it does remind me a little bit broader is I will say that I like the Terps yeah the terms relate to motors in this rail there no no no Rihanna trips because there's Turks nothing oh okay I'm sorry that's my bad it's just it that's crazy that's that's nuts so I'm going away so I don't know if you were to write this you know oh yeah one to tattoo the same all right guys so late personally I'm a bit I need to see you know raiding stuff like that just like total enjoyability and smoke and like just the way it made me feel the way that hey like actually went in like when I held it I guess it's like maybe it's just the distillate you know that like makes my nose like I like her a little bit like you feel it is - no not at all not one bit so I said that I'd be like perfect Penn High like I just feel like you should he give something in 10 just because looks like a hundred percent the best of the best but like I'll give it a nine point seven I mean like the flavor is ridiculous hi I will take that anger or anything else stick back flavor is just not late and then also you know feel like you know years old again you know or closest to a nice know or something you know I don't like that straight in your face I you think when you think of full spectrum highlight what do you think of like that body high like where it's like you for it and it washes over you or like I feel yeah it's more relaxing it's more calming it's more like a wave you know what I'm saying it's more of like it's you and then like a colic you ride it out you know what I'm saying whereas those wax and I feel like can you smoke it you know what I'm saying and then you get high for about 30 45 minutes and it really okay and then like you just boom I don't know yes there I just feel like you just you know you'll have a lot more enjoyable time with that miswak and I'm excited to take a date and literally just smoke this and just see how I feel like we actually got this from place box and then you were nice enough to include a DAB cap so make sure you guys check them out this dab cap will literally turn like almost any one of your vape pens like into a hittable like okay well actually we have figured that some bakers are more are better than others of lechery actually look at the tip of this this is let's hit similar to the tip that rock artists on it these tips will go really well fit the nasty sound so why not getting show [Music] [Music] so I just need to have my wits about me or I'm not gonna do this video so all right so no I think it's your turn to pick I know you're coughing dying right now just point and we got it for you I'm really excited to try this one I definitely can't wait to hear her opinions but yeah I think sighs this to me is just like you know on time coming I just I've heard a lot about them but I've never actually sat down and over the package of platinum bait and I just looking so you know it's a great price point fifty dollars for one gram that's [Music] that's pretty good a and honestly is right now I got from the farm sixty two dollars at for a half is a half way like I just said this my number one pen right now it's just beats it I'll be hard-pressed okay let me see if I can always struggle with the fast ones I do like the design those boxes no chopper just tells me I just taped over the chocolate you know and then [Applause] yeah they still put the they said with a little less of things on the I like that I especially like the talk please like if I put my all right I want to see you take the fattest rib out of that piece all right now see what flavor do we got white buffalo interesting have you ever heard it's gonna say I really like this packaging because there's the state of California in it I think that's pretty California and all right what do you think flavor-wise white buffalo I don't know what it tastes like but like like like a peach orange a little harsh which is crazy because you would think that yellow slime present would be streaming I get news okay you got this all right real quick rating Platinum v what do you think all right well as you guys can see it's it was a little harsh definitely $50 you know it's still it's great you know already but I don't know the flavor was definitely like reminiscing yeah of orange and if you had a baby I don't know if a white buffalo taste like that I wouldn't imagine but you know so I can't really speak on like what the flavor like you resembles but like did taste it yet he's good but it didn't taste like so so so yeah so yeah so these guys I'm actually kind of excited to try these guys kids these trying to think that via song they have you know cannabis terpenes cannabis oil you know Italy Italy also had some secret ball taxes yeah with like like a turkey I think yeah this is definitely a weird design guys and just like look at this right now there's like a little like swirl in the center of it which is kind of weird I beautiful is that and then there's also you know I mean this thing it's just one of the ones like right like the other side look at the comparison I'm already like really big so yeah okay sorry just be like all right all right enough talk about it this is Bubba a ping guys she's a bad beginning but I know sorry I'm okay go for it I'll tell you what everyone what I think it's definitely interesting when they see like floor equipment and cool I do get that little like maybe perfumey taste just a little bit and remind me a little bit of cheesy just a little bit like the taste so it's just I don't know go back and is business sweet if this is the kind of speech it's like really light though like it makes a good vapor it seems like you know you're like you're like there's like oh my god there's like an insane amount of like space like in this closed like it's closing [Music] it's not like I can't is maybe I'm just like I don't know I know it's just it's just not my favorite like this one TC if I don't be it and video tasted a little bit better later not like a little bit better definitely a lot bit better I think than that one but I'm still loving the friendly friends right now okay so well I I don't like everything I don't like a sugary taste too much so like that was like a light that's almost like a lemon is just a tight yeah really right so I was gonna do one but personally I wanted to be that wasn't taste in the campus but you have this week I believe this I can think [Music] like I love candy and so I think that's why I like containing our yeah that's that's why okay what we stopped to mourn we still got some competitors here you guys alright what's up next I don't I think I'm excited I kind of let me say about this one absolute extracts it's called dawn water oh gee so definitely wanted to try that when we saw it early yes like this is interesting okay and also if it's you art so I'm pretty excited about that yeah let's do it this is very interesting very cool that Conner Lake looks like like the top that you put on the pill bottle yeah I like it it's like yeah alright let's get into this push [Music] and so this is kind of cool right that we have Moxie tart and this is like straight-up kbx but it's for the dart system so it can just go into the dark absolutely we're told so since they even if you're taking an open eye they probably can't get there they do okay evaluate what they were doing eat you've had this very well here baby I don't even know why I'm Cheers [Music] oh yeah guys um but yeah I know that definitely tasted pretty good I kind of like want to just like puff on that a few times to like see how high that gets me exactly like it would get me like really live yeah it was interesting like you said though like definitely like painters thing it was like to me it tasted more of like - it's like that or - or something like it was good I liked it no like teeny like I feel like they didn't like a look at much of chirps in there anything like yeah yeah I think I'm probably had an eight with that one okay yeah I'm nerdy Nate - it's like eight like seven point five eight like yeah Joey it's just like the way the battery hit so like to meet I like fat hits I guess by the way is some healing effects like like doing if I could hit this three times I do it and just wing it didn't spark up that much and so I don't know me hey yeah okay yeah I think I'm at like seven point five I think like it's definitely like up there with your friendly farms oh yeah yeah yeah I know I won't lie it's good yeah yeah all right doesn't want you favorite so far I think yeah all right we got one left Alpine I just see these people on Instagram I've definitely been really curious I don't think it's chemistry so I'm still down I'm still excited

the cart carl go ahead and come in and take a look fx really has quality stuff um it's one of the reasons we really like them so let's uh take this first spin and see how this actually tastes and i'm never really disappointed with an fx delta a cartridge they've done a really good job with the terpenes and the terpenes are basically the component inside the product that gives it the taste as far as the granddaddy perp goes this is an indica strain really kind of perfect when you're just kind of hanging out and you're wanting to chill and relax and maybe even go to sleep as opposed to kind of being out and about and active and doing stuff so it's definitely a little bit heavier so as far as price goes for this cartridge uh right now on leafdrop.co you can pick these up for 39.99 if you are

and you get the pen and i really do love the packaging i'm not gonna lie this is just this this is great packaging this is the 0.5 milliliter and it is the kit so that's what you need to make sure you get if you go to them if you don't already have a pen which i did not so i had to order the kit but let's get to it man because delta 8 is all the rave right now so they say um this makes the review

self love is the best love so look if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please get to the closest of me and tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself you dig so let's see what it's talking about and yeah smoking in the hotel room [ __ ] the rules that banana flavor is delicious oh my god it's yummy yummy yummy some kind of song that banana is good this is definitely justin bieber this is definitely bieber in here black tie you got that yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yup set up work i'm gonna wait yeah babe okay okay okay this is about the delta egg first of all oh man i said banana i meant banana that banana flavor is kicking i can tell you this it does not take much it don't take much to fix their fix the effects kick in quick so um i would talk more about the banana flavor but if you don't know what a banana tastes like then where have you been but the flavor banana bananas amazing i love banana i like banana flavored nyls i just like that flavor so this was an excellent excellent choice for moi that's me [ __ ] smooth but yet strong though it is strong and the effects the effects are great it is a as the effects kick in it reminds you of a delta nine thc type feel if you're familiar with what i'm talking about um it it feels like it's close to that it's not that though this is definitely uh it's it's delicious the effects are the effects are calming uh that's my homeboy uh vic right there the effects are calming um it is a it's a you you you almost you're right there at getting an intoxicated type feel but really really good um i will say this excuse me i will say this if you guys are used to one if you do not fool with thc because it increases your anxiety rather than helps calm it down then be careful with this because it's gonna somewhat remind you of that type of feel um but if you guys are not worried about that at all then this is definitely a must-have uh and i'm just indulging right now because it really doesn't take that much for the effects to start kicking in but at the same time the the flavor makes you want to keep hitting it the flavor alone will make you just keep coming back more coming back for more but the effects kick in really quick and it it it's a it's a it's a sense of it's a sense of euphoria uh it gives you a happy feel i definitely feel like this is a uh like it's a i don't know if delta 8 is a sativa but it gives you a sativa type of feel dude this is good i'm impressed i'm impressed with this a lot man this will be with me everywhere i go everywhere i go to the mall to the gas station to the stove everywhere i go this is gonna be my this is teddy ruxman this is gonna be my buddy and everywhere i go he's gonna go my buddy this is going to be my buddy oh i'm blown away it's amazing it's euphoric it's awesome it's wonderful it's great i'm gonna run out of adjectives before i run out before i run out of good things to say about it uh oh man black tie for the win black tie for the win man uh i love this company the the the customer service is amazing shipping is super super quick and this oh and this is cb this is not just delta 8 by itself this is cbd and delta 8 together which it so you get you get the calming effects from the cbd right but then you get that boost of delta

a salute hey delta for the win", "qnJnuDTWlms": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day", "i0JoUlqsJ9M": "hey y'all trevor here with red relief and today we're going to be diving into our 510 vape cartridge this week we're gonna be diving into the tangy kush from good supply i've had this one set aside for quite a while i thought it was finally time to actually dig into it and try it out i'm looking forward to it i hope you guys are as well but for the time being we're gonna go ahead and slide on into the intro before we get into this cartridge you guys i'll see you on the other side when we're gonna get into the info then we're gonna start smoking our way through it cheers i'll see on the other side [Music] hey guys and welcome back so as i said in the intro we are going to be diving into the tangy kush 510 vape cartridge from good supply so these guys came out with a thc total on this cartridge of 79.4 percent we've got a cbd total of 0.7 percent and a package date of july 20th 2020 and a price of 35.99 so all in all this cartridge has got a lot to offer for that price point the 35.99 is great to see especially when we're getting into these half grammers because that's that's a more reasonable entry point for these cartridges and they definitely seem to be the good supply the hexo the retican anything at that price point definitely seems to be moving a lot of so will be very interesting to see how this one does because i haven't tried it yet so on the ontario cannabis store website which is the only place i was able to find the full details in one place we're going to rattle off the information for this cartridge before we dive into it you guys so get down with the citrus tangy kush has arrived in potent distillate form and is a hundred percent plant-based you'll know what they mean when they say tangerine good vapes from good supply so the licensed producer is a fria or good supply it's a very strong potency the thc range is going to be the 77 to 83 percent the cbd is going to range right around that zero percent it is sativa dominant it's a co2 extraction process and your top terpenes are going to be alpha penine beta meristenine beta pinene and linolol so i'm quite curious to see how this is going to taste and see if we get that really citrusy orange tangerine flavor that the tangy kush name and the description has for us you guys but we're going to go ahead and get our urban scale intro in here before we uh dive in with the uber battery first and then we go into our g pen before we finish it through the glass and then we'll talk about the high and give it an overall out of 40 you guys so let's break this seal and get into this cartridge and see how good supply did with this tangy cushy guys i'll see on the other side of the urban scale because we've got that open [Music] welcome back you guys so let's go ahead and get this cartridge out and let's take our first looks at it so overall i do really like the good supply cartridges one thing is the thc sticker comes off really easy and as well they do have a very nice basic look to them as well as well so you used to go to the other side well-branded so you've got the good buds wrap right there and then you've got the tangy kush in the green so it keeps you well well informed on what you're exactly smoking on so let's get that thc sticker up on there and uh we're gonna go ahead and start out with the uber battery the way we do our battery tests is we run through all three of the temperatures or voltages that are available on these batteries so for the vuber we go green blue red for the g pen we go blue green red and then after that we do the exact same thing but we run it through our rigs so the mad hatter and the vuber battery go together our 420 and our g pen battery go together and we do all of that using our hemper adapter right here so now that you guys kind of know what to expect while we're diving into this we're gonna just go ahead and dive into this i'm gonna take my first haul with the good supply tang kush cartridge to see how the initial flavor and effects are going to be before we crank it up and we start rattling this review off for you guys so enough talking we're almost five minutes into this let's go ahead and try this cartridge and see how it does choose you guys and i'll see you on the other side [Music] okay so hint of an orange very much a hint of an orange now there's kind of a floral licorice combo on the afterwards like it's it's almost more of like an uh and a set like that kind of not a raw black licorice not that harsh licorice flavor that you can sometimes sometimes find this definitely doesn't have that it's that really watery orange a tangeriney orange flavor with a little bit of that licorice undertone which is interesting you guys not something i expected but it's interesting so we're gonna go ahead and take our second haul with the second temp and see how it does through there and i'm curious to see if it goes more the citrus route or more of this kind of gummied candied wine gum almost kind of experience you guys so it sticks with that light tan it's it's very much more of that wine gum style experience you guys where while you're chewing on the candy you're getting that sweet kind of fruity flavor but at the same time there's just there's something there that is taking your attention off of it and it's making you look for another type of flavor which personally i don't mind like i i don't mind a thinking a thinking man's kind of smoke where you have to really figure out what you're tasting i don't mind that at all when it comes to the cartridges i wish it was a little bit more intense for the overall flavor like i wish both flavors were just more more oomph there a little bit more carry to it but all in all i'm not that disappointed and i'm still enjoying this cart so far you guys now we're going to crank it up to the highest temp we've got it set on the red setting let's go ahead and take our first hauls at this level before we move on into the g pen and try it there you guys but for now the tangy kush isn't doing bad it's enjoyable but it's not overwhelming okay so that had the strongest overall flavor like as i was saying this needs to just increase get a little bit more um potent just a little bit stronger flavor that's what happened when we bumped up to that highest temp so i'm curious if it's an airflow thing or a temperature based issue for the flavor because that one i see i don't know why but i always haul harder and faster through the higher temperatures where the lower ones i like to sip and kind of paste on where with this uh this cartridge moving over to the g pen we're gonna have larger ports so it's naturally gonna have more airflow so i'm curious if that's gonna allow us to get a sweeter more rich flavor because the comparison of the two batteries is really part of the reason why i do the reviews the way i do it just because i want to really see where the cart does best and i want to show you guys where the cart does best so through the uber battery i'm gonna give it a six because i wouldn't say it was enjoyable it didn't have enough overwhelming and uplifting and really powerful flavors or experience to get me go oh [ __ ] yeah that's an eight that's like it's really really up uplifting enjoyable exciting seven or eight i can't i just it's not quite there five or six it's got kind of that plus it's got that little umph to it that's enjoyable but nothing overwhelming or nothing that really is um or nothing that really makes me go [Music] over the moon with excitement it's just kind of it's there now moving into the g pen we've got the lowest temp set up let's see how it does through here before we go back into the vooper battery and run it through the glass and then we go through and do it with the g pen all over again you guys we still have lots of smoking left but first and foremost let's get through this cheeto okay so tangerine flavor a little bit on the lighter side in this one we definitely get more of that anise that licorice more floral kind of push it's got more of that wine sign to the wine gums which personally i'm enjoying i would rather a strong tangerine flavor and i would really prefer that kind of sweet juicy experience but this is nice it's just not top of the list nice it's enjoyable but forgetful that that's really the experience of having with this cartridge so far you guys now we're gonna move up to the second temperature see how it does through there and then wrap it up with the highest attempt so let's see what mid-range does for us [Music] okay so i got surprisingly more orange on that one but it didn't change the overall flavoring that i was getting like the balance leaned a little bit more to the orange side but it didn't hold that orange tangerine that citrus flavor that i'm getting does not hold it hits and it passes and then we get that floral that licorice that wine version of the wine gum flavor you guys that is enjoyable i will say that i am enjoying it quite a bit now i would prefer the orange and the citrus flavor if i'm being 100 honestly guys and why not when we're doing these reviews be 100 honest so that's what i'm looking for is just more orange flavor for me to enjoy but for the time being you guys we're going to go ahead and finish up our just cartridge reviews before we dive into the glass and then we talk about the high so see how it does in the highest temperature you guys cheers okay so let's quickly switch that temperature back on over to the lowest so we do not forget to do that when we uh take our ribs through the rigs but the g pen i'm not i'm honestly i'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 as well it was a smoother draw smoother experience overall i will give it that now saying that it didn't have as much of that citrus flavor and citrus push that the uber battery did the uber had the better flavor the g-pad had the better smoking experience but neither of them were over the moon exciting really overly enjoyable it was very much i'm smoking this to get high not necessarily to enjoy the flavor when i'm comparing it and that this is the biggest thing you guys when i'm saying anything like this this is in comparison to the best cartridge i've smoked so far or the better cartridges i've smoked so far a lot of the anytime i'm doing that i uh well i'm using it's always in comparison to the stuff that i've really enjoyed because that i'll smoke for flavor like the orange cookies there's there's certain strains and certain cartridges that i will smoke purely for flavor because that enjoyment is the enjoyment i absolutely love the flavor is what sells me that strain now there are another category of strains and vapes and concentrates that are they [ __ ] me up they just get me high and that's a totally separate purpose for i'm enjoying the flavor i'm enjoying the flavor is i'm sitting at home i don't have anything planned i'm gonna get baked out in my mind so i'm just gonna smoke what i like to smoke this gets behind okay these strains have a specific purpose they help me this way i don't necessarily enjoy the flavor as much but i need this effect or i need this type of high or i need to i'm going to do this so i need like it's that give to take kind of companionship and this cartridge i'm finding is leaning more to that enjoyment than the actual enjoying the taste of the cartridge but until we run them through these rigs you never know because we could run it through some water and it could just blow me away and then at that point it'll become one of those pre-loaded bong kind of cartridges like i've got a purpose for everything i smoke i find a way to enjoy it the best that i can so enough talking you guys i i i get on these little rambles and then you guys get to enjoy a couple of minutes of me just going off but enough enough of that it's time to get back into the review and why you guys are here and that's going to be taking this tang and kush cartridge for some more rips let's start it out with our vuber battery and the mad hatter glass rig the way we do this is we start with the lowest temperature we go to the second highest and then after that we preheat and we grip at the highest temperature before we move on over and do it again with the g pen and the other glass rig and then we'll give you a total out of the six rips for out of the glass you guys but for the time being let's get into it cheers okay first strip wasn't bad it's definitely going to be a licorice and out of scent kind of exp and a set kind of experience through this you guys so let's get through those first couple hauls done and they're not bad they're not bad at all they've got a decent flavor very much that ascent experience but we're preheating the cartridge right now we're going to take a rip on the highest 10. see how it does here choose you guys okay guys so uber battery through the glass licorice honestly that is the most accurate and most realistic um flavor that i can give you for what i got through there there was the really light kind of citric like that acidic burn that you get from oranges tangerines that that kind of sweet acid that you get there that citric experience i was getting that 100 i was getting that in there but that was just kind of the primary burn at the back of my throat and then it would go straight into this licorice and a set kind of experience that all in all you guys isn't that bad i actually enjoyed it quite a bit but but we um definitely definitely could have a better experience and a better flavor if we were to get more of that tangy that orange citrusy kind of experience you guys but all in all cartridge did quite well and a lot better than i was expecting but for the time being we're going to go ahead and take our ribs with the g pen through our 420 rig guys and see how it does in here because i'm quite curious to see if our g pen is going to be the savior and really give us this uh tangerine tangy kush or if we're going to keep playing in the licorice fields but for the time being let's go ahead and dive into this i'll see you guys when we're working our way through it cheers second rip y'all cheers [Music] last trip preheat let's see guys cheers [Music] okay guys so the glass is gonna end up getting a 5 out of 10. honestly oh little stutter on that one but honestly the cartridge i think this cartridge again supports kind of that theory that i'm having where it just if you don't give it the time to cool down and really bring in the new oil and really start to recover from each haul you're you're gonna lose terps and you're gonna lose flavor because after that first first hit i didn't get anywhere near the type of orange flavor and i just transitioned into more and more and more licorice and asset kind of an experience which personally i don't mind but if that's what you're pushing for the flavor and that's what i'm expecting getting into it i'll enjoy it a lot more than if you go well it's kind of a tangerine flavor my excitement and my and especially when it comes to sativas i don't like the licorice flavor for stevias i really don't sativas i want citrus i want fruity i want sugary sweet really sweet flavors or give me my cushes like that kind of swamp ass kush if it's got that benefit i love that kush flavor so i'm willing to smoke that day or night now the citrus flavors i didn't really smoke those day or night but i know those typically lean more towards the sativa side so i love starting my day off with a nice big bowl of orange juice mimosa like citrus it's my thing but this one wasn't quite when uh when we switched over to the g pen it honestly got worse for that licorice flavor got more intense it got definitely a lot more um it's a best word for it the best way to explain it is the balance changed quite heavily from having a hint of the orange to just not really be in there and it was actually quite disappointing once it got to that level you guys and i i i just wish i really do wish that there was more of a citrus tangerine push through this now moving on to the high the high is going to be where it does its best with the seven out of ten it's right on that enjoyable portion it's not really a [ __ ] you up kind of a vape it is definitely one of those you're getting stuff done but you just need that relief you need to have that like for me it just gives me that ease and the ability to take the half a second think about what's going on and then react like for any of the anxiety stress anything along there there's just that that reliefs that you're not wound up you're not a a spring just press ready to [ __ ] break or just snap out and just explode right it's just it gives you that very much ease and relaxing and gives you a little bit of an uplifting and encouraging effect but not not enough for me to really notice it um there is a touch of the mental drift but it's relatively easy to work through and it passes in five or ten minutes so it's more of just that that rush that really high rush high you get a little bit of that mental drift and then it passes relatively quickly but all in all you guys this vape card was enjoyable it just didn't have the flavors that i really want with my vapes being more my desserts of smoking i'm a lot harder when it comes to when you say you're going to be tasting like orange i'm going to expect you to taste a little bit more like gourds than uh than i do with my bud but overall you guys not bad definitely would recommend if you like more of that licorice orange combo that that kind of tiger ice cream almost experience which personally not minding just not my favor especially today but overall out of 24 out of 40 pretty good score it did not too bad honestly it didn't do too bad you guys it's just it's one of those ones where it's 36 bucks before tax it gets the job done it's decent and the thc range on it is actually quite nice and if you don't mind the flavors or if you're not that worried about the flavors it's definitely a cartridge worth picking up because you definitely get your value in the high um but we're gonna we're gonna wrap this one up you guys that that's gonna be it for today and the tangy kush bait from good supply didn't do too bad with a six out of ten out of the boober the six out of ten out of the g pen five out of ten on the glass a seven for the high for the total of 24 out of 40. can't complain too much we got baked this morning and you guys get to enjoy it as well but for the time being we're gonna wrap this one up my end card will slide in here you guys all you have to do

y'all and i will be back later with some more content", "oHcEXX-MHiw": "hey guys so I got a new vape pen today from cure vape here's my old one this is a pure one I originally got this because I was smoking out of these ceramic cartridges know if you can see that but it's on all the pure one ceramic cartridges they all say they strongly suggest using the pure one battery which is this one so that's what I got but pure has a full line of strains in these regular cartridges which are not ceramic they use the I believe I want to say fiberglass string it's like the old-school style I kind of like these better I feel like they last longer although the flavor is not as good and you don't really want fiberglass things in there forever that's a super bad for your body but as long as it none of it actually goes into your lungs you'll be fine but I got this so I could try out all their different flavors and I like the idea of having two pens anyway I can have one indica one sativa or whatever so I can smoke on them at different times so yeah so that's why I got this I also really like the boxes on these they're really soft they have like a slight rubberized coating to them they feel really nice I feel like it makes the brands like stand out a little better makes it seem like it's good quality stuff so we're gonna check this out okay it is comes the charger and that is all no instructions or anything but it's pretty straightforward just plug this into you know phone base and charge it this charger is different than the one charger as you can see this is the one for the pure one kind of sticks out we'll see they both seem about the same I mean well wise this is kind of cool actually just noticed that this is a stylus at the end of the small one so there's small vape pens have a little stylus at the end I'm still kind of wondering why they call it their small pen considering it's about the same size as this it might be a little skinnier but it's longer so I feel like they're the same size it's kind of hoping this would be a little smaller but it is not bad yeah let's go ahead and see if this is a charge in it so this cartridge that I got for this new pen is Green crack which I've been wanting to try and they do not sell them in the ceramic cartridges so I'm gonna see as you can see it lights up down there instead of the bottom it's cool it's charged right out of the box I feel like it hits really good I like this a lot I feel like the airflow is even better than this one it's really easily and this green crack tastes kind of like bananas to me like actual banana flavored it's kind of cool I don't think it's yeah it's not flavored it definitely tastes like banana to me and it's really good I'm just really excited about having two pans now and get started on this check back again later for some more reviews more unboxings more weed stuff and see you next time", "XngLtlXh0bg": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy

shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or medical marijuana my personal information alright yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so this video I got another car review for you guys I'm gonna be reviewing the same brand that I didn't like that the last to court review videos I think if you've seen him on Excel labs promo colors they just had a fire a steel so I picked up like I think six it yeah I picked up six cards in total so I still have two more flavors left of those to review so two flames I have left are tropical fruit and blueberry so I think in this video I'm gonna be smokin on the blueberry if you guys want to see a movie one in the tropical food and we're down below in the comments and I'll get that out yeah blueberry in this video so I'm not gonna spend I'm not gonna spend too much time going over a pathogen in this video I'll show you guys it a little bit better you guys want to see the packet more in like that detail go check out like I think it's my first or a second review on this company cuz I wanted like really in-depth detail on the packaging I'll give you a quick little look at it you'll break so the front evil labs blueberry contains cannabis so obviously um tested at 80% if you don't know how to use it it gives you instructions so and yeah so that's pretty much the package it's a half gram car the thing that I really like about these two um they're really really cheap I got doc they havethey oh I'm six cards you get six half gram cards and you get a battery like this battery right here eat more labs battery for sixty bucks so three cards and a battery for sixty bucks um I don't know if that's like ideal what they have like everywhere but at least that dispensary that I go to let the deal they have right now so oh yes I'm gonna take that off the battery so yeah this is battery right here this was just a regular stick battery evil laughs not I mean but uh it has them three different temperature settings low medium hot then it has a that preheating setting option where you gonna preheat your portal before you hit it to get like a full hit and yeah so I mean this it's pretty dope battery I mean you get it I'll be used for like the deal they have three cards and a battery for 60 bucks like 1500 milligrams that I mean like smoke shops usually sell these for like what 10 15 bucks so like I don't know how that's just like a fire SEO in my opinion let's just hop into this review with something aside this open this is something that I really like about this company really cheap it's like I was saying and they have all you small little details that are like fire like like I know this doesn't really like mean too much it's the quality of the oil that really matters the most but I I don't know I just always cool to have like some dope packaging make you know I mean so when you take a better uh yeah some once you slide it out it has this little part inside of that that has a evil labs this little white um container what do you call this so you open this up and the cards in here like I said to call the chroma colors yeah right chroma colors did I say that right I don't know but so every every every flavor comes with like a different color you've seen how this one is red so it has like a red tip blueberries blue I think this was sweet melon so that sweet melon was like a green that's just like another small little detail that they do that I think is like really really cool for especially at the price point that like I've been saying like they're so cheap and like it's all all those smaller details they do are like so dope and something else I forgot to mention it's actually a CEO to vaporize cartridge so yeah yeah blueberry cart here's little club close up of the oil said where's the public s so the bubbles right there this oil was like really really really big yes I'm down below in the comments what you guys think about the at least that looks to the oil I think it looks [ __ ] fire especially for being so cheap like I said uh you get three of these cards for 60 bucks with a battery like you really can't beat that the old my opinion and it's coming from the dispensary you're not getting it off the street so you know it's not like some fake [ __ ] like there's Mario karts or exotic you know it's not so [ __ ] like that it's actually from that's that's from like the dispensary so it like it has to be like umm Sayyaf II know what I'm saying so so yeah so just pop these a little blue blue little caps off of here we got the card screwed on to the battery I also really love like the aesthetic like the way this [ __ ] battery looks with the card on it like I mean like with this blue I mean like yeah that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire but with it any color it looks [ __ ] sick I don't know tell me what you guys think down below in the comments like I said um this video was saying this is like my review video but I'm also really interested to know what you guys think of the products - so beep like leave your guys's review go in the comments even even though you guys don't get to like actually smoke on it like I'm doing I get it like you review on like the look since [ __ ] you know I'm saying so tell me what you guys think down below if you have tried them like if you have tried this company in the past I tell me what you what you thought at the Brian you know what I'm saying but with that being said I'm gonna put this on the lowest temperature so I can like get the full at the full taste the full flavor and I'm saying so we're preheating it up right now so that way gets the it gets ready for me to hit it so it's ready for me to hit it so cheers if you're smoking along with me let's get it the thing that I am found out about these carts is like if you really want to get the full full flavor like their folk well it's kind of common sense but um like if you want like the full flavor like they taste so [ __ ] good if you put it on like the lowest temperature and like you barely rip it like you just for a couple seconds like he's like you see nothin I didn't take like the fattest trip I just kind of like hit it a little bit to get like the taste you should taste like a [ __ ] vapor oh it doesn't even taste like the wax like it tastes so good so flavor I'm already giving the flavor five out of five that [ __ ] was [ __ ] so far mmm what is that his like um it tastes so [ __ ] so familiarly I don't know what that [ __ ] flavor is but the flavor it tastes so I mean it tastes so like familiar like I've I've tasted this before somewhere like um it has like that artificial like blueberry flavor you know what I'm saying like that artificial taste but um like I don't I don't even know what the [ __ ] of your blueberry tastes like but like the article fit okay it's like the artificial flavor you're not I mean but it tastes like a really familiar like I don't know if it's like a gum or like a candy or something that that I had when I was a kid or what the [ __ ] it tastes like but I can't I can't think of it but I know it tastes like something that really really similar to something that I've had in the past but yeah like you know like the flavor on this though like five out of five like I said like it tastes like you're hitting a [ __ ] mod like oh my god I nicotine mug you know I mean like it tastes fire oh one of the best tasting [ __ ] wife spins I've had by far like a hundred percent um so I just put it on medium tempo I'm gonna take a couple fatter hits and get a little rating for the high the high I guess and the smoke so yeah Cheers [ __ ] I [ __ ] up on that one mmm that [ __ ] tastes so fire made that one more time so I mean you see it [ __ ] rip so like um the taste 5 out of 5 the way it smokes it gets 5 out of 5 the high they're not the [ __ ] best cards like I've had way better cards like if you seen in my last couple reviews I did a brand called select um select elite premium vapes um their cards are stupid [ __ ] fire but they're like 40 bucks for a half gram card which is like really really expensive but that [ __ ] is stupid fire um these are definitely not on that level but that for the price point [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire um if you ever see these in your area definitely pick them up tell me what you think of them or even if you don't have the chance to tell me what you think of them just [ __ ] pick them up because they're fire I'm not sure like but they have like their own store or what it is but I said that the price point on these were it was like 22 or 23 dollars yeah I'd definitely pick one of these up if you have a if you ever see these in your [ __ ] area definitely pick one of these up evil labs extracts are not just evil labs a cannabis and vault evolved that's what it's called that's that's the brand um yeah topaz packaging definitely picked one of them up you can't beat it for the price point in my opinion 1500 milligrams of THC a battery for 60 bucks that's that's a [ __ ] steal so the tastes on this is a 5 out of 5 but that's [ __ ] crazy I can't like it tastes [ __ ] insane the smoke do you see I'm getting like fat rips watch yeah so I don't think the camera really picked that up as well as like you could see it in person but this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um this the way it smokes you get a 5 out of 5 to the price point 5 out of 5 quality of the cart like I said I've had way better cards in the past but for the price point I think in the past videos I gave him three and a half but after smoking on them for a couple days they're kind of growing on me and I come I'm kind of liking them a little bit more so I don't know just after smoking them for the last couple days I'm gonna I'm gonna raise my score up to a four so the so the high gets a 4 out of 5 and I guess I'll keep the quality of the oil at a 3.5 Obama raised too high though for so yeah I guess the overall score at the cart a 4 out of 5 that's like the overall score for the everything combined 4 out of 5 3 cards 500 milligrams each totaled 1500 milligrams and you get a battery sixty [ __ ] dollars that's how [ __ ] steal can't beat at my opinion definitely picked them up like I said definitely tried them out here's the brand I was talking about was select this is actually Paris oh gee yeah if you want to see a ever actually did a review on this course if you want to see that go check that out but like I was talking about they're [ __ ] a forty bucks for a half a gram but yeah those are stupid fire you can go check it out if you want the review but yeah like I said this card 4 out of 5 but I still have one more left to review so if you guys want to see a review on the strain or flavor of tropical fruit tumble down below in the comments and I'll get a review out for that and then they just got some new fire ass card set the dispensary right down the road for me someone pick a couple of those up if you guys want to see some more these videos um if you guys enjoyed these like car reviews or

thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it's been around here a peace out", "TgZKffhLbNE": "[Music] [Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a4 cartridge this is the a for transferring a4 cartridge right here it features a ceramic heating chamber a plastic construction exterior with and Comstock with a black plastic mouthpiece to begin disassembling this cartridge for filling first pull off the black mouthpiece simply snaps off you will then see a metal plug that you must unscrew like so then you're left with the cartridge itself and the cartridge has a center fill hole so to begin filling this cartridge what you will do is take a syringe that's prefilled with your material now if you order anything from transferring USA it will always come with a blunt tip filling syringe this particular syringe has a 15 gauge blunt tip needle meaning that it won't pierce your skin in is safe to use I suggest using a 15 gauge needle or higher the higher the gauge size the thinner the needle you don't want the needle to be too thick because when you insert it into your fill hole here in the cartridge to begin filling you want the needle to be slim enough to fit inside as well as to let air escape from the cartridge as you're filling it with oil so to begin filling simply insert your syringe into the fill hole and place it all the way to the very bottom of the cartridge and begin to inject your material inside to the desired fill volume once you've achieved the proper volume that you want simply withdraw the needle place it down and this is very important within 30 seconds of that fill place your metal plug on the top and screw it down into place to complete the capping process this is very important because you want the oil inside to have a small vacuum and this can only be achieved by placing the cap on within 30 seconds of filling once you've placed the metal cap on you can then snap on the black plastic mouthpiece by simply pushing it into place until it clicks and then if you are performing a hot fill which means that the material inside of the syringe you've injected has been heated above ambient air temperature then you're going to want to perform one more very important step and that is to take the filled cartridge and flip it upside down immediately and store it upside down for the next two to three hours what this does is it drives the small air bubble that you've trapped inside here to what would have been the bottom of the cartridge which then connects directly to the outside atmosphere allowing that air bubble to expand and contract without pushing oil back and forth to the heating chamber this is very important if you're performing a hot fill if you're performing a cold fill or an ambient fill meaning that your material in the syringe is the exact same air temperature as the air around it then this step is unnecessary however if you are performing a hot field be sure to fill cap within 30 seconds and then flip upside down for two to three hours and or until the oil inside cools and that's it", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "YS3lIdVcucA": "[Music] hey guys dr sean maravici here and it's time for another cannabis product review today i'm reviewing something that i've wanted to review for a long time something that's been requested for review for a long time and i finally got around to it and i'm really glad i did today's reviews on the pineapple express 510 cartridge from good supply uh so i've reviewed uh something from good supply before i think was the blue dream so if you want to get a lot of information about good supply and their parent company aphria i'll refer you to that review but in short a good supply comes out of leamington ontario so close by to where i live in toronto ontario and canada and their licensed producer is a huge licensed producer here in canada called aphria and they turn out really good product good quality they have this sort of 509 process that i talked about in the other review um just making sure that the quality control is really high on it so enough about that let's get into some of the details about price and everything so on the ontario cannabis store this is actually on sale right now it's normally 43.95 and that's for how much is this one gram i believe uh 0.5 grams so that's for 0.5 grams but right now there's a price drop so uh go and grab it it's 39.95 right now so what that boils down to is six dollars fifty cents uh for every point one gram which puts it into i would say that's um that's on the lower end of um of price point for the 510 cartridges sort of low to medium end um so it's well priced now a little bit more about the actual oil in here it's sourced from a hybrid strain which is pineapple express so it's a hybrid um it contains 77 to 83 thc making it categorized as very strong and i'd agree with that um it's pretty much got zero to point eight percent cbd so there's not much cbd to speak of inside of this oil a few other things about the um just the write-up on this oil uh they talk a lot about the terpenes in here so uh it has well we'll get into flavor in a second but they say that it's got a smooth tropical flavor um the terpene profile includes things like limonene um which is sort of something you'll find having citrusy notes uh it's got um some mercene in there which has more of an earthy note it's got humulene again earthy notes lionel which has this sort of floral lavendary kind of note to it so there's a whole kind of mishmash of flavors going on in here and you end up getting a really pleasant tasting vapor okay pineapple express this taught me a really valuable lesson in terms of buying cannabis and especially trying out a lot of different products so this is case in point every person is an individual and every cannabis product because we're dealing with something that comes from a plant that has you know thousands of different chemical components to it is very individual and some people are going to respond to products uh differently than than others and it might take some time for you to figure out what product really gels with you and i'll tell you this product really gels with me and i'll tell you why so uh first off you know um why i didn't see it coming that i would like this product so much is that uh it's it's a pretty common product um and it's uh it's not an expensive product so um you know i just thought that it would probably be like most other uh cartridges that i tried but no it's very unique in how um and how it affects my body chemistry so uh let's uh let's open it up first uh so it comes in this great good supply box i really like the cool sort of green color of it i also like how it's a really sturdy feeling box it's not like flimsy paper like some of the other ones and it's got these really nice dense tabs that you can push in to release the inside of the box so i'll do that now so then the inside comes out and this is kind of the format of a lot of 510 cartridges and then your cartridge is in here pull that out uh i took off their ill come with like a little protector plastic protector on the bottom 510 thread and a protector on the top of the mouthpiece as well but i've removed those and it's got this nice sort of metallic mouthpiece that you know it feels quite heavy and sturdy and and it's got a nice sort of mouth feel to it too and then you just like all 510 cartridges rotate it right into your 510 battery so uh let's first talk about the flavor so i really liked how i think was one of um of my subscribers described it as sort of like a nice sweet tea flavor you know that's pretty accurate it kind of has this subtle sweet herbal flavor to it so i would say that i could pick up on any of the particular terpenes but they kind of all work together like the citrus the floral the earthy notes to kind of come together in this sort of sweet herbaly flavor it's not overpowering but you can definitely taste it and it doesn't really have a very cannabis-y flavor or scent to it unlike some of the other cartridges that that i reviewed recently like the um the green organic dutchman that you know that really kind of tastes like cannabis this has more of sort of like a florally sweet flavor to it so good flavor now uh effects so uh this one so i've been using this for probably about three weeks now so a little bit longer than some of the other cartridges that i've reviewed so i've really pinpointed the effects setting in at around 10 minutes so there's a bit of a lag between when you first take your puffs of the vaporizer to when you're really going to start to feel the effects it's about 10 minute lag there now the effects so this one has a real nice body effect to it and if you've watched my reviews that's that's what i like i like body effect i like relaxed muscles i like to feel the effects right through my whole body i don't really love those cartridges and those strains that are really sort of heady i like it when it's sort of more of a full body experience and pineapple express hit it right on the mark so who would have thought you know i've tried it's a hybrid i've tried a lot of indica strains a lot of sativa strains i've tried a lot of hybrid strains and really i can't think of any other cartridge that really gave me that body effect like this one that being said it's quite strong so i find that i need somewhere between one and maybe three but usually one really good sort of vape session and i had a um a previous post about how to vape properly so if you really give it a good vape one might be enough for you and it certainly is enough for me the majority of the time um so yeah so it's quite strong the effects last for uh quite you know a little bit longer than most other cartridges i would say around two hours maybe even two and a half hours i could still feel the effects from this one um and there's no like i don't get headaches really with this one there was the odd time that i would get a headache but um you know some other cartridges definitely it's like every time i get a headache with it um hasn't really been the case with this one you know i would say maybe 10 of the time um i get a little bit of a headache when i use this product but in general it's a really clean feeling it's got that great body effect i take this before bed it's really good to relax me and get ready for bed and you're not felt you don't feel really sort of sleepy and burnt out afterwards even um so like if you were using it not um not directly related to sleep you'd be okay i think um you wouldn't be too tired or sedated um with the use of this it's just a really relaxing product so yeah so that's really pineapple express in a nutshell this is definitely going to be one of my top three cartridges that i've reviewed and for that reason i'm giving this one a 10 out of 10. i really love it price is good flavor's on point it's got the effects that i really like so go out give it a try tell me what you guys think do you love it um did you think it was so so you know let me know let me know about the pineapple express and i'll be back with some more exciting reviews i've got some interviews with some shop owners coming up i got some more cannabis education so definitely stay tuned subscribe and i'll be back shortly", "evWCqaf4EX4": "hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "ZlBRAmONxNA": "yo what's up guys welcome back to another [ __ ] video now today we are going to be showing you guys something that we came across today it's a little unusual but if you guys are a fan of this channel you may have seen my other video where i was telling you guys how to spot a fake glow cartridge well today we actually came across a [ __ ] fake glow cart now when we first got this [ __ ] we were hitting it we didn't really see anything wrong with it but the flavor was [ __ ] off it did taste a little funny so i was taking a closer look at it and i could pretty much tell that it did the cartridge did look a little different from the normal ones that i am usually getting now a birdie he does not approve of this i do not approve of this people should not be making fake cartridges like this this [ __ ] is gonna kill someone um i'm gonna play a close-up video showing you guys more about the cart like the bottom of it but i just want to make this video to if you guys have a glow cart and you're wanting to make sure it's real or not this is a pretty clear way to see if it's real just compared to this cart so i'm gonna play that video real quick oh so these are the cars my guys um as you can maybe see off the bat uh the one on the left has a bigger [ __ ] glow extracts logo in the middle which you know that's a little spooky guys and um also as you can see that [ __ ] thing in the middle that [ __ ] kind of looks big as [ __ ] like thick ass [ __ ] ring in the middle if you guys know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about and this one the middle the middle piece looks pretty damn thin obviously you can't really see it compared to the other one because it's not full but yeah guys that's pretty much what they look like compared to each other and also at the bottom of them hold up let me show you guys this [ __ ] oh there's a little [ __ ] as you guys can see uh the one on the right i don't know how to explain that but you guys see that [ __ ] just looks a little different the font or whatever it's thicker letters yeah so that's kind of what you want to look out if you got a [ __ ] fake blow cart doesn't look a little dark but that [ __ ] has been damn near isn't that right all right guys so this concludes this [ __ ] video but for you guys you know i'ma [ __ ] rip this piece of poop uh [Music] stop it", "3Y-JU0l7RiQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all

"z8Ga2A0sTwQ": "[ __ ] Boise man and today I got a wee review I was gonna post this up yesterday but I enjoyed it too much and huh I liked it anyway so today's strain is a Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies and the cartridge is a distiller 1/2 gram and it's made by Burano I believe that's a Maryland company that's one from and it's a hybrid so THC percentage is 80% and I don't know how I think CBDs got 3.11 and yeah so it's got a good taste yeah unbelievable I mean I after like through two seconds I'm coughing my ass off like this is for all the people that said that my cookies cart was fake right but i'ma show y'all this one right and y'all gonna see oh hold on hold on why I said look the same okay so this is the box right y'all and that's right yeah Girl Scout cookies yeah 60 bucks four or five or you know for a half a gram and here we go right here so look at that beautiful oh yeah I'm beautiful too so beautiful man so perfect so I'll just drive it right I'm a little pen so we're gonna do a pre I think this is dead it would die on our view huh so", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe p2 out peace you", "4N2nhPj4aok": "[Music] here's how to use forea and power before you start take a few deep breaths to wake up your lungs micro dosing is much more effective when you're relaxed and prepared for a new state of mind using foria and power is easy there's no button just inhale start with a short puff about one second long there's no need to inhale fast or strong just a smooth easy breath exhale and enjoy the flavor you should see some vapor a three-second inhale is about four milligrams of CBD one milligram of THC it's a very gentle micro dose the longer you inhale the hotter the vapor and the stronger the dose so if you cough or anything just take a shorter puff if this is your first time wait a minute or two to see how you feel before you take another tip [Music] you", "nPK-_hqhWA4": "let me sit down in my throne what's up you guys welcome back to my channel kawaii aka coco back it again with another [ __ ] video and today's video we are trying out something new i should tell by the title i am going to be trying out this delta a cartridge for the first time if you go back like two videos then you'll see that i did a goody kind unboxing and they sent me this delta a cartridge it's actually a new product on their line their store link will be pinned in the comments or in the description down below i didn't even have a battery for this and they went ahead and sent me a battery so i was like [ __ ] yes this company is so generous yeah i'm just so grateful that they sent me this and i get to try it but yeah um before we get into this i want to explain what delta a is because i actually just now started to hear about it so i'll try my best to explain what it is but basically delta 8 is a cannabinoid everybody's heard of delta 9 but if you don't know what delta 9 is it's like the main cannabinoid and thc that gives you that high effect but delta 8 is basically just like the reduced version of that you know it doesn't get you like high like delta 9 does it still gets you medicated you know but it's not going to get you like so medicated where you're just like i'm so strong bro no it's not going to be like that but yeah that's basically it when they sent me this i was like are they allowed to send me this but it turns out that delta a is actually federally legal and the reason that it's federally legal is because it is extracted from a hemp plant and that's super duper dope and i can't wait to try this i did smoke a bowl this morning but i waited until my high wore off so i could be completely sober for this to give you guys like a nice review on how i feel and things like that as you guys know i don't usually vape i bought a couple of thc cards in my lifetime before but they were never any good but this one's like legit it came it came in a whole [ __ ] box but i don't i don't mind vaping it's a discreet way to get even though this isn't like delta 9 thc it's a discreet way to get high to get stoney and you can't smell it maybe i should do like a video on how to be like a discreet stoner if you guys want to see that video comment down below let me know what you want to see from me but yeah um this is what the packaging looks like i don't know if it's pronounced goody kind or good kind but it is a delta eight thc vape card trick with 92 percent delta 8 thc organically grown pesticide free lead free co2 extracted no thickenings no flavorings third party test it and it gives like a warning on the package and tells you that it was tested and all that good stuff also they donate 1 8 to the navajo water project so go ahead and check them out they're very affordable focus beach they're very affordable and they're super duper nice company so please go check them out and i'm just very excited to get into this i'm gonna turn it on green there we go we got a flashing green and see if that does me well but um this is what it looks like you guys it's like almost clear i'ma go ahead and puff on this for you guys hold on it's flashing but i don't know what that means see i don't even know how to work i don't even know how to work vape pins y'all am i doing this right why is it flashing does it need to be charged oh my gosh y'all i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing i'm just trying to do a nice review but my ass does not know how to work vape pins it's like flashing and i don't think it's supposed to be flashing so i'm gonna charge it um brb okay so while this is charging what's up i apologize my ass was not prepared today you guys oh know man this pen didn't come with any instructions so i just don't have to figure it out myself okay so while we wait i'm gonna play some among us i wish we could smoke a bow i don't know how long this is gonna take [ __ ] yes this battery charged in like 15 minutes you guys that's [ __ ] dope but it finished charging right when i finished the round of a mangas we get to try this [ __ ] let's try this distill it out i'm do it on green we got it on free flashy flashy flashy i'm excited i'm excited [Music] oh whoa i'm in pain holy [ __ ] my ass was not expecting that this [ __ ] rips honey hold on do over do over do over cut take two my chest is a heaven then this [ __ ] knocked me out damn i should have started slow hold him a [ __ ] needs some h2o okay now we know that this pin rips well let's let's see how the [ __ ] delta eight tastes man i'm crying [Music] oh [ __ ] this actually does not have a taste it says no flavoring i said that from the beginning oh [ __ ] it says no flavoring but it hits so smooth you guys it's like airy you can't even feel it in your mouth that's how it took too big of a rip you can't even feel it in your mouth holy [ __ ] it smells like like a burnt coil to be honest like what you usually get from vapes that's also one thing that i didn't really like [ __ ] with with vapes is that like it gave like a a a metal taste and like a burnt smell but this one doesn't taste like metal it doesn't taste like anything it just smells like like a hot coil because that's what's happening right here you know this is nice uh this is nice what i read is that it gives you a head and and a body high so we'll see i don't know man i feel in a head rush right now but it's probably because i uh almost had a near-death experience this rips y'all and this is only on green how long maybe if i put it on blue it would have less of a smell unless you like sniff on it you can't smell it it still has like a slight smell but i just feel like that's just gonna come with any vape but enough about the the vape pen let's talk about the delta a i'm liking it so far you guys um it's very light it's not harsh on the throat unless you take too big of a hit like i did it's pretty most definitely it's so [ __ ] gorgeous it doesn't really have a smell just the pen has a smell it doesn't have a taste if you want something like really light and mellow like with like the effects and the taste and the the handling of it this will be perfect for you dude delta a is also said to help a lot with anxiety and i [ __ ] struggle with anxiety i've struggled with social anxiety most of my life and i know when i go outside i get all [ __ ] anxious and now i can have like something very discreet because i can't just like smoke like a cbd joint outside because people are going to be like the [ __ ] is that but nowadays people vape thc so they're probably gonna know what the [ __ ] this is especially if it's in a pen then they're gonna know something's up but you know no cop is gonna stop me like is it a vape pen and it has no smell you guys oh and plus it's federally legal even if the cop did stop me it is federally legal nice i'm actually starting to feel it in my arms and my feet i started working out lately you guys and my legs have been killing me my legs feel better oh wow this is nice i'm actually feeling a body high i don't know if i'm going to feel a head high i only feel like i feel like a head rush is because i cough so hard and you know once you when you cough so hard yeah your brain gets to like posting and [ __ ] like that but i'm definitely feeling like a body calm right now like i'm being medicated it definitely helped with my muscle pain that i was having earlier today in the past couple of days dude and i'm only taking a few puffs [Music] [Music] a lot of people like to use thc to help with like headaches and pains like that i have never felt those effects from thc i've had headaches and tried to just use thc without any ibuprofen but it never it never worked for me i feel that like cbd works a lot better for pain and things like that instead of thc but i heard that a lot of people use thc to help with pain but this has actually helped with pain it's weird it's so weird how this plant works dude it's like absolutely amazing and the fact that it's not accepted by most people that could probably benefit off of it is so mind-blowing to me i feel like this would be really good for somebody that has like a really low tolerance or somebody starting off like a newbie i feel like this would be really good for them i'm not talking way too much when i'm in a good mood i talk way too much this is nice y'all man i like this a lot i feel like my eyes got lower i don't know does like all cannabinoids do that or does like just delta nine make your eyes lower because delta a probably also make your eyes lower hold on we have a phone we have um wi-fi we can google it are my eyes red yes delta eight makes your eyes hella droopy and glazed over so if you do smoke delta eight then you will also have like the same effects in your eyes because i legit feel my eyes lower yeah i'm feeling good this is like literally just like a mild not even a mild high it's just like a little lower than that bro bro i don't know i feel like i feel like i'm feeling a high to be honest i feel like i'm feeling behind i think i took a lot of puffs and it's still it's still to the tippy top [Music] yeah i like this a lot goodie kind thank you i never knew my limit and i didn't know there was like a limit when i first started smoking cannabis and i would like green out i greened out like about two to three times before and i didn't know anything about cbd or delta eight and delta a is really good for nausea so if you're prone to green and out if you don't know what green and now means it's like basically overdosing on thc but you get sick like you your stomach feels sick you get nauseous i feel like if you were to smoke this like in between hits or just like smoke a few puffs before you smoke thc then it will help a lot with um that nausea feeling oh no i'm not trying to sound like a scientist but these are just conclusions theories conclusions and theories no i just had a [ __ ] idea do a science project while high how fun would that be how fun would that be but anyway yeah if you had if you struggle with anxiety or if you struggle with like the effects of thc or you just simply don't like the effects of thc then i would recommend this to you to be honest i do feel a little high and if you just do not like that high feeling then you it's probably best for you to just stick to cbd you know man i feel good my body feels good my shoulders feel relaxed this is so good and i'm so grateful that i was able to try this out and able to keep this product as my own thank you so much goody kind thank you everybody and thank you just like you know just thanks but um yeah i think that's it i feel a little stoned to be honest i'm not gonna lie i feel a little stoned but yeah i think that's all

do a delta 8 gummy review and i definitely was not opposed to that so i decided to try out the 3g brand because that's one of the most common brands of delta eight that i've come across and there's a bunch of pretty solid reviews on there so let's check it out now i actually had to buy this one i didn't get an offering to do it for free but whatever wasn't too bad they're currently 25 off right now so we have here the gummies i got the watermelon flavor they have watermelon or black raspberry i'm just going to give you a quick breakdown try it out come back later let you know what's going on so i got the larger pack there's 32 servings in here serving size is half a gummy i really want to take two but just for the sake of trying it out for the first time and giving you guys a solid review i'm just gonna try one just so i don't get blasted out of my mind because i did see some pretty interesting reviews that even one gummy would do the job for a while before i do that let me first read the back and try to reenact my initial reaction so i turn it around and then i see right here can take up to four hours what to feel full effects that's not really a good actor but i don't know i've seen some of the reviews say it's just been one hour until they feel the effects i highly doubt it's gonna take four hours i did eat some food before this the ingredients i'll post them up on the screen it's basically just a bunch of sugar and hemp extract this feels like one big gelatinous blob i don't even know how these will separate but let's see oh these smell really good they are pretty separated it looks like so it's not that big jello blob i thought it was so let me try one out wow ooh damn it tastes like that old school bubble yum watermelon or whatever the brand was called let me just read a couple of these reviews that i'm looking at on their website here because i'm not going to get too too in-depth with anything with that because you can check it out for yourself i'll link it in the description and probably post some screenshots here too so the first one that got me anonymous may 11th 2020 eat a handful and you will literally be tripping i doubt i'll be fully tripping but i don't know maybe a handful would uh you know definitely do something i don't want to quite need a handful yet maybe at a later date um just to you know cost effectiveness and everything let's see here anonymous may 11th they are tasty great consistency i wish they weren't out of stock all the time that's partially why i jumped on buying these because apparently they're out of stock a lot and for some reason my new phone is freezing when i'm going onto the site so whatever so overall taste is great i'll be back in a while hopefully not four hours and i'll let you know what's going on and then i'll probably based on what i'm feeling have another one so we'll see see you in a bit these are [ __ ] great it's about 6 30 p.m now i took the first one at i think it was around noon so i rode my bike down to the park i usually do this and it wasn't too cold out so i ended up for just a couple hours really a mix of working out stretching riding my bike whatever and then as this stuff continues to just you know kick in it was it was awesome so absolutely perfect especially if you if you've ever you know when you kind of just get in that groove of either working out or stretching or whatever and then everything just feels phenomenal and i just look like a weirdo doing all these weird stretches in the park and whatever so i'm back now i took a shower and like i said it's around 6 30. it definitely would i feel like this feeling would definitely just kind of last feel like it's leveled off and now it's kind of slowly calming down and i feel like this would last this still uh like the euphoric very nice just both uh both body high and then just mental high of just feeling just really nice really relaxed and it's fantastic so i'm sure the vast majority of you know exactly what i'm talking about so these are 100 worth it based on what the price is and then having 16 in here and mind you the serving size is one half gummy and i just took one full i would never suggest just going outside of the full dosage the first time you try it because everyone's tolerance is different but with that said i'm just gonna have one more and i'll be back tomorrow to let you know i assume it's just going to add on to the current effects spike them up again and whatever so i'm just going to enjoy the rest of my evening have this and i'll be back tomorrow morning and let you know what's up the next day wow i absolutely love these so the second gummy as the other one i said was kind of just wearing off after several hours the next one definitely i'd say started to kick in but is the way i experienced it is that that leveling off just kind of built up again and i went to sleep and say maybe around 11 o'clock and i was definitely feeling it for sure no signs of that slowing down or anything i slept great i woke up today i'm still pretty early i've been getting up pretty early even on the weekends and i noticed maybe the slightest bit of grogginess but it wasn't anything that you know made me sleep in for a long time or feel uh bad or impact me negatively or anything but all i contribute that to was just the fact that i had two of them and then the last one i think was around six or seven pm and uh yeah so it wasn't really even a bad thing at all i just wanted to mention that little aspect and that kind of occurred the first time i tried a delta 8 anyway after not having any sort of thc for several months but if you were looking for a gummy delta a thc whatever a good substitute to delta 9 thc and especially if you are trying to find something that's not smokable and edible this is a hundred percent awesome i love this and as with the other uh tinctures and everything but this one was very familiar to the erita hemp tincture that i still need to post a review on but maybe by the time you're watching this video that's already up so check that out but these were very intense very similar to even having a delta nine edible but it was still no sort of paranoia or anxiety or any anxiety or anything i know people mentioned the paranoia and anxiety can be a bit less on delta eight which is you know i find that to be true but even throughout years of smoking or eating whatever delta nine i feel like the anxiety and the paranoia that one can experience with that just in my experience just in my personal opinion it really all depends on your mindset beforehand because i've known that in times of my life when i was when i had much more much higher levels of anxiety in general and you know whether it be anxiety depression whatever other lifestyle factors things that have been going on in my life at the time that the majority of time that i would smoke pot or delta nine my anxiety levels chances are i would my anxiety level levels would go up exponentially when i would smoke until i'd have to actively just force myself to calm down really and just relax and enjoy it and then other times i would have it frequently and that did not occur at all so i feel like a lot of it has to do with your mindset but once again you know thc the endocannabinoid system and everything it's all going to be entirely different from person to person the way they feel the effects as is with these gummies or certain delta a cartridges or certain types of bud whatever the way i experience these gummies here could be totally different for you depending on where you're at in your life your own genetics a bunch of other things but me personally awesome so if you are into this type of stuff which you probably are if you're watching this video and you've been curious what these three chee gummies were like that's how they were for me so i'll put a link in the description below if you want to check out their main website i'm not affiliated with affiliated with them at all but hey if you want a business partner 3g let me know and i can help you out by you sending me more stuff and i can review it so that'll be it for the video if you like it any comments criticisms whatever leave that down below subscribe like all that stuff whatever and i'll be making some more videos that's it see you next time", "3_GUAHBcnmE": "what's happening everyone it's scary carrie here welcome to my channel today's episode i'm gonna give you guys a real delta eight thc review from the un packaging to the full experience we're gonna waste deep in the delta eight give you guys a nice vibe go to the beach this episode is actually being sponsored by a delta eight company they sent me some products so i gotta go pick it up right now and once i get those in hand i'll show you guys what's up with their products what's up with their brand and really see how this stuff hits let's check it out disclaimer the following video does not glorify the use of cannabis instead it attempts to be non-biased while delivering vital information disguised as entertainment all right you guys we just pulled up picked up the precious cargo right here check it out yes this company is called delta eight hemp they gave me this whole info sheet as well some great literature here so they're saying that this is actually hemp derived delta eight so that means they're doing some type of thing to where they're able to convert the cbd concentrate into a delta eight somehow that's pretty cool in any case today we're going to be reviewing their disposable vape i want to try out the disposable vape because i feel as though every single disposable is different this one's just a standard cart we've seen plenty of those so they have let's see it says uh ingredients hemp extract and terpenes just what i like i actually haven't smoked all day you guys i usually like to wake and bake i don't know about y'all but i thought i'd give you guys a very clear-headed start off sober go straight into the delta 8 review i don't want any other highs interfering with this here are the lab results they have the lab results on the packaging that is great let's see asan we're at a 89 delta eight and we have two other cannabinoids we have some cbda and cbd cool absolutely no thc in here apparently by taking delta eight you're giving yourself a tolerance break from delta nine i don't know if like a one day tolerance break is going to make much of a difference but we'll see how it goes what i don't like about these lab results is they don't tell you what terpenes are in there all these lab results are telling me is the base oil that they used before they added the terpenes oh well let's crack this thing open nice boom cool i like this uh little grip here that's that's kind of nice i don't know oh i guess it's right-handed i'm left-handed so um interesting interesting all right well this will take some getting used to i should have read the directions for this take one puff wow all right cool let's see how this goes cheers so the strain is apparently skywalker apparently it's a hybrid tastes good i don't know man whenever people put names of the strains on these things i always take it with a grain of salt you already know though but it is really tasty i'll give them that that's fun little logo right here that's cool all right well i do want to try to get some sunlight for you guys try to go to the beach get you guys some views try out this delta 8 a little more it's a really hot day i'm not trying to hotbox today i only took two puffs and i'm already sweating it's like i think it's like 88 degrees outside last time i checked so it's pretty hot for where i'm at does this thing even light up i don't know let's see it does not we can't do blinkers with this you guys in any case we're just gonna try to hit this for as long as possible and see if there is an end to it but before we do that let's get out of this car all right you guys we just pulled up to a wonderful spot out here it's a clear as hell day you can see all the islands out i mean like wow we gotta go out there but before we do that let's hit this let's try to get as fat of a rip as we can out of this cheers wow now some fat clouds oh my god no more of that [Music] it is so nice out i really enjoy this area because i feel as though you can just like drive along the coast and just pull over at any point and you'll find this like just really nice private walking areas i like to take advantage of the area come out here catch some vibes get myself straight on this d8 wow look at this look at this nice patch of grass right here there's a really nice spot to just post up i think this is not bad at all keeping me nice and mellow setting the vibes just right i just love listening to the waves feeling that nice ocean breeze getting away from all the people i feel as though if you go to the main beaches right now it'll be like pretty crowded because it's just so nice out in the middle of winter so for me i like to stay away from all that i hope you guys are staying warm staying safe out here in la it's pretty crazy that is nice look at that there's like a whole resort over there look at all these houses yeah which house would you guys want to live in that house that house i like that one if i had a big house like that i would have huge windows for sure just have nice big windows so you can see the ocean that would be that'll be it for sure so i want to give you guys a little rundown of what i'm trying to do with the channel scary carry through this channel just want to give you guys some solid reviews on some cannabis related products give you guys some tips and tricks to make your experience lifted that much more and also i just want to provide you guys a vibe if you want to join me smoke with me vape with me whatever it is you are more than welcome if you want to just come for the ride you're also welcome to do that too right now i'm feeling a little adventurous i kind of want to check out what's over there the architecture is crazy we definitely gotta check it out all right let's keep walking i want to go over there because it's nice and grassy over there lay out and it looks like a pretty good view so hopefully it's like a public area and i could just chill oh my god you guys there's a bunny just roaming around and a bunch of squirrels check it out this is the rabbit out here by the ocean are you doing here what what it's a freaking safari out here oh my god maybe i'll take another rip right now uh-oh i kind of scratched it up already my bad got some battle scars wow so we didn't make it to our magical spot across the way but this is a pretty cool spot nice and cozy right on this cliff right here how do people get down there i've been like looking for a way down i'm not convinced that there are safe ways or at least ways that i would take down no way none of that i might be slightly terrified of heights you guys you can see how far from the edge i am i just realized i'm like sitting at like the edge of this cliff but this cliff is like part of this nice little cove right here that's pretty cool i'd say this stuff is not bad kind of gives you a little tingle in your nose ah jeez not too slumped like with that purple punch definitely a hybrid feel hybrid type of high i think like delta eight definitely allows me to keep a clear head i think with delta 9 i feel like i can have like sometimes like short-term memory loss sometimes like maybe i'll just like get so high that my brain feels kind of foggy like i definitely feel more of like the body high effects from delta eight rather than the psychoactive effects i don't think it really impairs my judgment that much but like i'm not feeling like crazy or anything you know i'm not feeling like fearful i'm pretty chill pretty tame right now just catching some sun and looking at all these people doing their yard work at these houses that they don't live at i always wanted to get a house out here i mean if i could another thing that i really like about delta eight is it doesn't make me like lazy like delta nine i feel like when you're smoking regular thc it kind of like decreases my motivation i'll admit let me know in the comments if you relate does thc kill your motivation and if so does delta 8 also kill your motivation or does it help because for me i don't get any couch lock effects with this i feel like i could get up and go probably go on like a light jog if i was uh that type of person so let's see are my eyes red no delta eight i don't know does it get your eyes red i don't really get red eyes anymore i used to it's amazing i literally watch people drive by they'll look at the ocean and then they'll they'll pull over and stop the car and hop out for a sec this one motorcyclist did just that he just he was just like yo i gotta catch this view real quick hopped off his bike pulled up his visor stood right on the edge took it in all right time to carry on look at that that's nice i almost thought i was inhaling it from the wrong side all right let's get some food i'm hungry all right you guys so we just pulled up the fat burger i have been craving fat burger um my girlfriend's gonna hate me because she's been craving burgers too and i told her uh i'll get burgers with you but now i'm getting a burger right now so uh-oh i hope this isn't clogged there we go all right so don't take too fat of rips otherwise you might get some clogging another thing that i worry about with these the disposables especially if you're going to pack a whole gram in here is making sure the battery lasts as long as the oil napkins yes french fries look at these fat fries check this out boom this looks intense guys diligently let us dig in holy there's a lot of juices i think taking that d8 prior to this was the move that was so good but we cannot forget the prize ah are you guys i'm nice and full now that delta eight has got me on a very nice level i would say my judgment is not as impaired i don't feel myself fumbling around with what i have to say so i think those are all really good signs i'd recommend it there's not too much deviation amongst delta eight so really when you go into a certain brand a lot of it is based off of how it tastes so as long as it tastes really good and you like the high that you get based off of the terpene profile then it could be the one for you as for the skywalker very fantastic daytime high highly recommend it it's a great hybrid i'm not slumped at all there's points where it's like if i laid down i could probably fall asleep really easily but i'm not drowsy by any means i highly recommend this i have no idea when it's gonna die i hope it doesn't die soon i gotta go back home because i think there's a plumber working at my place and i feel like i should be there for that so i will catch you guys later if you want to see some more reviews and some tips and tricks for cannabis related products please be sure to hit that like and subscribe down below are you guys well i just got back home all right maybe one more for good luck it's been about two and a half hours since we started hitting this i'd say it is definitely a better daytime high than delta nine i said the opposite last time i take that back it's probably also contingent on the strain that you're using but the stuff is pretty nice i'm probably gonna listen to some music i don't know about you guys but i've been really into that new kid cudi album lately probably also listen to some juice world and get in my zone i hope that when you guys get nice and stoned you're able to jam out to some tunes too i hope you're able to have a nice sesh with me i hope

I bring them for 20 my voice is a little raspy right now I went to Six Flags yesterday and it got really bad but hope y'all could hear me I have another dispensary cart and it is bright labs look at that guys this is from California and it is Mendel breath it is an indica and it comes with five hundred milligrams which is zero point zero 18 ounces total and 325 milligrams of total THC which is 65 percent zero zero five milligrams of CBD which is zero one percent and if you look at it guys they come in a really nice cardboard packaging really thick and there's a doobie tube inside I just finished dosey dose of bright labs right here guys I'll tell you right now the oil on these cartridges it is a little bit dark but it's it's on fire you ain't got to worry about these being dark though because this is a dispensary career so it like supposedly said whole plant cannabis extract so whatever they get off the plants what they put in the cartridge no additives no nothing and see if I could still get a little here has a little bit left shout-out to vo-tech for this battery very amazing if you haven't got a battery yet or you're looking for a better one I definitely recommend um the vo-tech Osiris I think or siren song like that buzzy Cheers very smart it but it's some fire guys like bright lads I still got two more steep odds right here so these will be next but these for some reason I just like them really like a lot so I wanted to do another review on the next one but on the bad guys it tells you manufactured by bright labs you can find them on Instagram as bright labs and then wwr labs calm you can go there as well and the back it says clean natural whole plant cannabis extracts lovingly crafted with botanical inputs from top farms across Northern California ingredients a hundred percent kind of a soil that's it that's all that's in there and then it tells you the government warnings about you know being 21 or older eating older breastfeeding when pregnant or whatever your all that stuff driving under well vaping this isn't good I might as well do it at home or whatever and the warning of cancer and reproductive harm for vaporizing use only do not ingest orally or apply topically there it is this white seal right here is the sticker that's holding the top together and then there's one here with I'll tell you right now with the dis tested lab results and everything if the batch number is l10 866 date manufactured was eleven nine twenty eighteen package on twelve twelve twenty eighteen it was tested by CW analytics the test date was eleven twenty eight of 2018 and this cartridge will expire on 11:28 of 2019 so when you buy one of these cartridge guys you still have a four years so if you don't get so here you lose it go find it somewhere between a year you'll still be good and then the California license numbers CD pH - zero zero zero zero zero four three five right there at the bottom is this purple sticker because well holds this with a barcode look at that and then it holds this together so you either gotta rip it or you got to open the seals from here but me I'll rip it cuz it looks just like a book which is pretty nice cuz everybody tell you some inside see look at it comes like a little book and it says our whole plant cannabis extracts preserve the full spectrum of terpenes and other compounds are found in each strain for an effect that's closest to smoking flower Oh got that flower right here guys look at that so they're vapes are meant to taste just like the regular flour no additive flavors like all those Dinks or anything like that it's just straight to the point seeing it says right there no additives or fillers or you at the bottom comes in the white do we do with the California's symbol right here with the weed sign I hate my voice right now guys I'll tell you right now thank you guys so much y'all made me hit those 2000 subscribers the giveaway is coming soon I just got it CBD chief sent me something I don't know if you I've seen them they're on Instagram they're a new company they sent me the starter kit that they made for CBD right here I will I will be reviewing this soon is just is meant for like you know the sticky paws are the jewel bars I think because look at that guy's two empty ones at the top charger in the battery we'll be reviewing this soon if you know I don't need it I won't be using it as a giveaway as well they only sent me one but you know hopefully if I get in talk with them again I do have a discount code so after the review of you I want to go by one you could just put go to their website and put that no just put hyper anything for twenty and I think you get like ten percent off so if you want one just use it guys cuz you know ten percent off is something but back to the review do be to the cartridge inside all you got to do is just squeeze it pop it open card your slides out I'm gonna make sure there was no leaks you had no leaks inside and look at this guys this is a point five coaches look at this oil compared to even have any other cartridges but compared to like excuse me compared to like any other cartridge that you would think of look at this oil but look they're all you don't move look at any moving at all guys this is what they say right here no additives no nothing just whatever they got this is the older they probably got and look at it there is no leaks on the little kind hole so I know that this is the color of the overlay put in here the only thing that sucks look how much I'm missing I'm missing a pretty damn good amount right there and I haven't even tried it with this one the other one that I had word I put in here I think it just loved it yeah well with this one guys the bubble on this one was so big that I was pretty pissed cuz it felt like I lost like a point two or 0.3 no maybe like a point too but if I like I lost a lot of it cuz it was really low when I opened it and I was pretty sure he leaked but didn't have no leakage signs so look at this one it's missing a little bit as well I hope they can just you know if there if they're telling you're buying 0.5 I I expect 0.5 not like a point 4.3 does the only didn't need to work on but otherwise right labs the cartridges of fire guys if you're in the local or you're in California and you haven't tried them definitely recommend them but let's see seal at the bottom take it off these have a ceramic white tip and the RC so at the bottom it says Jupiter with the symbol C cell and then it's a L four five eight but does it at the bottom and it has a little white you know a little seat through grommet right inside here just like the thing cartridges they got should be looking for it is the same thing except these are jupiter-c cells I'll just pop in my little magnet on the cartridge for the vo-tech battery and look look at this battery boom cartridges in you can even as well unscrew this off but the cartridge is viz you screw it back on either way and then you just Cheers whoa ooh buddy that was a good hit I was a pretty good that was a pretty big draw with this veal battery whoa look at my eyes is of the first hit it made me kind of tear up a little bit but really smooth and I'll tell you right now really strong really potent oil bright labs most likely they're doing the thing they're really good I also like the cities' but some reason these just do the job better let's go for the second hit but the taste right now it just tastes like weed like regular weed like if yours just smoking flower and you don't really taste any other thing which to me is my favorite which is tell me is my favorite flavor let's go for another here guys Cheers - bug definitely tell you right now the hi I have to give it a 10 out of 10 it made me tear up twice and I'm really big I'll tell you right now I got me really relaxed kind of sleepy again it's kind of early over here but I got me kind of sleepy as well and made my eyes feel really low like a barely keep them open they look open to me but I could barely give a woman they got me high as [ __ ] guys so now high cannot attend the flavor guys to me because I like the flower flavor I got to give it a 10 out of 10 they're spot on the only thing bright labs needs to work on is just please you know just give me my 0.5 does it does all I want you know I've seen like gram cartridges like the dr. zodiac moon rock which I have the empty carts right here this is slap for this pure 100 was almost left for had a small bubble but that that's a pretty big gap so that's all I want just you know brave labs all you got to do is just just give people their point five oil don't don't shorten them a little bit cuz this one really sucked but I was missing a lot and then to be missing a good amount on here that doesn't make it any better so 38 guys just to get a little bit more baked but to tell the truth right Labs mendel breath it gets the four 10 out of 10 on everything so 20 points gotta do this for the the clipboard whoo but right here Bray Labs 20 points really good third hit just to get more baked cheers guys hope you have been smoking with me thank you for everything I've done for this channel and for us so they just keep going with this boom let's keep doing this I got more dispensary cards coming anyway so stay tuned man some really good oil hmm every hit I'll tell you right now the name of this train Mendel breath sounds mean as hell so how it's hitting it just goes with the name I'm so big so play right now guys thank you so much don't

comment down below like and subscribe and stay hi guys cheers again see you on the next one [Music]", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them

Diesel this one oh [ __ ] I can't remember what it was it was something else originally smoked at all pop the cap off refilled it with a blueberry old gene from - bacon so the last thing in here was blueberry OG and all I did was I went to a shop in California oh my god this thing is by THC clear this one is a Private Reserve so it's 30 dollars a gram to distillate this is true OG I got a couple other ones and all I do is pop this thing off is unscrewed and then all you do is pop this thing off without squirting it all over the place all right hopefully doesn't look down on me so all I do from here is I slowly squirt this [ __ ] in and you don't really know how hard it is to do until you film and try and do it but hopefully fill in the camera you just got a drip this [ __ ] slow in here not down this tube but down the side of it up the tube is where your vapor goes on these brass knuckles so you don't want to fill that thing up with oil because then you'll just suck a whole bunch over the lots on V plural that is alright so syringe empty true OG and then now I got a field brass knuckle and just stick this thing right back on [Music] you just got to make sure that when you're twisting it that it's everything's flushed sometimes you'll get it fresh out of the container and it's not really flush and some of the liquid will act not like it some of your you know your concentrate will leak out I've gotten a couple with this [ __ ] not really centered and some liquid has escaped not a whole bunch to [ __ ] about but enough to get the concerned about alright so I just filled this bastard up now let's see if she works I mean I know sure were three point seven two point seven max 3.7 if you're going bolts you know for the lowest and then for your highest on Watts it's e if I'm not mistaken it's on the Box use a Chico so I got this [ __ ] at this I usually take about three three four to five second hint and she weeks", "BMSHUp-OMew": "what up guys it's my clear three back here in another cartridge review I know it's been a minute but hey better better late than never but never late is better alright so back today I got another cartridge so I hadn't been uploaded I just been busy you know but I was excited about this one I don't know why I never tried this brand I tried a lot but anyway let's get straight into it today I we're gonna come up at you with evil lab colors tropical fruit it looks bomb it smells bomb I haven't tried it but I smelled like the cartridge tasted it a little bit let's get into the details shoot its flavored tropical fruit I don't know how flavors in the taste in it but I'm more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so that's always a good sign if your oils runny surprise stop smoking that [ __ ] man I don't know what the hell you smoking but here we go without further ado shoot it's my first time trying it I'm excited screw this bad boy off if it has a nice little I don't know I just think it's I don't know I really like presentation go there they got me they got like a good presentation and it makes you want to buy this stuff actually thought further ado cheers guys it just hits man kind of thing it does taste food fruit punch but you also get that cannabinoid flavor I got a hot flash well it's real good man like take one more hit I really like the start I think I want to try the other three cards they have the bail range and like prices from $20 for a half gram they got $30 half grams they all range from big prices but otherwise I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep poking you guys and do you guys want more reviews let me know and I'll keep I'll keep doing them yeah hi my friends", "dd5eIU55KFA": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be talking about something very hmm I don't want to say controversial but I'm gonna be talking about CBD well first and foremost just as a disclaimer I want to make it very clear that if you're not over 21 this video is not for you at all vaping is not cool it's not a toy it's not a fun thing to do the only thing you should be putting in your lungs is air guys and also just like any supplement you would take I would suggest you to check with your doctor if this is safe for you specifically because everyone has a different body everyone takes different medications and a bunch of different things so definitely make sure you ask your doctor about CBD and how it might affect you and your personal health well I vape CBD this is a vape and a vapes get a lot of scrutiny and things like that like babes are like demonized now I do not vape nicotine and vaping nicotine is like vaping a cigarette basically a lot of times people who are addicted to cigarettes or addicted to nicotine or whatever they use vape systems or mods or cigarettes and things like that to help them get off of the nicotine a Vig device is a vape device that uses like coils and cotton basically the liquid that you put in here soaks up the cotton the coil heats the cotton up and produces a vapor I got a vape to specifically vape CBD and I tried this because I know other people who vape but they usually bake nicotine and I heard about CBD and vaping CBD and also how CBD can help anxiety and a bunch of other claims which I'm going to get into if you guys more like information about how much these things cost or actual information reviews about the vape then I'll let you know what I made clear is I do not condone using drugs or anything like that so definitely definitely definitely make sure anytime I'm using a drug it's under a doctor's supervision and yeah like everyone's on this go green and natural remedies and stuff like that but just like you can be naturally allergic to peanuts oh but they are a natural angry you can eat organic peanuts a natural thing and have a reaction to it so with anything natural chemical whatever what have you you always want to check with your doctor CBD is separate from THC which is hetra Hydra been a vinyl CBD is cannabidiol it is a chemical compound extracted from the cannabis plant and unlike THC it does not get you high it does not have any psychoactive effects there's different ways you can take it you can take it as a vapor you can also take it as like an aerosol like um spray in your mouth you can also take it as a like as like drops and drop it under your tongue or the side of your cheek and things like that it's all a shock of CBD and a bunch of beauty products makeup skincare lotions body care soaps a bunch of stuff like you go in a store and CBD is all over the place but let me just tell you the claims and just facts about CBD there are claims that it helps relieve pain osteoarthritis and even cancer though there are claims that it works with your brain to kind of alter serotonin having low levels of serotonin cause depression and also anxiety so I guess they claimed that CBD comes in and alters your serotonin too I guess high in the level of serotonin and regulates that for your serotonin levels to be healthier therefore helping ease anxiety the FDA does not regulate CBD so what this means is a bunch of these products in say CBD and you don't even know what amount of CBD is in it you don't even know if it's effective because you have no way to know how much in at what percentage is the is the ingredient active the best studies that I can find on CBD is tested on animals and my problem with testings on animals is that we are not animals so much studies have been done on animals that are just not up to par with the biology of a human so a lot of these testings have been inconclusive oh my personal experience with CBD is I took 600 milligrams and 1000 milligrams I had different effects with both of them and I swapped both of them out like using some here and some there it wasn't the whole month I did like one thing I don't think it helps anxiety if you guys know if you guys watch any of my other videos I do have anxiety and adjustment disorder yeah it did not help my anxiety at all the whole month I actually had an anxiety attack this month and yeah I didn't help my anxiety I don't think pretty much anyway it did help short-term pain relief like when I had my cramps during my period it did help ease the pain of the cramps like surprisingly and also you if you like work out and things like that and you get like sore muscles it definitely does help that and me at least I saw that it helped that 1000 milligrams helped more than the 600 the 600 really didn't do much of anything what I also did was suppress my appetite I noticed this while I was taking it I noticed this quickly because I always eat I love food I eat everything and anything in front of me so I really was shocked that it had that effect on me like I lost my appetite I wouldn't have an appetite and I wouldn't feel like constantly hungry all the time but don't take this as like oh yeah let me lose weight and like take the CBD no because I actually gained weight this last past month so yeah I don't think it helps you gain weight I think it might slow down your metabolism or have some type of effects on your gastrointestinal things like that now would I recommend CBD or vaping CBD or using and buying any of these products I don't think I would only because it is so expensive for not having these Bruce the results that you want like okay so 600 mgs this you can find from like $40 to 90 like 40 to 90 right but like I said the 600 doesn't really affect you that much then once you go from 1000 and up it's pretty much a hundred dollars and up like so you're paying a lot of money for a little bit of juice that only lasts you a little while because like I said the effects last about like 30 minutes it's very short-term so the amount of money you're paying for you know a little bit of pain relief is it really worth it I don't know that is up to you and your pockets the only CBD medicine that is regulated by the FDA is epi dialects which is used to treat some cases of epilepsy but even those studies are inconclusive so yeah I feel like there's a whole big CBD epidemic going on right now and I would say girl it's not like worth it like use it like I don't think it's worth it I think I would personally hold off to buy more like CBD products and stuff like that until there are more studies done and more research you know I mean it's not regulated by a third party so it doesn't confirm how much you're actually getting you might be buying one thousand and it might just be five hundred you you don't really know that is my thoughts on vaping CBD that is my personal experience thank you guys so much for watching if you've ever tried CBD CBD Lotion CBD Baum CBD anything comment down below and let me know your experience thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time [Music]", "fvCQ-DDJT6c": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna show you our latest addition to the honey stick lineup of product which is our flavor max disposable oil vape pen now this little pen we just put up on the site yesterday is not a rechargeable it doesn't have a cartridge and a battery that's separate it's a one-piece little oil tank that you're gonna fill up you're gonna use and then once it's all done out of battery then you're gonna toss it and either get a rechargeable one or purchase some more if you really like this pen now we put just because the disposable doesn't necessarily mean that it's a it lacks on any features we really wanted this one to have nice creamy solid hits but to really have the big box flavor taste that you could get out of some of our other more high-dollar cartridges so in case if you want to travel or you're just not one of those people who wants to maintain your vape pens this is gonna be a good little go-to for you now let's jump into some of the specs so as I mentioned before the battery is not rechargeable also it is an auto draw so it doesn't have a push button it's gonna be activated by your airflow so in order to turn it on or to vape you're just gonna inhale and when it's on it's to be indicated right around the foot here of the vaporizer with a hyper white LED since we have a light here I don't know how well you're gonna see it but I'll inhale on it just to show you guys oh that was coil do not dry inhale these vaporizers otherwise you will taste nothing so first of all when you get your your your oil vape pen it is going to come in a little transporter tube like this and we're gonna jump into some of the technical specs so if they come in here be it is a glass tank glass mouthpiece okay you're gonna want to keep this little plastic tube in order to transport going out on the town going out for the night you want a small little vape pen you don't want to carry around your stay-at-home unit or you're scared you might get a little reckless and you might lose it these little pens are good for those occasions so this pen will slide right into this little plastic piece as you'll see we have a rubber stopper and as long as you push it all the way down past all of the three ribs it also has a little seal right there which will plug into the mouthpiece it'll be flush to also additionally seal your kit case of ends up upside down you won't em even I don't recommend storing it upside down that you won't end up with any leakage that comes out or goes into your pocket so let's jump into technical specs so we have here is a 280 mAh battery which the battery should last through the entire duration of you vaping the tank and also have a little extra spare I don't recommend after you've run through a full tank to refill it because you could get snagged before you run through the second tank and have some oil left over in there which you don't want to happen so fill this thing up give it to you have a 280 milliamp power battery which is a good capacity yeah design-wise you have the honey stick insignia there with the hexagons you know give you guys a little better view just to the bottom base there and then that's all followed up by a glass pyrex glass reservoir so just give me a nice high-quality topped off with blue seal gaskets at the top and at the bottoms to make sure that you are not leaking and it also has for purity not a wide bore but a nicely cutout glass mouthpiece now this tank is a ceramic heater it is also non-porous so you're gonna have pretty good heat ups on here definitely gonna be flavor oriented with the glass mouthpiece a ceramic heater and also as you saw I had nothing in there and it was still kind of smoky heating up when I inhaled on it so you're gonna get good heat up time and it is a 0.5 mil fill so you're gonna be able fit just about a half a gram in there in terms of orifice holes and how thick a liquid you can put in there these have one point eight millimeter orifice holes so you're still gonna be able get on the thicker end of the spectrum oils in there even if you have minor coagulating in there but with an auto draw you Nicole a ting you do have to know that if it does get solid around the heater or the air holes you might have to take a few little priming puffs and by priming puffs I mean puffs like you would take on a cigar when you were lighting it you know just just very slow don't really inhale just really get the heater going start getting the tank hot and allow the materials to break up so how do you fill this thing let's run right through it this glass mouthpiece you're gonna grab the metal collar right here you're gonna twist counterclockwise and again twist gently because you have gasket that goes up here then you also have gaskets on the mouthpiece you want to make sure that you keep those in place you also have a seal gasket on the very top collar there and you just place it down gently then you would take your CBD juice or syringe and you want to carefully and slowly inject up that went a little fast inject around the sides and let the liquids work their way down to the bottom now one thing that you definitely do not want to do is you don't want to force the syringe in there don't make it so that you move the center post at all you know don't have it bounce off the center post the liquids because then you could run a risk of leaking around the outside of the tank really wait for it to settle before putting any more in okay now you see I might have actually overfilled it just a hair I got right to the brim I'm waiting for it to kind of settle in a little bit because I don't want it to leak so I'm gonna give it a couple seconds here kind of blow on it a little bit now I'm gonna slowly and gently make sure you leave the gaskets in place slowly and gently twist now clockwise tank then when I feel it you're gonna feel it when you get it tight it's gonna get a pretty good little seal there now you are all filled up and then what you do is I would just leave it let it settle for about ten minutes and then you can start to vape on here and like I said what this is not a rechargeable unit it's not something I would be in the practice of refilling but then once you vaped it through you're pretty much ready for a new unit so if you like this and several other cool items for a little flavor max pen check us out on WWV pani stay calm subscribe to our youtube channel here comment to us like us

been getting lots of questions lots of emails about delta 8 and i thought instead of responding to them all individually i'll just create a 5 minute video talking about everything delta 8 hopefully this answers all of your questions and then some so first of all let's get right into it what is delta nine i assure you that you do know delta nine also known as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is thc thc that cannabinoid responsible for the psychoactive effect of cannabis so what is delta 8 well delta 8 is another of the 150 cannabinoids found inside of the plant it is native to the cannabis flower but it is made in fractions of a percentage it is not as abundant as delta 9 thc when you look at the molecular structure of delta 8 and delta 9 you will see that they are very very similar however when you consume them you realize that they're different for one thing delta 8 has a much lower psychotropic potency than delta 9. now notice i did not say it's not psychoactive when you give this to a patient it is very likely that they will feel a change it will feel an effect so we like to say that delta h has its own unique feeling it feels like what delta eight feels like it's hard to compare it to delta nine but patients wanna know what does it feel like so how can we describe that feeling of delta eight this is how i talk about it when i consume delta 8 i feel clear-headed i am lucid thinking i can concentrate i am focused and in the sound i am not foggy i don't have any paranoid thoughts i'm not impaired however i still have that general feeling of wellness that i have when i use cannabis i feel calm at peace content i might feel it from the ice down depending on how much of it i take but i just have all the benefits without that mental impairments right so who likes delta eight when i worked at the shop i remember golfers love delta aids cyclists hikers caregivers people who need to be productive for part of their day which is a lot of people it's important to realize that people who like delta 9 and people who like delta 8 can be the same person the what your patient is looking for on a friday night is not necessarily the same thing he or she is looking for on a wednesday morning to get ready for finals or to get ready for work so it's really a great tool for everybody's belt what are some of the medicinal benefits that you may experience when you use delta eight for one thing you may feel a release intention and anxiety it could be a sleep aid it could even protect your brain cells but one thing i hear overwhelmingly from butt tenders and patients alike is that it is great for nausea anytime you hear a patient talk about nausea not being able to eat think delta eight grab that delta eight for that you could be changing somebody's quality of life i'm not gonna get into it here but i really encourage you to check out a study from hebrew university in jerusalem israel where they studied the effects of delta 8 on pediatric patients who were suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy now let's talk about the item 9 labs delta 8 line we have cartridges and capsules the capsules are 14 milligrams and they come in a pack of 10 so that's 140 milligrams of delta 8. the cartridges come in c cell half gram or 500 milligram cartridges they're about 80 to 85 percent delta eight thc and they come in a wide variety of flavors we just released three new flavors that's cool breeze strawberry fields and lychee lychee is my favorite but they're all really really great these are complex flavors that taste really well you don't get tired of them they don't make they're not like overly sweet they have a lot of depth to them i'm really impressed with them if you have tried delta a talk about it with your peers um remember just really remember delta eight and nausea that is such an important thing all right well that's all i'm close to the five minutes so i'm gonna leave it at that keep sending me your emails keep sending me your questions i will post my email at the end of this video you guys have a great day okay bye bye", "OkiLenpSPl0": "but i mean come on bro these are pretty sexy like just objectively even if you got all four you were just ripping it it'd be pretty hot what's up everybody youtube's been really busting my balls about their community guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks hey what up before we start this cart video usually the cart videos just don't have a lot of smoke in the air there's not a lot of you know big smoke so we got to fix that with this cheers everybody [Music] oh my god i'm doing exactly what i needed all righty man i think that's exactly the type of hit that we needed to start out a video you know when you get a hit like that the video is just going to start out good man but this video is not about the dab so i guess in a way it kind of is man we're talking about some cards today some really [ __ ] expensive cards it's the whole reason why you clicked on this video so listen you've probably if you're especially in a medicinal state medicinal only state you've probably gone to a dispensary and seen some absolute [ __ ] cart prices like forty dollars for a half gram of distilling which is like mind blowing like 80 gram of [ __ ] [ __ ] like get out of here bro then you get the live resin carts which can be around the exact same [ __ ] prices like 40 on the half gram it really depends on where you live because california i mean i've seen live resin carts go for 35 on the full gram i've seen some [ __ ] dislike for 40 i've seen dislike for like 10 15 so it's just it's just really depending on where you live but these bad boys right here these pod tones made straight in la are 55 wait for it not for a half gram they're 55 for a 0.3 i don't know if you can see it right there on the bottom net weight 300 milligrams so usually it's a thousand milligrams for a gram cart and uh if you were to buy three of these which i only bought two because i'm not a [ __ ] maniac if you were to buy three of these bad boys it would be 160 dollars and you still wouldn't get a full grand you'd get point one off it's like someone skimped you on a full gram cart now of course if we're gonna buy all this [ __ ] we gotta have a sponsor for the video you guys know who the sponsor is i absolutely [ __ ] love them they've been with us every single month for over a year now adam and eve just the wonderful people over there listen man this this [ __ ] and sex kind of go right hand in hand i'm not gonna lie what's better than getting baked and getting late it's like my motto damn you can get 50 off any single item and free shipping if you use my code con and uh obviously you guys are using that [ __ ] because they're coming back so often so listen shout out to you guys that are using it maybe you guys even use it consistently i bet you i have several people that watch every month and get reminded and they're like oh yeah i need my monthly sex toy you [ __ ] freaks i like that [ __ ] shout out to you guys that's awesome like i said for guys girls anything in between just anything you know what i mean whatever you're into they have it i promise go check them out it's good stuff maybe a little birthday is coming up or something you know it's just surprising anyway these little bad boys right here these expensive ass [ __ ] i haven't even opened this one yet so i'm excited to try this one out these are made from rosin like i said so if you don't know if you need the breakdown explanation of live resin rosin difference and all that i made an in-depth video right here it's like 20 minutes pretty [ __ ] long but if you want like the one minute breakdown distillate which is probably like 80 or 90 of what you see on the market it's a majority of what you see is made from a process of just nasty like crude cannabis oil pretty much and it goes through a distillation process over and over like two three times and then you eventually get a very pure thc extract it's like upwards of 99 just thc but the only problem with that is just like distilled water there's nothing else that comes along with that like extracted thc it just gets you high there's no flavor behind it there's no profile there's no nothing it's just like distilled water it's it's like it's flat zero so if your distillate cart tastes like something it was most likely added terpenes after there's artificial terpenes are there's actual live resin terpenes but even if you add live resin terps to the distillate it's still a distillate cart a lot of brands will try to get away with that they'll have like on their packaging it'll be like live resin terpenes like a little small little thing it's like it's 90 distillate which is not awful i just personally don't like smoking it now live resin on the other hand is a lot different live resin comes from actual cannabis plants so as soon as the cannabis plant is grown instead of hanging in drying it gets frozen and then you extract it through a variety of like butane processes or gas processes whatever then you get an extract at the end of it which unlike distillate already has all the plant profile in it because you just got it from the full plant so you don't have to worry about adding any [ __ ] after any cutting agents or you have to worry about any of that because it's the it's the full cannabis profile plant and i love it because if you get like a gorilla glue live resin cart it is so much different than getting a gorilla glue distillate cart with like just some gorilla glue terpenes after it's just it doesn't taste the same it's not even close to the same and the feeling that's the main thing the feeling is way different because you don't get what is called the entourage effect entourage effect is pretty much all the cannabinoids working together to make you feel a certain way so you know you necessarily don't get higher off a bong rip but you get like feeling good off of a boundary but when you take a fat rip of a distillate cart like yeah you get higher but it's like not the same you don't feel like the body high it's just like a real like a it's like an unclean high you feel like you're just getting too much thc and not enough for something else which is exactly why i don't like it but this [ __ ] on the other hand rosin which i know i think specifically people in the northwest have known about rosin cars forever because when i was there for hemp fest i think 2019 i saw several people several people came up to me like homies and fans and [ __ ] and they're like yo bro like smoke this rosin card like it's all we smoke out here and i was like what i was like damn that's a lit like even cali's not even on the rosin card set heavy if they are they're taxed as [ __ ] as you can see ridiculous rosin is a whole other game than live resin because live resin you need a gas or some type of extraction kind of like butane propane whatever method to get it out rosin you use very simple heat and pressure you literally get a nug you put it between two plates you can even put it between a hair [ __ ] dresser a hair dryer or whatever i've seen a lot of people do that on youtube and [ __ ] crazy i don't know if i'd recommend that but you squeeze it out at a very specific temperature and a whole bunch of juices come out and those juices are what you're smoking so you don't need any sort of additive or any sort of extraction really like crazy method it's very like simple it's almost primitive in a way you just [ __ ] squeeze it juice come out monkey smoke you know that's really what it is it's [ __ ] dope you get the whole plant profile with it without needing any circus sometimes if you're not a very good extractor with live resin you know there's a lot of companies that are qualified a lot of individuals that are qualified but sometimes if you're doing black market shade there's a lot of live resin out there that like these are you know amateur extractors and the live resin isn't as tasty and there's too much butane in there there's too much like they didn't extract it right it's just there's a lot of [ __ ] that can go wrong obviously like i said this [ __ ] even an ape could do it's very primitive you get two hot rocks and just squish a [ __ ] nug in between and i'm pretty sure that's how they were making like juices and [ __ ] back in the day like it's the same method but we just smoke it this one that we're smoking right now it says notes of chocolate berries and citrus with a relaxing body high and a positive mood lift it's a little bit cap i'm not gonna lie i don't know about the chocolate but i do taste the berries and citrus i'm not gonna lie pod toads are made from full spectrum whole plant rosin extracted from premium flowers for a natural and delicious entourage effect like i was saying entourage effect beautiful i like how they said that on there no added flavors whatsoever 100 cannabis rosin made in los angeles good [ __ ] right there so here's the craziest thing that i think is on this whole package right here it says it uses over 1 8 of buds for this i listen dude i'm not a professional i'm not trying to like tell any brand what they should and shouldn't do but like damn that's crazy dude i feel like i got two rosin presses right over there i can show you i'm literally just whipping around real quick those two bad boys right there i can get like a grandma rosin off of an eighth probably but then again i have to like extract it once more to be able to put it in the cart so maybe that's about right maybe they are using some real gas in these bad boys it better be for 55 a goddamn point three they better be man technically if there's an eighth of buds in here you're paying for like a 55 eighth which is very in line i guess with other la prices indoor prices top shelf prices whatever you want to call it this one that i'm opening right now oh [ __ ] there's some uh try them all it says up fun chill and dream see that's another thing that i'm not exactly too sure about i i'm not too big of a fan of when carts say that stuff for like because it's very it's marketed towards like the karen that just walks into the dispensary for the first time and she's like i just want something to have me chill and it's like they sell these to them in the beverly hills or like west [ __ ] hollywood and then they're like all right yeah like i'll pay that amount but i feel like to a connoisseur that really enjoys rosin that enjoys like because i feel like they're not getting appreciated they're the type to be like well why would i spend 55 or 50 or whatever the price is on 300 milligrams when i could spend like 20 on this a thousand milligrams this one over here they don't understand the difference so it's like it's a very weird marketing i'd say it's a weird grab right here i will say that pod tones i think you should uh put some strains on here i think it'll be a lot more desirable to the people that love rosin you know i mean that are very interested in the extraction game in the actual cannabis profile and trying to get a specific flavor specific you know terpene profile so i mean i don't know hey i'm not trying to tell anyone how to run their uh their little shming skis right here but hey this one's called the dream i will say that these are [ __ ] these are it when it comes to just the profile of them this is one of my favorite looking disposables maybe ever it probably is the shape the feel and i'm not sure if it's plastic it might be a little bit metal like maybe metal coated or something aluminum coated it's fire though it feels good in the hand it's like cold to the touch you know what i mean you know sometimes you get the plastic ones and it's like whatever it i'm a big fan of build quality sex appeal i'll call it a lot of people call it box of peel or look a peel but i mean come on bro these are pretty sexy like just objectively even if you got all four you were just ripping it it'd be pretty hot [Music] i will say that after a couple days though they do get they do expect you to finish in a couple days which i respect they're expecting you to chief on these because they do get clogged if you're not chiefing them like very consistently that was very nice let's get a little dream rip in and let's read the description i like if you can read the description and then taste it at the same time i feel like it just enhances some things maybe it's a little bit of a placebo but who knows let's see a perfumey floral bouquet that okay did i say that right like a bouquet of flowers i might be tweaking that delivers full body tension release perfect for letting it all go at the end of the day so it's a indica i imagine some sort of strain very heavy maybe a little og i will say that the airflow off a fresh pod is [ __ ] way better than this man like i said they expect you to [ __ ] go through these very fast dope it tastes good i like it i mean [ __ ] i don't know if i'd spend another 55 on the other one i feel like at this point if i already have half of them might as well go for the other half some point right i don't know they're expensive as [ __ ] though are they worth it probably not i don't know i feel like the common theme on my channel is just like i'm a [ __ ] cheap bastard man that's that's the whole point of the channel damn near if you were to just watch every video you'd be like damn this [ __ ] doesn't like spending money at all like dude i don't know i just feel like 55 for a point three like come on like they're dope and everything but like i said you guys in the northwest you guys been smoking rosin for a fat minute man a hot minute you guys have been smoking rosin cars you can probably get a gram i think even in the northeast i've seen some people in boston a little massachusetts gang where are you at man i have seen some people with rosin cars over there you're probably getting full grams of rosin what 50 or 60. come on a third of rosin a third of a gram for 55. i said a third of a rosin what the [ __ ] does that mean it has been the whole video we haven't taken a blinker which i think is pretty [ __ ] up so without further ado let's do a little blinky action man cheers everybody oh yeah wow that was a very short blinker but i feel like that was an appropriate amount of smoke like that was that was a solid blinker bro i've definitely taken 10 second blinkers that didn't have that much vapor i would have to rate them if i had to give them out of 10 including the price including everything within the packaging the feel the the high that you give with it the flavors taste but mainly the price with mind i'd have to give these a solid seven and a half like uh as the price gets cheaper i feel like the stars would go up you know i'm just that much of a [ __ ] cheap bastard whatever that's my final review on these bad boys listen you guys are [ __ ] crazy i appreciate you oh they're just knocked over no i knocked over my torch we're all right shout out to um i don't know you guys i don't know i was gonna say shout out to adam and eve there you go for the sponsor i was like i didn't get sent these but these are pretty cool cool little somethings man i just always like pointing out making videos on expensive ass things when i see them out in the cannabis world i got a 120 gram of rosin that i'm about to make a video on like in a few days that shit's [ __ ] like like what why is it so expensive like it doesn't even make sense dude so thank you guys for watching so much i appreciate you make sure to check out adam and eve make sure to check out the code you know use the code get sent off check out these if you're a big baller if you like some rosin carts if you're in the northwest just laugh at people on the california coast that are smoking [ __ ] these for a ridiculous price you know the crazy thing is i always go to a certain dyspo in west hollywood that has these and they [ __ ] are sold out of them all the time so that means they're hot on the shelves people are buying them i wonder what the market is man i'd be very interested anyone at pod tones watch this video check them out i kind of i didn't [ __ ] on it i gave it a seven and a half it's a good score right there be very interested in knowing more about the company like just your demographics and stuff if you had a breakdown of this i wonder if it's rosin enthusiasts or like karen's and moms that are just trying to get high and [ __ ] i don't know i love you guys thanks for being here thanks for chilling i'll see you very very soon on the next video and uh i'll stop slacking i promise i love you see you soon you", "dp_QBj3BtEk": "yeah rickum Rick and Morty babe dude oh look I said I know more crazy stuff man cuz like I'm acting kind of crazy so Luke this guy Rick morning a vape Oh even vape like that you know I don't like do all this like with the nicotine stuff well either way we're gonna try this out though alright look at my beard Oh neckbeard lookin ass all right let me in that [ __ ] hi man that she hit my [ __ ] lung strongest [ __ ] alright I'm gonna take one more this for you to buy nyan do this [ __ ] like normally alright hey man don't [ __ ] with nicotine good for that y'all that do you know it's not that bad maybe the way I read it just seven out of ten it's alright you know just want to make a quick video for the channel", "cjZVHP0gKdU": "hey guys cam here today we're going to work on this uh epson xp 4100 and uh i'm going to work from warehouse today so if you hear uh background sound sounds like a forklift it probably is a forklift i'm going to show you firstly how to disable absence automatic update and then we're going to disable the absence ink tracking system so the epson will display a full tank of ink no matter what and then i'm going to show you how to refill the original epson cartridge as a bonus i'll show you how to make a transparent epson cartridge which is a highly uh requested if you haven't installed the driver i suggest you go to epson.com and install driver be covered be careful where you go you can see this first one is epson.com that's correct one however after that drivers absent.com printersme.com absent that that probably is is correct and the apps and scan scanner driver.com those all spam website iprint help whatever so make sure you go to absent.com there are two things that are available one is called driver and utilities another thing is called the firmware never ever download or update the firmware from absence so do not download this go download the driver and utilities in the process of installing absent will trick you to update your firmware so i'm going to go step by step show you how to disable those i just love this this file contains everything epson needs that's funny it's a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos vitamins and minerals everything the body needs it doesn't have everything the body needs okay let's get everything apps and needs uncheck the firewall option research specific participation no during the installation it will ask you if you want to update a firmware make sure you click no for the registration is up to you i usually just disclose it after absence done go to printer and scanner find the xp 4100 click manage then printing preferences and then go to the maintenance tab and click the software update you have to light it uh checking for the update but do not install any of those go to auto update settings instead in there you're going to find a bunch of printers and you can turn all of them to never and that's i highly just test and this is the proper way to install the apps driver if you already have the apps driver installed and you should do the last step to disable the auto update even if you disable it and a couple days later you're going to get a prop up randomly on your on your windows screen it asks you if you want to update the printer set disable automatic update and that should be all the tricks for the second step we're going to turn off the absence inktracking chip so you can use any cartridges and you can use any kind of ink you want and apps and will not bother you anymore there are a couple companies doing this uh however the one i trust is called inkchip.net uh it's dotnetnut.com and so you go to ink chip that and go to soft which means software and you're going to see a four columns the first one give you a video how to turn your printer into a firmware update mode and then okay then you can download the firmware and try it out so so if you cannot uh get the second step working do not pay do not go back go ahead buy it and uh and adjust reverses to the your old firmware that you can get from epson or you can restart your printer so no harm is done so if the second step is successful you get a new firmware in then you'll need to pay you need to get this action activation software and then you can pay to get a key and you use that key to unlock your absence and if if you like a read and here's the instruction on the fourth column so first thing is we're going to go ahead and download the 4100 and by the way today's method is the same thing for some method for for all those models so we're going to click download and when it's downloading let's turn the printer into firmware update mode so you can we're going to put this firmware in so we're going to turn the power off and next step easier if you have your wife or girlfriend or both to help you so you can hold your right hand like this press the the triangle button hold it down and then the down arrow and hold it down and then there's a stretch hold the left body left arrow button then press the power button just hold it until you see the uh the blue screen is on now the firmware is downloaded so to uncompress it you can use uh winrar or you can use a 7-zip i put the link in the description so you can click and get those freewares make sure to not go to spam site and those should be free free softwares so this is uncompressed go in there and uh we're going to run this firmware 4100 window is going to ask you if you want to uh allow this unknown publisher to make changes click yes uh before you do this make sure you have the usb cable plugged in to the to the computer and you go to uh step one step two agree step three four and five uh you should see your printer list here uh in this instance your printer is not listed a couple things to check first first one is of course you need to plug in your usb cord and the second one is before you plug it in you have to install the installer you install the driver that we covered earlier so for this case i installed the driver already plugging the usb but i still cannot see it see the printer next you can try is uninstalled i used uh printer sometimes you have 20 printers uh that could be a problem yes i installed the xp 4100 driver data you just installed a couple minutes ago i uninstalled that one too to put this printer window back to normal mode just unplug the printer and plug it back see no crime is done so we go back to epson website we're going to use a different driver not this combo just go to drivers and uh we're going to use a disk driver so this one will be only the driver about 33 megabytes uh this driver is a little bit different so when you open it up the window will just allows you to select the printer and set as default printer that's the only choice you have and just just select that one say okay sometimes there's another selection box underneath the default printer it says automatic update firmware and do not do not select that box okay now put the printer back to the firmware update mode connect the usb cable and let's try again see that works so here's the printer and it will show up status as unknown and just click start after this run to 100 you can just click finish close this however you uh your printer will stay keep updating so just leave the printer on go out to get a cup of coffee sometime it takes like 10 15 minutes okay when you see have a couple lines tags like this and uh you can either unplug the power and or like press press a button let me remember which button press so home no uh or is it done though yes oh it's the ok button now we can go back to the inkjet.net and click soft and download the license program i also going to buy one key for the printer you only need this one key per lifetimes and once you bought it is yours and if you somehow you override the firmware you can recover it this is the license program the printer hasn't shown up yet because i did not plug in usb record yet let me plug in the usb cord and click refresh here's the printer and click the active online and then now it's time to put in the license key without important this is the recover key you want to copy all those texts and save somewhere to recover just repeat the firmware update then click paste then click recover you need to restart the printer after after the license you can see all the ink levels are full even i don't have any cartridges in the printer at all now let's think what kind of cartridge we're going to use uh either we use the oem cartridge from epson or we got uh those refillable transparent cartridge from ebay and i suggest use the oem cartridge if you look at this side you can see there is a serious air channels and multiple chambers and then there is a you can see the bigger one thing that's a one-way damper that's prevent the air flow backwards and remove the air bubbles so there's lots of engineering in it you know there's a team of engineers making it a state of art all the third-party cartridges it looked like somebody made in the garage and they're really they're fuel chambers and there's only one filter and that's it you got this big chunk of ink pushing down on the printhead and eventually there could be some linking problem can i use the starter cartridge in the initial light engine cartridges can i use the xl cartridge can i use the regular card dress yes yes yes yes and uh they all exactly the same the initialization cartridge or start cartridge that come with the printer will end up with i and uh and excel will have excel they are exactly the same they're same cartridge can i use a different color cartridge no you cannot and if you see the groove here they're different so you cannot plug in the magenta into a into a cyan slot then can i plug in the cyan from a different model yes they're exactly the same the groove is the same so it doesn't matter which cartridge module by they're the same so if you have cartridge already and more power to you if you do not have a cartridge yet go on the ebay search for absent empty cartridges there are people who haven't watched my video so they sell their empty cartridges and they don't know how to refill them and you'll be looking for those numbers and uh do not buy like a 14 or do not buy like a ao2 and this ammo to look good and uh there are 32 of them for 16 what a deal the only advantage of the third party cartridges are they're transparent you can see how much ink in there however absent one way is you can use a scale see how much of wheat so you you're sure how much ink in there and secondly there's a little window underneath the cartridge and you can just put it horizontally and see if there's ink in there or not so this one is empty and you can see the one on the far left is full and the yellow one is half empty or almost empty and if you stay on in this video i'm going to show you how to make this cartridge totally transparent so you'll have no reason to use third-party cartridges oh be careful the 252 xl is a fat one so your printer will not fit a fat one in there so buy a regular 252. for the ink you can use uh pigment ink you can use dye ink you can use sublimation ink or whatever ink you want just go to bchtechnologies.com ink for printers and for epson you can use any of those three the difference is if you make a t-shirt you you're going to make a you can use the sublimation link otherwise do not buy sublimation ink and you can use dye ink that's cheaper and if you stay with absinthe what apps and use is go you can go oh app or pygmy ink that yeah that's different um in a nutshell and uh the pigment you only use it if you want you print out to be a waterproof if you just print the regular documents and the dye ink is fine i mean it's really up to you what you want do not email me about hey i got this printer model what kind of ink i use they're compatible for all apps and printers if you have apps and those three inks you can use them uh except the submission in case for making t-shirts um so today i'm going to use a sublimation ink we have a four bottle of sublimation ink in its holders and uh syringes needles i'm going to put those accessory link above and in this description so you can pick it up if you need it here's a collection of random cartridges i bought from from ebay how about this i'm going to print the i'm going to pick up one cartridge from each model so there'll be four cartridges from four different models also one is excel and one is a starter cartridge and let's try this you'll need a one three millimeter drill get it from hardware store or bch technology.com i'm gonna put a link above and also in the description also you need a four plugs and those l-shaped plugs so ink syringe drill and three millimeter plugs and take a cartridge and see the space between the the model number and uh just drill in the middle there you're gonna drill through the first layer and the window fill is through give it two more turns and just pull it out very fast so in this way the debris will come out with the drill after you drill through the first hole and put a drill in and just smooth out the edge a little bit make it make the round and then you go drill through the second layer make sure you drill through two layers use the needle and just test it make sure that the needle can go through the second layer and that's why you'll need a long needle now you can feel the syringe with 10 mil ink uh if if this is repeating refill i suggest you go with eight mil uh because there are you might already have two males in there so the maximum i'll do is 10 mil if you got a squeegee bottles with the needles and squeezing bottles you just squeeze like a third of ink in there and make sure you need or go through the second hole before you push so your needle is resting on the bottom or second hole and now you start refilling it if you only drill one layer you can only fill about six meal but this way you can feel 10 meals and you either see the milk the nut milk you either see the ink coming up or you you finish your 10 meal i also have a piece of paper towel nearby so you can clean the top after you fill in the ink and now you can put a plug in and uh just twist it a little bit twist push twist push and they'll get in smoothly sort of and you're done your printer will always show full-time ink so now it's up to your eyes to look to see how much you get in there you can say underneath the little window see how much engine in there or you can just use a scale as a bonus i'm going to show you how to make a transparent cartridge flip it over and use a finger or just a dig underneath the uh the small window so you can see it's kind of like a you can pull it up and uh you're not going to put this cover back so just tear it off now we're going to remove the top layer of this black membrane you'll need a very sharp almost like a brand new razor blade and just go horizontally scratching the the corner make sure you scratch from this corner because if you if you p pierce through you can always use a piece of tape to tape it and just scratch scratch you're going to need a good like a three four minutes so i'm going to fast forward now this fast forward 20 times and eventually you're going to see a little bit of tiny part coming up and i cannot do this with a glove so i took the glove off so use your finger pick it up and start hearing it this is really fun and the satisfying thing to do maybe use your razor as put it underneath to help you a little bit and start picking it up and once you pick it up just start hearing it you're gonna try it a couple times before you actually get a hold of a big chunk that you can leave it up once you get a hold of that part and the rest is pretty easy just try to pull continuously and stretch it strategically and this part is so satisfying and i'm going to mute just let you enjoy oh that piece of breaker part and then if you really wanted to you can just keep working on this little part this is so satisfying i mean this is the bad thing i enjoy to do next time we'll have a party uh bring a couple of those cartridges and show it to your friends and this will be a check magnet trust me okay after you get all four of them ready and i can put them in the printer for a spin make sure you go to maintenance then can't change cartridges and when you do the cartridge replacement the printer gonna move to the replay replacement position now you can put your uh piece of art in there i'll put another check by going to the maintenance and uh another check and if you you've come out this blank or missing couple of pixels and just repeat it repeat uh not repeat just go maintenance uh printhead cleaning and uh like a return repeater cleaning until you get a perfect natural check so you can see first one is blank so i go to head cleaning absence hot cleaning is not that efficient sometimes i have to repeat uh up to like a night 10 times before i get a really good another check also sometimes the nozzle checker become worse before it gets better so don't worry if you get the second and that another check is worse than the first one so just keep doing it until you get perfect i'll review the printer every maybe 200 pages you can take a room of paper dividing the half and so every half you check the ink level and you think level is low and you just fill it full i hope you enjoyed this video visit us at www technologies.com or locally at

very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "4REI6eE4bxI": "what's up guys this is d with three kings today we're going to be reviewing the o.penvape which is a buttonless open source

and work the unit most of the time you find that the caregivers that they'll have these prefilled cartridges available in 150 250 and 500 milligram prefilled cartridges for you to buy and most of the time when you buy one or two of them you'll get the battery and the charger itself for free and if not you get it for a pretty decent price of about 10 or 15 bucks so the battery itself is a two hundred and eighty million for unit it's got a pen stylus attachment at the end which you can use for your touchscreen devices like your phones or tablets it's got a 510 threading in here it is a slimmer design like I said like an old-school ecig arete attachment and used in conjunction with this cartomizer for a heavy smoker like myself it usually goes at least three to four days for me so the cartridges they've got a bottom burning coil here on the side with the oil and on the back here where you can see how it's split down the side it's basically that's where it breathes and where you're going to get the intake is going to pull your vapor up to the mouthpiece for you the coils right in here in the center of this underneath the oil and you just thread that in like any basic 510 attachment now you can remove these mouthpieces because I'm not a big fan of these glycol basis because they irritate my throat and they just lower the THC level and the solution overall so most of the time once I've used up the contents of one of these or just dumped it out I pull the mouthpiece off here take the little rubber stopper off and then you can put your own oil in there and you're good to go so we'll go ahead and put the unit together and show you guys what it looks like we'll take a ripoff of it and you can check out the vapor alright so here's the open fully assembled like I said it's about a five and a quarter lengths go ahead and show you what the papers like on this unit so you can get a pretty decent ripoff of the open overall I'm going to give it a four out of ten though because I'm not a fan of the glycol mixes like I said not only does the glycol tend to irritate and burn my throat but there's some testing going on here in Colorado that shows that at 250 milliliter cartridge of these tested for 23% active THC cannabinoids which is basically a joke you could find the same amount of THC in about two grams of regular flour that's grown from your local caregiver or dispensary so essentially what you're doing is you're paying 120 dollars for a full gram of this and getting ripped off but like I said you can pop off the mouthpiece here take off the little rubber stopper and once the contents that this has been used up you can just put your own hash oil in there and you're good to go so four out of ten just because of the sleek design of it the way that the battery lasts and I do like these cartomizers although you want to try to stay away from these glycol mixes and if you have to use a glycol base try to find a vegetable glycol of somebody that'll make a vegetable glycol in your area I'm sure you can find someone that's doing that right now so thanks for checking out the o.penvape hope you found the review helpful informative check out more of our three kings vape reviews here on YouTube and I'm D thanks guys keep checking back you're going to have some stuff for you next week see you then", "uFbd5n2YqzQ": "real quick before this video starts only only 2.8 of my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another cartridge uh this time another glow um i've done a bunch of these before but i like to do kind of an update anytime they get new packaging or new flavors or anything like that and uh this time we we have both new packaging well the packaging is very similar to how it used to be but instead of the gold shininess it's the rainbow speckled shininess so you know huge update in that department uh you can pause that there if you'd like to read any of that but this is the martian muffins flavor and they released probably like 10 to 15 new flavors not too long ago um and i am honestly a huge fan you can see i've been chiefing on this one a bit um this is an indica one uh 1.0 g cannabis oil one milliliter cartridge if you've never heard of glow extracts uh they're i guess black market company as in they don't they're not sold in dispensaries but they are definitely one of the uh most well-known out of any of them and they're obviously doing something they're obviously doing all right because they've been pushing out a lot of new flavors um i reviewed the they did the sour patch kids and the um the vanilla wafers and what was the other one oh they did the watermelon one and the the kobe one so they're doing something and they they do their best to eliminate fakes well fakes fakes of this company i guess they recently added um they have cards in every single box that shows what flavors are in there and they they're constantly changing their packaging changing it up a little bit just to make it a lot more difficult for any fakes to be manufactured their instagram right there glow extracts they also have a snapchat but um yeah this martian muffin one is delicious i love it it's it does have it has a little bit of fruitiness but it's mostly just like it reminds me of a lot a lot of the um the wafers not the vanilla wafers the other one where it's it's very uh like sweet but not in a candy way in like a in like a muffin way you know what i mean but i'm definitely a big fan of this flavor probably my favorite or second favorite glow card i've tried so far the gushers is delicious i love the gushers um but this is definitely a close second let's take the card out here if you have never tried glow extracts definitely a cheap alternative to a dispensary cart on the bottom there the cali logo glow extracts got rubber tips and rubber bottoms i've and i've never really had any like issues with these carts like leaking or anything like that so they're very consistent that's my you know that's what i like most about this company um so yeah definitely check it out um i got a bunch i got so many videos like this on my channel i also have a gaming channel which i will link in the description uh but uh yeah that's pretty much it guys i hope you enjoy i everyone's staying safe out there staying inside hopefully if you're able to and uh yeah later", "MkSRS7QzefY": "i'm going to show you a fake glow cart versus a real glow cart real packaging fake packaging super big 10 of these are not going to fit in when a box meant for these that one came in this box 10 came in here see 10 cow this is also old boxes these are still floating around so just because your box looks like this doesn't mean it's fake just means it's old these are the new boxes new carts boxes i believe the cartridge itself is still the same good that's the carts this was a real glue cart i finished it a while ago and i just kept it in the box and didn't ever think i'd make a video like this um but my buddy actually got this one and i told him to get me one because i wanted to make this video he didn't charge me i mean he did charge me for it but i'm just going to give him a real cart instead it's showing the difference um charge me 20 bucks for it i normally pay about or two for these p 22 20 anywhere between 22 and 25 is what i pay for these right now it's not the best price but hey it works um this is the real one i'm sorry i mean i paid 22 to 25 for these these are the real ones not that um but as you can see there's something still in here it's a gold oil gold amber color oil all of them are they're all like this this is a fake one that should crystal clear they're not crystal clear but i don't know what the [ __ ] that is it's some weird [ __ ] and that's how it is when you turn it upside down it moves slow this is still like i think this is delta eight tell you the truth i think somebody stuck delta eight in a fake glow card because it's harsh as [ __ ] and it like gives you this weird like hi i only took a couple hits off this thing and try it out to see what the [ __ ] it was uh because my buddy was smoking them and uh they didn't do [ __ ] to him yet but you know i don't know it's one of those weird things i wouldn't i'm not going to smoke this [ __ ] i'm throwing this out after this video actually i'm going to keep it just for like you know future references never know make another video um but yeah that's another thing you can tell the fake ones you see the way it says glow right there for one that looks [ __ ] weird why does it look like that on the metal piece right here that shouldn't even be there um that's how you that's a dead giveaway your card's fake all cards that have that are fake glue has never done that has a california logo on it but that's that doesn't matter so this is another thing i was going to address right there it says c cell on there but that's fake because these aren't real c cells these are some shitty [ __ ] um but they've done that that's the fake one this is the real one and the real one it looks like it's actually like engraved in there like laser etched not engraved but it's like done with the laser that almost looks like yellow paint yeah this almost looks like yellow paint so not that is um the middle of the rod right here in the middle is super thick on this one too you can notice that this this metal rod right here is thicker than this one is see and if you say oh it's because the liquid is magnifying it or something i will show you another part of glows where's my [ __ ] battery yet give me one second guys this is my cart that i'm using right now you see [ __ ] is hella thicker still now rose isn't the best oil around you know you're still gonna get bubbles and everything those are just air bubbles something don't move when you turn it upside down so you know these aren't real clothes you can piece it oh it looks there's all those bubbles in it they're [ __ ] air bubbles you don't know [ __ ] don't talk [ __ ] did you see this i got [ __ ] boxes you know i don't have to worry about getting fakes i buy them by the box bro there's another [ __ ] box somewhere here by the box you know i'm able to [ __ ] track my [ __ ] i don't know about y'all i have like my plugs going directly from these vendors these glow vendors so we know a thing or two about the you know good carts for the price you know for a street car here in my state cost about 130 prior to tax for a gram car of distillate distill it not no special rso anything like that just distill it and i couldn't imagine paying more than 20 25 bucks for one of these things dude i just can't so yeah um you want to see you know be like oh that's a fake card still i'll [ __ ] pop open another one for you guys i glow even sent me this is one of their older masks they have new ones out now you can tell i put it through the machine they also sent me a hoodie but that [ __ ] was too small that is an xl i wear like [ __ ] 3x bro i'm [ __ ] 6'2 and 250 260 pounds dude come on help me out here [ __ ] i can't try and do this one [ __ ] hand in my ass here we go there's a fresh cart right here this is the uh cereal milk i wonder if that strains supposed to be sold anyways is this like one of those terpenes i don't know i kind of think i low-key just think it's different terpenes they add to their distillates so it gives it its flavor because it's kind of artificial you know it's an artificial flavor and for sure but um yeah no it's just uh cards are pretty you know all the same say glow extracts right there as you see california they come with seals the glow um then there's a couple's likes they should all always come in a box like this now these are the updated packaging like i said there's still these around because like let's just say i know a thing or two about them and they were still making you get some of these when you ordered the new ones and uh yeah you got the new ones you had to get some of these oh sorry i just got a message i was reading that and uh you had to order some of the older ones obviously get the new ones so they wouldn't be stuck with a [ __ ] ton of old ones you know nobody wants that and they wanted to get their supply out so that's what happened with that um besides that happy smoking you know i hope you really enjoy it um you know i'm just trying to help you guys not get ripped off like i said don't buy these big-ass boxes what's in a big-ass box where the cart doesn't fit snuggly like these carts fit snugly in here you know they move around a little bit but not much in here the cart's going to move around like [ __ ] crazy it's just not it's going to move you know that's a dead giveaway [Music] they don't even make these anymore but this is the same one of that box this one was the real one oh yeah this is another thing i know look towards this little extracts right here and right here says glow extracts there's a space between there shouldn't be that so yeah look out there guys don't get ripped off please", "nclj5B0c7UA": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video but it's gonna be different from the other first three this is a part for don't get me wrong but this idea of this video I'm just gonna be reacting to what your opinions are on fake cartridges well not you guys specifically but the people of Reddit I'm going to go to the fake cartridge subreddit and we're just gonna read down the list from there I don't know how long it's gonna be but I'm just gonna you know read down the list and we're gonna have on my phone as well and on the screen we're gonna put it right here so you guys could you know follow along with me and yeah hopefully this makes a very very eye-opening video educational video because as much as I want to do videos on this I feel like if I dedicate a single video to a single cartridge I'm gonna be doing this for what a long-ass time you know and what better way than to just react to the fake cartridge subreddit and then see what kind of fake cartridges are in the streets from all over the country because like I said reddit is one of the best sources when it comes to fake cartridges and what you're actually you know ingesting or consuming so please just be aware of that I'll post the link in the bottom description below if you guys want to check out the subreddit but very very good information and you know with fake cartridges you know I've said it in the past three videos they can be good but they can also be bad and it's not worth the risk so if I can make these videos and spread awareness whenever I can then you know I'll do my best to do so so before we start this video let me take a hit this is a blooms farm cartridge so you can see it's pretty much about to be done a little bit of black stuff down there I was [Music] all right let's start this [ __ ] video so fake cartridge stop ready like I said it's gonna be on the side right here so you can go along with me this is actually gonna be a different video than I usually do but hopefully still enjoyable and hopefully still can keep people safe from smoking Fake cartridges yourself go right here we go it's recording all right fake cartridges will sit right here and we're gonna open it in to Reddit okay all right so we're just gonna go down the list okay first I see y'all sleeping on South cart okay I've done a video on south cart before generally most of the time I would say a hundred percent of the time actually if they're using copyrighted cartoon characters on their [ __ ] it's fake okay you cannot do that in a legal system where you can just take someone's likeness and put it on a cartridge just I seen the the Tiger king in a cartridge too so you know if you have if you have any questions on that it's no those are fake okay you know and obviously there could be some good ones because like I said they're fakes so that means if the good oil producers start selling them that means this is gonna be good or you know there's obviously there's a chance for it to be good there's a chance for it to be bad and it's really not worth the risk especially if you're in the legal state if you're in a legal state the only reason you'd probably buying legal hearts is because you're underage but like if you're getting a legal cart you might as well pay like someone that's older to get a real cart I mean it's hard to stop underage person from smoking so at least get him to be smoking some good [ __ ] you know like the real legit [ __ ] not some fake ass self corpse okay so let's go down Lions breath it says in reference my elbows he texts a lion's breath your carts have legalized results for why none our fate call the lab companies to verify ok glow or is this glow extract GE extracts not gonna lie looks like a really good cart like they even have it on the class I don't know but that looks like a legit cart the oil looks a little bit it looks dark and bubbly and runny so I don't know about that let's go down to white guys anyone heard of this company new to the page it's runny doesn't have a bad taste I'm still going to say it's fake I'm 101 percent its fake like what the hell two white guys come on like another thing is another red flag is if it has weird names you know two white guys come on like I'm not saying like legit companies can't have bad names you know but most of the time it's usually gonna be fake jetties jetties as though I've actually tried jetties before on my second channel it was alright it wasn't the best it wasn't that good but it wasn't bad I just remember the taste being like like a black licorice but that could be just because the stream that I chose was black licorice taste or something I don't know but I believe it was distillate so okay lemon oh she look like chapstick the one in the middle looks like chapstick like a chapstick container with a [ __ ] cartridge on top of it and that's dizzy I don't know if that's a live resident it's really dark Hey hell no Lily you just struck oil in the cart that's the oil red liquid and astiz e-card so with carts I don't know cuz mines legit too but you can definitely see some uh some darkness towards the outside of the hole so you know with carts sometimes like the oil darkens overuse I don't know about this one this is he kind of looks all [ __ ] up to be honest but yet sometimes the oil gets a little bit darker on the bottom most of time it's dis looks that do that that is big Chiefs may woods cookies aren't promoting them so my other video with Big Chief extracts apparently there are some legit ones and there are some fake ones you know I'm saying if you are a big Chiefs fan just know and be aware of the differences you know because the fakes do not look like the real ones but then again just be careful because sometimes fakes can look real legit as well so just be careful hey guys [Music] that's not even a carte Bleue Hogman or something another Muhammed I mean that looks pretty legit yeah I guess but then again who knows my friend asked me if you should buy that does not look like no raw barn this [ __ ] cap is about to be off [ __ ] that my homie makes these himself with supposed terms and wife so how does it look to you I suppose for you doesn't to me took off the cab it drops into a gaming hit weird almost like a big juice I mean pretty much answer this [ __ ] right there but like I said guys if you're taking off the cap and just drop some in there but that means you shits very liquidy and runny and that's not oil that you need it or want in a cart it's supposed to be like like a honey that's been in the freezer like the fridge where it's cold but barely moving you know that type of [ __ ] that's crazy Pier one [Music] so that's the thing that answers my question like you know you could be smoking on some fake [ __ ] and it could be good but even if it were bad the long-term effects or the effects might not show up instantly you know it might show up in a month in two months you know in a year you know who knows and it could be permanent so just be careful guys okay choices it comes with two what the [ __ ] is this she look back I mean that's a really cool idea you know two cartridges in one different strains but that straight back looking I should look like it was made in the 90s KRT another some of you guys mentioned KRT cartridges I actually haven't seen it till now from what I've seen it looks pretty legit but then again it looks like the same box type of date baits just a little bit smaller and I don't know I really don't know let's just see their thoughts on it have Quixote's have a shitty reputation as a black-market breadwinners if there was good to hide in the last long and it was a card that I would never buy again definitely not a legit brand I mean pretty much says it right there KRT like with fake cartridges you know they could be KRT they could be diamond boys they could be muhammad's there are gonna be good ones you know I'm saying and it's up to people in the legal states or the people that are actually buying it using them to be able to tell the difference okay you know I can make these videos and tell you it's fake but at the end of the day I really can't stop you from doing what you want you know I can only tell you and if you decide to listen you decide to listen but you know you're your own man just be smarter with your choices you know I'm saying cuz buying anything on the streets is no bueno you know people don't buy street freaking you know you're gonna buy us like a homemade camera from some guy you know no you're gonna buy a camera from Best Buy because it's a legit company you know I'm saying like you're gonna go by Canon instead of Fanning from this guy's garage you know that's just the facts you know if you buy but this is just an example obviously no invite you know you know homemade cameras or whatever but it's cut it's the same thing you know obviously a fake camera won't affect your health in any way oh just affect your bank but you know when you're buying this fake camera isn't there gonna be something along the in your head thinking like this is gonna break within a week you know it's the same concept here you know just be careful you know okay Lions breath is it okay for me to is it normal for our Lions breath to be clear I mean Kelly by the way another like I don't underst like obviously maybe he's probably underage you know but when you're underage everyone knows someone of age you know saying and if you're buying a fake cartridges you - and you're underage you might as well be underage and smoking real cartridges so get someone to buy your real cartridge if you're in Cali because Cali is like there's dispensaries everywhere you can look left you could look right there's a dispensary I think we're gonna end the video here I think it's long enough and I've proven my point with fake cartridges just be aware you know I'm saying and it's if I can make these videos and help and save someone from buying some of this [ __ ] then my job here is done hopefully you guys enjoyed the video like it if you enjoyed it or something subscribe [Music] [Music] [Music]", "0dGf5pK_PAA": "you know guys what is up we are back but we are in my car because I have to go to [ __ ] school on a Friday which is my second day which makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a

drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit

otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm

later guys I'll see you all in the next one deuces", "C_jsQRBh6Nw": "what is up everybody welcome back to stoner vibes today we're here and I'm gonna review this [ __ ] new pen that I just got it's called the arrow pro to stop the whole [ __ ] pen doesn't even look that much like look like a pen looks like some kind of like my grandparents have diabetes they have today you know like prick themselves with like this whooping it looks like one of those that's what it looks like to me because it looks like that just like a little cylinder has a little tip it is press a button phone like I need we'll just fix them so they could check the blood and [ __ ] but yeah this is the arrow Pro it's super interesting honestly was it was weird they had a promotion there where I was where I was at the dispensary I was at but here is here's the package it came in the package it came in yeah it's arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technologies specifically designed for Peter oils deliver superior performance and taste and this has like a one-year warranty included cartridges were sold separately yeah this is it's pretty cool it seems like it's made in China but yeah the arrow pro it's crazy it has no lights or anything it has a light - like in the cake when it's charging and when it's done charging but that's pretty much it like it is really I'm gonna take a pull from so you guys could see it doesn't light up or anything but here we go cheers everybody I hope you got a smoke come on tapping mom whatever you guys are doing as long as he doesn't getting high here with me but here we go everybody Cheers [Music] anything rips that's the thing that's the thing I like about it if it's it's pretty good but the thing that I think is the craziest is that this thing vibrates when you hit it like it's not like and then like an aggressive vibration it's just you know you just feel you know it just you know it vibrates it to let you know that you're taking a hit since it has no but no lights no buttons or anything like that you need to know I'm getting it so it has a culture that literally just vibrates and [ __ ] so I think that's cool I mean I guess I have in comparison I have this desire here it's a BAM oh that's a sticker that I put on there but it's strong and I just picked this up yesterday comparing these cuz I mean I guess we could compare them this one you know it lights up it has a little lights at the bottom this is a regular state everybody know is dizzy they just came out with the big sticky which is something I want to review so if you guys want to see that video hit that like down there comment below and I'll [ __ ] make a video on that but give me like this real quick cheers everybody we got some strong Hannah right here I really like this runner runner is really good it kind of tastes like smoothie but well yeah we got this ones I mean I like it it's pretty cool only there's there's downsides to it so I'll do the pros and cons on it so this right here the pros and cons of this is the pros know it's stuffy as [ __ ] like this this is all it is charges to the bottom right there yes we got this right here charging for it super stealthy it's like magnetic and it's like not even like that's all nother thing right there I guess we could compare and I mean it doesn't really make a difference but this one right here you know it's not gonna fall off it won't fall off but this one like it takes it takes quite force to like you know it's a pretty strong magnet is what I'm saying so your cartridges I'm just gonna slip off or anything what else I think honestly those are the only pros you know it oh it doesn't have a light so I mean that's why I think it's so [ __ ] stuffy because you could just hit this anywhere in the dark in the movies like and I don't think anybody would know if you just blow it down and [ __ ] and you just you know goes to hit or something but yeah this is pretty cool I like it the only the piece of these are the cons because it only comes in half grams so you only gonna be able to get this review and I didn't be able to get a full Brasco the other con is at the 40 bucks each [ __ ] halftime cartridge that's another Angus it's another Pro that it's Inc it's pretty good [ __ ] weed like I don't know where where I left the bag I [Music] threw it away but the bag where this comes in doesn't even come in like a little case or anything it just comes in a bag it just gives you although they has CBD has THC all that and the percentages the tested percent you know will they tested it out and and that's another Pro you know it's it's a good quality oil it's a good quality cartridge everything's good quality it's just that it's 40 bucks for a half gram where I could buy heavy hitters for like 40 bucks and that's a foreground I could buy a freaking brass knuckles 45 program but that's over here in Cali and where I live so I don't know exactly what what it's lucky for you to stick your in but you know I think it's not worth it for the money but that they had a deal where if you buy the cartridge you get the battery for free and the battery is 40 bucks itself so that's like easily 80 bucks just to get a half gram cartridge and abetik so it's kind of cool it comes with this case oh my god like it's a pretty cool case I bet you charge as well but has a little station where you want to put your battery you can put you up your cartridges right there it's pretty cool the display came with like a bunch of them so like display her all of them fall and I kind of thought you know it was gonna come like that with all of them like an empty empty ones just there you know but it didn't it just came with it just came with the one the battery in the and the charger and some like you know little papers inside there that were like their their brand and I think some instructions but I mean I honestly done them take a look at the instructions I think the structures are still in the box but I'll take a look at them later but yeah this is a it's it's it's pretty [ __ ] interesting it looks honestly looks weird little ass [ __ ] fanny let's see the size difference this dizzy isn't over smart [Music] honest I prefer this dizzy it's it's cheaper that could also mean cheaper quality oil I'm not sure I think it's pretty good but then again these these are 65 for full graph so it's still you're still paying good amount the only thing is that it get pays off with the with the battery because the battery is only 20 bucks so but yeah that's that's that's my review on this you know I really like that it's it's kind of small it really looks it's kind of weird so like I'm not sure if it's like it like at first I'm seeing I don't know if it's uh if it's just like a big pen like I don't even it is a kind of doesn't even look like a cannabis fan other than the color I [ __ ] I mean it comes with red once it comes with orange ones and the color I got maybe that might give away its sweet cuz it's a green but other than that I don't think anybody would know it doesn't light up like if you want to hit in the dark you're not gonna you're not gonna see a little little light but it does vibrate so it gets a good full as well like the air feels pretty good a little bit more restricted than the than the stiff but you know it's still good it gets it gets a good hit but yeah I mean compared to this dizzy or anything like that I mean I first noticed it just based on price because this dizzy is just pretty pretty simple pretty basic you know with the light at the bottom same a same charge as this one but yeah I probably wouldn't buy this one I probably not gonna buy another cartridge of this one unless like I don't know I'm gonna buy a cartridge for my friend I mean a battery for my friends so like if they have that deal again I probably just buy a cartridge and just give my friend the battery but I mean I don't know I just it's just I probably won't buy this anymore I just probably just gonna keep on use buying these or the heavy hitters but I just lost my battery so I haven't been able to get a 5-10 thread on hydrogen water so I don't know but I believe you guys it's it's it's been fun but I'm taking last hit from both of these [ __ ] until this one blinks I don't know he's never gonna stop but [ __ ] go cheers everybody I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys keep tuning in like subscribe follow me on Instagram all that jazz but peace everybody Cheers [Music] Oh God Cheers [Music]", "nEOBxmpmasM": "damn son where'd you find this key don't [Music] hi guys okay so today I'm gonna be reviewing another cartridge right this cartridge it's like really like if you can find this cartridge I'll totally like recommend it I have a bunch of acting right now cuz out for job today it's Jen wait wait is it Gen X tech or Jenny I think it's Gen X tackle screen 1/2 today it's gelato July as you can see right there and it is a hybrid on the side it has and we're minutes on the other side he has their Instagram and on the back it has like the percentages and I'll take a video of these of a close-up to take a hit just started a little video or the review I'm gonna take it in the highest temperature just did it go alright guys cuz we have to post it out and post in a long time I need a lower it says today it's a hybrid but I feel like it's an indica dominant because you can take lightly want it to hit you good but if you keep using a little bit more you're gonna feel like oh like the weight on your body a lot more and it's just gonna make you a lot more sleepy but everyone's like two or three hits you know it's like in your head and then your body but then you do kinda feel like a little bit sleepy which is which is why I think it's an indica because it does make you feel a little bit more sleepy rather than giving like energy and this is the oil by the way I didn't show you and I've used it for like four days and I've shared with my brother but yeah they'll call it the quality they're like the oil it does and the flavor and that's also what I liked about them like the box it says everything it says like the THC percentage and this one has 79% I'm gonna take another flavor I'm gonna take another hit just so I can describe the flavor this is a mid temperature and in the lowest temperature you can get the best like flavor I am using the yolk oh Jesus I like these are these these are the flavors like how he describes a flavor ah or turpan analysis or whatever it says right there are you gonna do Fitch's it does does taste citrus earthy a little bit sweetness it's all the way high it's like super high and it's like super sweet horrible horrible horrible it's not really like that natural tasty nor piney so it doesn't taste piney doesn't taste like dank so if you want to find that flavor July no it's not the one for you I'm gonna take another boxing when you open it this first of all is sealed so if it's not sealed someone has opened it already so it has to be sealed and then when you open it it comes like in the tube in a plastic tube saw this tip in us I think here's Eric Heinz video he says he said that sometimes when like he's like his friends give him I hate it I look like whatever they have you test the product or whatever it by doing a little ghost inhale and to see it like if it's hard hard your new smell isn't it and I've done that too and it's [ __ ] facts like sometimes you take it you take a needle and a pin and you do it a ghost an arrow and you feel like like super harsh and like I keep this idea for you and I'm into that [ __ ] it's pretty [ __ ] smooth of course like these a really high potency just list so it is gonna be like a little bit hard if you take like a super strong course I'm gonna take a 10 second hit for you [ __ ] that are gonna say why do you take super small dick I'm gonna take a long hand all right later on I'm gonna review this cartridge once this hi I'm saying I want to Cheers [Music]", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "NCi5kzpTtaQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah I can't really I don't really taste anything bro you're alive you know it is the other ones

guys have the best tips for how to clean a grinder please let me know today i'm going to be talking about a question that i really get all the time and the question in general so it can be regarded to delta 8 it can be guarded to hemp cbd whatever is is cbd just reggie is delta 8 just reggie is delta 8 flour just reggie are the effects from delta 8 pins just like reggie are the effects of the delta 8 flower the delta 8 edibles whatever is it just like a reggie feel [Music] and so i kind of want to break down what reggie is to me and then talk about what delta how delta eight thc is like and how cbd is like and then kind of get to my answer of whether i think delta eight thc in cbd is just reggie so in like my vernacular of what reggie is reggie is typically just outdoor grown very low potency marijuana like reggie is like so here in houston for example it is difficult to find like you'd have to go out of your way to go find reggie it is not just sold on the street i've never seen i've never had a dealer try to pass off reggie to me in the last five years if you're paying any type of reasonable price even like thirty dollars an eighth here in houston is still not reggie it might be some like mid but it's going to be like 15 percent thc it's not going to be traditional reggie which is like single digit thc the quality of the flour is typically like 80 stem a lot of leaf and then a little bit of flour which is a big reason why it's such a low percentage thc because a lot of times it's such a low quality flour if any flour on the stem at all and so people break down all of it and roll it all or pack all of it in a bong bowl or pipe bowl or something like that and smoke the whole thing but the percentage of thc in that substance is very small or in whatever you're hitting is very small so that is kind of my definition of reggie a lot of those older like brick weeds that were available early 2000s stuff like that and i know for a lot of people who even may be watching this video because i've lived in the country before and i've seen places where reggie is like prevalent where people are actually like day to day it's not uncommon for people to be smoking reggie and so i have to empathize with that fact i talked about in the live stream last night like the guy i bought um the delta nine flower from last year in houston has like jungle boys like seal packs in the city of houston and for reasonable reasonable prices less than you're going to find in a legal state or in terms of tax and stuff so with that being said to me reggie is just very low percentage thc bud um where most of it a lot of it's going to be stem a lot of it's going to be whatever is thrown into the pack kind of the leaves whatever but not necessarily quality buds so that leads me to what is delta 8 thc flour and cbd flour so cbd flour hemp flour is just obviously people say the cousin of marijuana but less than the 0.3 legal limit all that but it can be indoor grown it can be very very quality buds like the bud structure and the base of delta 8 flour is still hemp so it can be those same bud so the buds are completely they're different like for example one of the things i put into this j which i need to go ahead and pack all the way so i can light it let me find something here we go this plug is always here but let me show you this bud for example after i get this pack got a lighter today so today's joint salad one of the things that i have in there is some of this blueberry cheesecake from five leaf wellness i'm gonna show you some of these buds like this is not what reggie looks like i hope you all can see that this is not what reggie looks like i'll show you this is some of our rocket fuel delta 8 flower on sale now but i'll pull out one of these buds and i did not plan this at all so i'm hoping some of these look decent but these are smaller nugs but if you look at it still like this is not what this is hand trimmed flour this is not what reggie looks like and then we can get to the effect so if we can look first looked at the quality of the buds and next we can get to the effects so i think there's a question actually yesterday in the comments somebody was asking are the delta hate pins just like the effects of smoking reggie absolutely not first off because of the things that reggie a lot of times comprised of like i talked about before which are the stems the leaves all that stuff in my experiences which have been single digit times of smoking reggie um my head hurt every single time like the quality of the smoke was just poor the taste poor the effects afterwards poor the effects during poor it's not what it's not ideal it's not what there are some people that would choose that because that's what they're used to but overall in terms of just quality of butter the exact same way that there are some people who want to choose the very cheapest beer even when they can afford nicer beers because that's what they're used to and i can understand that but that does not mean that that's the highest quality so today i have the rocket fuel mixed in with a little bit of jungle boys mixed in with this blueberry cheesecake from five leaf wellness and it's it's very very nice the smooth smoke there's nothing reggie about the smoke it's relaxing and if we're talking about the effects of cbd versus reggie if i had to choose i can concede of course that reggie will get you a little bit higher because of this the thc in there it's much more thc but in terms of the quality of smoke i'm going to choose this blueberry cheesecake over that every single time in terms of even how i'm going to feel afterwards because this is going to have me relaxed reggie is going to have my head banging this blind video i should have made a long time but this is a question we get all the time but cbd is is delta 8 flower is it just your edgy first off don't take flour the effects are better cbd flour it's more relaxing but reggie will get you higher dose eight flour i would say it depends on the delta eight flour completely because there's so many varying qualities now um but most delta eight flowers i would there's some dots eight flowers i'm like nah that [ __ ] like tastes like reggie it's ad i don't like it i've had some of them like that but overall there's options there are options out there to where the delta 8 flower is nicer than reggie and in the pins the delta 8 pin especially if it's like cannabis derived terpenes even nice smooth botanical derived terpenes still much much better high if you will than reggie and the edibles don't even compare to like the smoking effects of veggie the edibles blow that out of the water so this video will probably put across a few channels but i just want to answer this question because it's a question that's asked often and i don't see a lot of the answers on the internet so to answer your question no reggie and hemp high quality hemp reggie and high quality delta thc products don't compare in my opinion delta thc products are much more superior product they have lab testing you know where it's from um this a lot of the reggie that you get is i mean who knows what's happened to it so in my opinion delta athc is the superior product hemp cbd products quality hemp cbd products are the superior product and that's just really what i wanted to talk about in this video and i kind of wanted to break down why i think so because of the quality of smoke because of the effects that i personally have been left with afterwards and from what i know about reggie i am not a current modern day reggie smoker maybe since the level of high grade cannabis has gone up maybe the bottom like maybe what reggie is now is like 10 thc 10 to 15 thc is now considered reggie that might be the case and i'm just out of the loop in the in the reggie market and that easily could be the case because i just live out in ohio and it was a much higher chance you're going to find some emoji out there than when you're in houston because in houston if somebody sold me reggie i would judge that character because it's like you can find good stuff for such a good price why like you're just being greedy bro like you're actually just being greedy like if you're out in the country or something like that it's like all right that's what the dealer could find this the week this week or whatever for this batch this p whatever he gets but in houston i'd just be like dude could've just been honest with me you're gonna come to me as a man but instead you tried to pass this off as your guest and i don't appreciate it and then in houston if you kind of look at just simple supply and demand principles here in houston we have a city of in the whole metroplex probably four and a half million there's a lot of weed dealers if i had to guess my apartment complex probably has three two to three you know so with that type of economy going with such a large supply of cannabis the price stays pretty steady and pretty steadily low and so if you lose your clientele you could lose them forever because there's so many options such a large supply high demand but the the demand and the supply they match each other pretty good i don't know it's people houston it's like i just can't find it bro no you can find it you haven't asked anybody i know i've just gone off a tangent on this i'm just smoking just hanging out with you guys i am done talking about the reggie and him delta 8 kind of debate i'm kind of just freestyling at this point i'm not really freestyling i did have a couple things i wanted to plan on talking about but as i smoke some more of this this rocket fuel um blueberry cheesecake and jungle voice mixed together i'm it gets harder and harder to stay on track if you will that's probably why it'd be better when sergio comes back because it'll be easier for the videos to kind of stay on track you know i just kind of just kind of just go with the flow you know however i feel that day i kind of just sit out there you know i'll be smoking i'll watch uh i'll watch some [ __ ] i might be on youtube on netflix something i'll be editing and i'd be like you know what now this [ __ ] ain't sitting right at me today oh my bad this [ __ ] is inviting me today and i'll be like and i'll get up immediately and then i'll come in here and that's why like i'm rolling up while i'm on camera with you guys like the shit's organic you know i wasn't planning to talk about the last couple episodes i did you know what i just looked in here saw the lay of the land you know you have a look at a room from a different angle nah it looks different here today or then you sit here you check that you turn the light off i don't know if you guys like artists you like change the lighting a little bit you said a different mood in that hell you know and the angles change and you're like no i have a different type of inspiration but you're in the same space maybe i don't understand what i'm saying but it's kind of just how i feel about stuff it's just you can even with how i've been just combining the thc and cbd and delta 8 products and stuff like that you know like you can just take stuff from different angles and then you can inspire new art but you can kind of stay within the confines of what you've already been doing i don't know if that makes sense but for anybody who's aspiring to grow as a youtuber as an artist finding multiple ways to be creative within the same space with what like the same confines is always a good way to go as an artist appreciate you guys tuning in we are taking pre-orders of 50 milligram edibles they're a very good price if you're interested please hit us up legally lifted tx on instagram and then i'll put the email below don't feel like reciting it try to look at your room from a different angle sometimes maybe you'll get some inspiration appreciate what the [ __ ] i'm just trying to do a little outro and appreciate you guys tuning in with me it's been another episode of cbd hemp library or wherever else this video might be found come back again probably tomorrow for another video maybe even tonight because you never know you're just dropping videos so appreciate it peace [Music]", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on the camera i don't know how the lighting is but yeah hopefully you guys do see that so it's more of like a sauce and we're gonna be hitting it off of my blender so i'm really excited to be going over this sauce because it does taste and smell really good so i'm gonna go ahead and heat up my banger and i'll be back once it's all hot so i'm just waiting for my trip timer to go off but here's the the wax or sauce so it's really saucy and once this timer goes off i'm gonna go ahead and put this on top and we're gonna go ahead and take a rip i'm gonna pick up the rig so you guys can hopefully see the smoke more but yeah i'm just waiting for this timer to go off so i know how hot it is should be any second now like five more seconds and it should be good all right so let's go ahead and give it a hit put on the top now let's go probably have about one more hit okay so that was a really good hit i'm going to take one more and i'm going to end off the video there so i'm going to do again i'm going to heat it up and wait for the timer to go off and number two of the orange cookies cheers so super tasty oh makes me feel really nice oh that was really good so like i said this is the orange cookies like a sauce tastes amazing so i want to thank you guys so much for watching make sure you guys follow my other social medias because i'm really active on there i'm active on here as well but make sure you guys follow the other ones but thank you guys so much for watching make sure you guys leave a like comment subscribe all that and this is ethan signing out peace [Music] you", "6V1gPRAQ_IE": "oh that's good joe i am hot sweaty already ain't nothing i could do but i've been forgetting i'll do all of my cannabis products and uh why not do the timeless battery attached to it is you know say most people know the brand pacific stone but here they are uh pretty sure i'm smoking on pretty sure it's 805 sour it could be forbidden fruit it's funny that something so distinct i guess i'm not a hundred percent sure on because they do taste very differently hey maybe if this battery rips clean and uh allows me to enjoy some terpenes then maybe i can actually know the strain and then i just let y'all know hey this battery is great for like distinguishing like for a person that has multiple cards you know i want to come a little bit to the shade so you can see that it lights up a little bit and so i could maybe stop sweating so much um oh this absolutely rips higher than 3.5 volts if you're looking for like a low uh low temp part this this as well as most automatics in my knowledge aren't actually great for that you'll want like a variable voltage or just maybe like a lower voltage button press battery for that type of experience but yeah i'm pretty sure that's forbidden fruit the my issue now with it is actually the heart not even the battery so i can even maybe try to change the cart so i can review this battery for a little longer have more content and have more feedback for you because i don't really feel like if i don't get enough you know like a satisfactory hit i can't really review it that well and that cart was just uh the oil wasn't lining up with the wick it was tasting burns but i know that has nothing to do with the battery so i'm gonna go back to this shady spot it also helps me to see good this thing i actually can't see the recording at all it's too bright but yeah we're back here okay yeah it's a little puff rock garden usually clog so i guess i kind of have to for a video like this show you what a blinker would be like am i ready though i believe that was a standard 10 seconds oh yeah it's ripping this raw garden beautifully oh oh wow show y'all the view or whatever so you don't need to see my face when i'm suffering i might need some water but i'm i'm crawling it's just it's just a blinker actually i took back-to-back blinkers very very nice i'd raise some pictures right there probably going to use that for the thumbnail if i can wow i'm now i'm just sloppy um i'm i will check just for the [ __ ] sake of this video or should i just think excuse my head right quick yeah yeah all right i got it okay and i hope oh no no it won't work it won't work never mind okay i thought i had a different type of cart so i could show y'all maybe three three different types but that one it actually requires you to be a below like three volts and a taste burn when i use it with this battery well i think none of these damn um battery reviews ends up being one of my longer videos because i'm just out here vibing oh and i guess it's rare that i have this much runtime i'm always low on storage now a little more nature oh i guess my flash is on too i don't think that's really done much but yeah i really like this battery it's held small definitely should have showed y'all what it like came with honestly i think i have in a different video oh my god my hand but yeah my hands have all this like you know just sidewalk concrete take a nice deep breath in okay oh my god well yeah realizing that taylor these blinkers contributing to me sweating too i love this [ __ ] battery um it is a small battery doesn't last the longest but i don't feel like it dies hella quick either so he won like a nice auto draw with some swag it did come with a carrying case that i might actually just add on to the video or not and um you really just like can't go wrong with him like this unless you have specific cartridge that says you cannot exceed like three volts or you know you gotta be on it you gotta rip this live resident cartridge at a lower temperature otherwise this is crazy", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you", "7vpgJ80MjUs": "[Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh", "HMcaV3V8Z1U": "warning the views expressed in this video are not necessarily the views or opinions of the sponsors i am not a doctor or a lawyer always consult experts when making medical decisions i am a legal licensed medical marijuana patient in my state this is an educational video intended for viewers that are 18 or older in today's video we are going to be talking about delta 8 thc specifically hemp derived delta 8 thc is it really legal does it really get you medicated what's the difference between delta 8 and delta 9. i'm going to tell you everything i think that you should know about delta 8 in this video stay tuned [Music] good morning everybody my name is nate and this is nate on cannabis and today we are talking about delta eight i am sure by now you have heard of delta eight over the last six months or so i've seen it everywhere all over the internet and to be honest i've been extremely skeptical i have a lot of history with hemp products and while i do love full spectrum cbd oils and full spectrum hemp products there is a lot of snake oil salesmen out there when it comes to cbd not all cbd and hint products are created equal and even the really good hemp products that i found and there are quite a few while some do a very good job of relaxing you and relieving stress and anxiety none of them get you stoned none of them get you any kind of inebriation there is no intoxicating effect with any hemp product that i've ever tried that is until now i finally broke down and tried some delta eight thc hemp derived delta a thc and my experience was very surprising as a matter of fact the first time i tried these so these are 25 milligrams a piece right i was so skeptical about getting stoned off of a hemp product that i took three of them my normal dose from delta 9 thc is about 20 milligrams that is personally where i like to be i took 75 milligrams of delta 8 and boy howdy there is not a whole lot of difference between these gummies and the gummies that you would get at a dispensary there's a few differences and we're going to talk about it but before we get into the video i have to show a little bit of sponsor love this video is brought to you by elevate holistics elevate holistics is a telehealth clinic offering medical marijuana recommendations right here in missouri and if you need your medical marijuana card and click the link in the description you can get your medical marijuana card for just 75 now that is an affiliate link but i do not get paid if you click that link and sign up elevate holistics is a sponsor on the channel already i already got their money but if you use that link in the description it will save you fifty dollars off the normal 125 card which means you can get it for 75 dollars and saves you a little bit of money so shout out to elevate holistics link in the description all right back to delta eight so so i was talking to the manager of cassfield dispensary a while back charlie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite people now she knows that i suffer from an anxiety disorder and because of that i'm a big fan of edibles gummies they are longer lasting i don't have to medicate every 30 to 45 minutes to keep my anxiety in check i can take one dose now and go off to the depths of walmart which if you have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is insane if you don't have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is probably almost equally as insane so i'm a huge fan of gummies but she has suggested that i try delta eight because gummies are kind of expensive and i'm not always a big fan of being so medicated that you can't function sometimes that's fun i enjoy it occasionally but most of the time i need to find some kind of relief to keep my anxiety and my panic in check so that i can go out into the world and function as a normal human being so i got some of these delta eight gummies from native hemp and then shortly after i got these i was sent some delta eight gummies from top shelf hemp now this has been about two weeks and i've had a chance to really dive into them so what is delta eight thc well it is not much different than delta nine thc which you should already be accustomed to if you consume cannabis or are a medical marijuana patient here in missouri delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the molecular compound that gives us the intoxicating effect when we consume cannabis right so when we smoke or vape it it gives us that intoxicating effect when we eat it in an edible or consume it our liver turns that delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol into 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol which is a complete different compound of itself which gives us a more inebriating effect it lasts longer when you take inedible it's a little bit stronger it doesn't take as much to get you where you need to be so there are already different types of thc that you should be aware of delta 8 is another one now delta 8 is naturally occurring it naturally occurs in cannabis and it is derived from hemp hemp is just a legal definition for marijuana that has less than 0.3 thc in it so all of the delta 8 on the shelves that are being sold in stores is hemp derived it comes from plants with low delta 9 thc and actually low delta 8 thc delta 8 doesn't really grow in abundance in any plant whether it be hemp or marijuana they actually extract it by isolating and extracting cbd and once that cbd is isolated they use a process that includes acids they actually convert that cannabidiol into delta a thc so it comes out cbd then they turn it into delta eight thc and then put it back into products so they cook it into edibles or they put it into a mixture and spray it onto hemp flour or turn it into a distill it into a concentrate like delta eight dabs or delta eight vape carts and because they derive it from actual hemp legally grown him and because delta 8 is not delta 9 it's being sold all across the country but how legal is it actually is it going to stay legal what if you want to sell delta 8 gummies should you be concerned if you possess delta 8 gummies and you're not a medical marijuana patient should you be concerned well to give you a little bit more information on the legality of delta 8 here is matt gunther with the american cannabinoid association congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill you can expect delta 8 products to remain legal till at least 2022. now will the federal government change the farm act that remains to be seen that's if we don't see federal legalization of marijuana between now and then which is still kind of what about urine tests what if you work a job where you're kind of afraid to become a medical marijuana patient because you don't want to fail a urine test or maybe you're on probation and parole and you think well i'm going to take some of these delta 8 hemp gummies that way i don't fail on that urine test when my po pops me are you gonna drop hot the answer is yes you are probably going to drop hot you are going to fail your analysis test if you are taking these gummies because even though its delta hthc going in once your body metabolizes that delta eight once your body metabolizes thc in general it all comes out the same most panel tests are testing for thc metabolites so delta 8 delta 9 doesn't matter what's going in it's all coming out the same so if this is something you're using to get by on that account you might want to rethink your strategy people say that it is the same high without the paranoia or anxiety that some people get from taking edibles or overdoing it when they take edibles it does seem to be a less intense experience so if you are a new patient that wants to try edibles maybe you have a medical marijuana card but you haven't tried any of the brands that are out there yet because you've heard the horror stories of people calling 9-1-1 because they thought they were going to die in some cases they thought they already were dead no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies and once he and his wife were full and high they thought they'd overdosed and called 9-1-1 i think i'm having an overdose of this still as my wife overdose of what marijuana i don't know if they had something in it can you please send rescue did you guys have fever or anything no i'm just i think we're dying how much did you guys have i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead time is going by really really really really slow well instead of being charged parallel sorry instead of being charged the police department let the officer resign his wife was not charged either so far police officials have not commented on the case now how do you follow a story like that those are funny stories but they can be scary so if you're worried about having an experience like that delta 8 is a good intro into it for me personally i started taking delta 8 because i can't afford dispensary prices all the time i just can't most people probably can't either delta 8 is about half the price of delta 9 thc it's actually a little bit less depending on where you get it these 250 milligram packages of native hemp delta 8 are actually only about 25 and if you pick them up at cass fill dispensary you can get them on sale right now for 19 so if you are looking for a good intro into edibles delta 8 is a good place to start in my opinion or if you're like me and just can't afford to hit the dispensary all the time delta a really gets me through in between those dispensary runs or caregiver drops delta 8 is a good replacement or if edibles tend to give you over anxiety or panic attacks like they do some people then delta a might be something that you want to look into for that because it is it is less intense i feel less anxiety less paranoia all of that that they used to advertise delta 8 i truly experienced just at a less potency than you normally would feel so just to recap delta 8 is hemp derived thc it is made from converting cbd into delta a thc it is 100 legal for now it will make you drop on a urine test so if you're on probation parole or you're in a job or that's a problem i wouldn't recommend using this or any other cannabis products but they do work and they do work as described as always this is a subjective opinion this is my personal experience so let me know in the comments have you tried delta 8 products what did you think about it i am becoming a huge fan and with the current price of edibles at the dispensaries these may be my new go-to for quite some time as always thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video give me a like comment or subscribe it really helps me out and if you like the hoodie you can find it on my website cured.tv shop thanks for watching", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "8EyQuIhFzfw": "[Music] oh hi are we on we're on we're on hot mike all right hey thank you for being here what a beautiful day we have it is a beautiful day yeah thank you for noticing that's very good look at it outside i know it's nice we got a whole bank of windows behind james and april yeah so sometimes they catch shadows on us well yes they cast big shadows hey welcome thank you for being here today is going to be a great day uh those of you who are looking for delta dawn i mean delta eight um i was singing delta dawn earlier we were if we were singing together we were i didn't know if you wanted to admit having some no i thought we did what's the flower you have on i know it kind of ages us just brings me back to the the truck the ford truck you know as a kid what do you mean with the little radio on there it's right out there not that far forget it okay okay welcome thank you for being here lots of resources today we've got questions all over the place we've got an r d lab set up you can see it right over my shoulder here and so we'll be migrating over there hopefully without any technical difficulties i think we'll do it it'll be good it'll be great great great hey by the way samuel gorton from ennisburg falls vermont vermont best bourbon yeah oh i re not to diss kentucky bourbons but vermont bourbons are really good samuel he won um uh what did he win t-shirt and some other goodies jared is saying here he won by doing one of our quizzes on linkedin so apparently we have quizzes on linkedin okay all right i wonder what we quizzed i don't know interesting i'll have to find that yeah hey congratulations samuel so check out the quizzes let me know how those are uh we do have live tours cbd jam sessions advanced extraction guides distillate guides calculators mini courses we've got all kinds of resources thank you for being here if this is the first time you're here there's a little red button on the top that will allow you to refresh the screen if for any reason you get frozen just hit refresh it doesn't take you out you don't have to relog in or anything that's really good uh this is a fun and safe place uh there are poll questions so i'm just going back to this bourbon question i think you know we should do a kentucky versus vermont bourbon smackdown oh that would be fun blind taste test i like get to it i do like that now i know you know vermont has some really good rye bourbons that's my preference i like rye bourbon so we'd have to kind of do wheat and rye okay all right that's fine and then do kind of two different flights yeah well that's gonna be a fun afternoon you know we were talking uh before about doing uh like a scotch tasting online yeah and it'd be kind of fun to fun to do that we should also do a scotch bourbon smackdown oh yeah well there's no there's no comparison i thought bourbon would obviously win we just noticed canadian whiskey didn't even make the but see a lot of the vermont rye comes from canadian rye no i like that that whiskers that you have wisers yeah wisers jp wisers uh is really good but that's a canadian whiskey it it is it but it is a bourbon but it comes via vermont it is really good but it is it is a canadian right anyway the more you drink the wiser you get all right we should probably not digress too much i guess what yeah we got a lot of ground recovery this is delta okay questions please introduce yourself um also ask questions no holds barred questions everything is going simple tough join the chat invite your friends there will be a replay there will be a replay there will be a replay all right um today's topic is everything delta eight yeah delta eight delta eight thc you know then you know we've all heard of you know what has happened with delta 9 delta 9 thc dhca we've got all that cbd a those are all kinds of things going pure thc so we've got a lot of things that we're going into on delta eight the questions are here and i'm guessing you have a presentation i do you have any tables i do he's got tables yes shocking i do i have a table and and okay so this is gonna be uh it's gonna be a lot of fun can we get going i think i think we have started okay you have it i thought we lost you there okay here's here's what happened okay so we went into like okay we're gonna make delta eight so we actually made our first delta eight this week kind of cool there's been a lot of buzz about it and uh so i spent monday in the laboratory and bam we got it with a little help from my friend uh shout out to jagger so thanks a lot for that he basically helped me along and i'm like oh do this do this okay whatever and so we're just going to kind of show you our results what we got how we did it it's pretty simple uh i was pretty shocked at how simple it was so i've got these like jager yeah all right not the mick oh that's the mc version different jagger okay let's uh so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go into just a little bit of the presentation and then uh we have a lab little lab set up rather than moving you know into the facility and having a gown up and everything it'd probably take five minutes to get it all done so i just brought the lab here into our studio and uh we'll just kind of i'll show you how i did it so i love that this is a picture uh whenever you say lab just so you know i always get a little worried because i i have this feeling that i'm going to be tasting something oh yes we okay i get a little nervous it just happened it's the anticipation yeah okay sorry go no no no i think we should okay everybody who thinks that we should have my friend randy here um to try out some of this beautiful oh delta eight do we have this that'll be fun because i've got meetings this afternoon do we have the puff bar where is the puff bar okay i i think jared had the puff part can we get that here just make sure i got it okay all right okay all right i don't even know what a puff oh okay okay oh shoot it said it was broke oh okay so okay whatever we we're we're probably not going to try on there maybe you dodged the bullet okay or whatever so look at this beautiful beautiful stuff usually it's it's like crystal white clear but jagger told me hey look uh it doesn't it people don't like to have it like super clear because it it like colorless okay because it doesn't look like real stuff so um if you you know if you process it it like gives you a nice yellow color and we got similar colors it was just a little darker because we didn't have time to distill it all so i'll but i'll show you what we got right over there awesome um so how do i advance this and while you're advancing bowden we agree nice bowden and jeff oh there we go nice okay so here's the outline i'm going to help you guys out because we've got a little bit of material to cover um tell you you know basically show you what delta 8 is from a chemical uh structure purpose i like that you use the delta sign rather than spelling it out that's that's pretty rad yeah you're you must be an analytical chemist phd um is is delta a a newly discovered cannabinoid oh it might work hold the phone what uh no okay so i'll just answer that in one question i won't work no okay uh how do i make delta eight okay we're going to go over that it's going to be pretty simple uh what equipment do i need to make delta eight how do i scale it up and how does delta a to thc affect me and is delta h thc illegal so there's a lot of material here to cover and plus i got a demo so i want to make sure we go quick pretty quick are you going to answer those last two questions before i taste it no all right here we go so oh wow guys this is this is like getting into some true chemistry okay this is great okay this is the structure chemical structure of cbd you can notice there's a couple different things uh that differentiated from thc which is right here you can see there's this there's this fused ring oxygen here right there and um yeah i think that that's basically it that's that's the main difference wow they're probably making some delta eight that's t-rex can you guys hear that okay all right so and then here's delta eight the main difference is that the location of this double bond here you can see that the delta eight and uh is over here it's switched sides it's switched sides right so there's really hardly any difference except for the location of the double bond but it is chemically distinct obviously okay so that's what delta eight thc is pretty simple i'm gonna keep this all really high level uh guys so we're not gonna go into very many details but a lot of people wanna know how to convert their cbd into this molecule and they want to know how to convert their thc that they maybe get out of a remediation process and convert that over to delta h so we're going to kind of go over those two two steps here um look at this okay this is a chromatogram this looks awesome what a chromatogram is is it's a separation technique and this is a hplc separation technique look at this green one right here this is my standard okay so here's um this is t uh cbda this is cbd and then this is cbn this is thc and this is cbc okay so those are my standards look how nice and clean they are they're all nicely separated from each other okay now look this this pink line here is actually some of the delta eight we made yesterday you can see that uh we have some little tiny bit of the probably some of the cbd here or i'm sorry some of the thc here you can see that but you can see there's all kinds of other stuff in there but this big lump here uh basically that's that's delta eight delta eight comes out right here in the in the chromatogram it's not just post thc it's just right after thc yeah so we're going to kind of go in about how to do that and then also we're going to kind of talk a little bit about these other minor products that are um that are produced and what they may be and what you need to know about it so is is is delta new is delta 8 a new phenomenon well it may be a new market phenomenon but it's not really new from the standpoint of people trying to make it out of cbd um this is a paper going back all the way to 1966. well i thought it was from 1400s this goes back all the way to 1481. it was the tetrahedon era yes that's great i'm sorry ah that's good i like that um okay so yeah 1966 so i was six years people have been talking about this um you know this is the machulum paper and he has tons of literature on there so um he was starting to do the same exact thing that i'm going to show you how to do basically you see you take cbd you put it into a vessel you boil it up with some this case he's using ethanol and hdl which is an acid um and it's it's an isomerization reaction that occurs he says it's a catalysis reaction and he does actually use catalysis okay um but uh there's evidence in his other papers that you don't actually have to use the catalytic materials and i'll go through what that is in just a moment but you can see he's using you know just normal chemistry techniques he's got some ether solution and uh yeah and then um he's drying it with some sodium sulfate so that's very very clear so it's really not um you can see it's it's not it's not new at all it's been around for a very very long time and all of the side reactions and side products they're kind of listed at them all in there but they're not um you know each each condition that you have might produce different uh reaction products so you're gonna have to know what those reaction products are before you sell your stuff or make it uh yeah you make it and then you characterize it and then you can sell it you don't want to sell something for example with a bunch of unknowns in it right no so that's that we talk about that all the time we do talk about that all the time and that that's one of the you know kind of the um techie type of bucket chemistry you go on to youtube you watch a video like this one try to go do it and then you try to use it you're you're basically creating um you know you got to look out for residuals number one and then you also got to look out for for other those other side reaction products that you don't know what's in there sure so this is another example of another paper um here he's using p p toluene sulfonic acid okay if you go online and you you read the techie blogs and stuff they're always talking about this a toluene sulfonyl acid right exactly um and you can see in this case it's two hours rather than 18 hours right so so they're using this as a lewis acid kind of catalyst it's in there at a catalytic amount meaning it's it's a very small amount um there was in this paper it just makes it go faster yeah they even talk about yeah it goes faster they even talk about the mechanisms in there if you guys want to go look at that knock yourself out you know um also other different types of uh you know derivatives of thc he's got a lot of a lot of uh you know papers on that i'm not gonna go through this but i'm i'm basically highlighting the fact that this is very old very well known there's you can see here he's using ethanol he's using hydrogen chloride for two hours he's got a different he's again boiling so you can you can kind of just precursor and read the literature and get an idea how to do this well use an acid use a maybe a lewis acid and you boil it up while stirring um and make sure that it's done in the hood so that it's not you know evolving you know evolving acid out into the air and make sure you're wearing gloves and good good ppe with your eyes and stuff so how to make delta hthc this is this is quite simple you dissolve yourself how to make delta eight thc you notice i'm in it the delta the black i did i like that and i even superscripted i did see that that now that is that is actually the way it's supposed to be if you look into all the literature that's the correct nomenclature delta to the eighth power yes i guess so so if you if you don't want to be an ignorant um no i can't what are you saying uh no this is how you normally would uh this is how i normally am is that what you're saying my big stop sign just came up don't say it don't say it okay hot mic i see i do have a filter okay so um rarely okay this so your first step is you dissolve cbd in non-polar organic solvent you can use a lot of different kinds of solvents i'll kind of go over in my table i'll show you some of the different options that you have so a non-polar organic solvent for people like me yeah it just means it's not cold [Laughter] it could be cold or hot but polar uh generally refers thank you for that joke i like that uh it just refers to its polarity so ethanol would be considered a polar solvent uh water would be considered a polar solvent but non-polar would be something like pentane or hexane or something like that just checking yep okay i got your back guys all right and then add uh add the acid whether it's lewis or bronsted-acid which is your acid okay hcl in the case of michelin he's using hdl use p he used the sulfonic acid right lewis branstad yeah yeah thank you sorry um and then um and then you stir in it's pretty critical that you get up to this uh you know 100 degrees celsius and i noticed i didn't superscript that sorry guys and then one to eight feet hours it depends so do you take turns stirring um yeah you know you get no we got a little star bar the stir bar stirs it's an automatic yeah it's an automatic stirrer yeah okay so and then you have a temperature uh hot plate so you can use a stirring hot plate for this and you can do it right on the bench um you know um and then and then basically there's some post-processing steps we tried different types of acids we tried acidic acid formic acid nitric acid we tried um you know like a solid support for the acid using a lewis acid like illumina for example just boiling up the acid in the alumina these are some things that i'll show you in the options it's no problem you get conversion with all of them it's just the fat matter of how fast it is and um how how quickly it goes how fast it is and then what the side products are so that's that's the main thing once you have obviously you have this acidic uh stuff over here um you're gonna have to dry it or neutralize it typically use a sodium bicarbonate you'll get you get two phases and then sometimes people extract with another polar non-volatile or volatile solvent like ether or something like that okay it is not out it's not necessary um you can just it'll wash out some of the color some of the products and things like that if you use a little bit of carbon in here you can also take out some of the color that you see you know in the first slide and then you obviously do testing so you're you're taking this pot right here that that is the stir and you're testing it and then making sure that after you wash it you know you're testing it again and you're testing it you're always testing it now this this final product is going to have delta 9 in it so you thought oh i'm going to use my isolate and go all the way to delta eight it'll be perfect well it's not really because you have to remediate it again right okay so now you're now you're back to thc remediation so and it's never you know it's not never so the conversion is not a hundred percent so you got to make sure that you realize that um actually i think i'm going to skip this this is my little video oh here i got a video here okay and this is my yesterday this is one of my reactions that i was doing this is 50 grams that looks like an automatic stirrer oh oh oh what in the heck okay i don't think it's working it's melting too much hcl and then something happened oh my gosh oh poor doug he's not with us anymore okay all right here i'm gonna i'm gonna go to the next one here and i'm gonna skip this one too because obviously our movies didn't work because i'll show you in real time that's better right yes okay so this is the sources of the raw materials you can use um a delta nine distillate um you know you want to make sure that it's not wind it's fully winterized distilled obviously um a lot of people like to use their isolate delta nine waist you know because you'll get delta nine uh out when you make your isolate cbd crystals okay and you'll have this delta nine and usually people just uh really get rid of it right um they can't sell it as a part of a hemp product obviously that's why they have they have that there so um that's the isolate way of using it um and probably what's gonna happen it's gonna be more complex because you're you know you'll have you'll be you'll be stirring with acid for basically everything right you're stirring it and then everything's reacting that's that's in that slough okay so it's kind of tough to identify what the products are the cleanest way to do it is just to use cbd isolate okay and that's something that you know a lot of people can do also this delta nine fraction would have essentially the same problems as this isolate delta nine waste but you can use this delta nine fraction convert it over to uh c are converted over to delta eight and then use the chromatography again to separate out the delta eight delta nine the stuff that hasn't converted over okay so it's it's pretty simple but again you would be using the same type of thing you'd use some sort of uh acid or lewis lewis acid along with a combination of an acid stirring in a non-polar solvent and you heat it up to 100 degrees to start that's it wow so it's pretty pretty simple um here's some examples of some acid washes and neutralizers that you guys now if you go look at the literature there's this boron trifluoride that's the um you know what mushulum calls a catalyst okay and it is a lewis acid catalyst and basically it's an electron vacuum cleaner it says okay i see electrons there i'm going to suck them up let's take out the electrons yeah that's right so that's all that's also the reason why alumina is is in this list here aluminum is also a lewis acid um and zirconia would work too um and then you have but you you typically would acid wash that so you can buy that all commercially you can acid wash alumina which is basically you're just you're just boiling alumina in in an acid drying it neutralizing the supernatant and then using it you know so that it's delivering the acid this is probably the easiest way to deal with um deal with the process because you're just dealing with a powder rather than a liquid and then you have this p toluene sulfonic acid alumina silicate washed acid and magnesium silicate washed acid uh these uh there's all of these reported in the literature and there's many more yeah like a lot so donald once donald that should answer your question if you've got more questions just let us right but i think that you know you can use um something as simple like we did we got conversion with just acetic acid yeah so we got conversion with hcl we form a gas so we got conversion it's just a matter of how long it took to get there so it's still still is converting gotcha um one thing about um acetic acid in formic acid is that they are soluble in your solvent uh in this case a heck uh alkane which would be heptane or pentane or whatever you guys are using there it would be soluble there so not all of these are soluble i don't know i don't think nitric acid is soluble in an alkane maybe someone can put that in there but i don't think it is but but certainly acetic acid is and you've got to use glacial by the way which is glacial acetic acid which is uh a very highly purified form of 100 and it'll go right into your hair sounds cold yes it's glacial into your polar solvent nonpolar solvent okay um okay so then you have your solvents obviously there have been reports i mean there's some solvents here that you just don't want to use or even have in your laboratory at all okay yeah don't don't don't bring benzene to your laboratory certainly they'll break toluene into your laboratory you know you can use some alkanes um the issue with the alkanes obviously just by the n alkanes which are the more purified form of alkanes you are going to have to worry about residuals okay yeah and because they will have them so when you um go to your laboratory to get your hplcs done to see how pure you are make sure you give a blank to them right any acid you use is going to have something that absorbs in the in the uv and it's going to show up there so i would also take and make sure that you're not just looking at one wavelength have them look at the entire spectrum meaning um have them do a scan from 220 nanometers all the way up into the visible like uh 300 and 350 nanometers okay what that's going to do is 20 to 350. yeah have them scan it they have a certain type of detector that they use for that and that'll allow you to identify if there's more issues associated with uh residuals and things like that so and we have we have several podcasts on you know just basically talking about residuals right we do and so you guys can go back we'll post them in the notes uh you guys can go back and take a look at that excellent um bronstead acids okay these are just acids and like i said we got conversion with just just a straight up acid we got conversion of combinations of acids i think you know in terms of the best one we just uh you know it was acetic acid um with this aluminum acid wash that's was the best one we just washed this uh aluminum acid in the acetic acid and then it worked out real good excellent so richard had a couple of good questions yeah this whole process that we're talking about is this an isomerization process isomerization isomerization yes yes that's that's correct that was close yes all right and then the other question he had a follow-up question is as we're using these does one methodology get a more consistent result than another um you know what i i can't say i have enough experience with it at the moment to really say okay hey this this is better than the other one we got like i said we got a conversion with any of these in it and if you just use these types of acids they're easy to remove um so when you scale up your process you need to think about a couple different things of course the cost of the process the cost of the consumables uh you're going to want to make sure that you have you know an easy way uh conversion wise so you don't have a lot of delta nine right because if you if you're just taking your cbd and you're converting it to delta eight but you have a bunch of delta nine there you're still not able to sell it right okay and that is unlawful that is exactly what happened in our case okay we had delta nine in there um which which then means you would have to um you would have to go and do some chromatography or thc remediation which should we have a another podcast on that you guys can go back and take a look we have a a whole podcast on separations and our pier 99 is a great way to do that absolutely so yeah so that's a couple different things there just so there's no real magic bullet you're always going to produce uh in a boiled acid reaction you're going to produce a whole bunch of different products there and you know you really should know what you're producing before you sell it and you should be my guest kind of have an idea what you're doing or it just sounds dangerous i already thought of that oh yeah look at that beware unknowns and residuals this would be the danger yeah it should be in red yeah okay so let's just kind of let's kind of talk this through guys okay if these are solid supports you you're gonna get residuals and leachables from those solid supports you need to make sure they're pure okay okay when you run your uh when you run your reaction you should run a blank reaction okay this this is just common knowledge you run a bank reaction you you work it up with not no active product and then you shoot it and see what you're you're producing see if you're extracting anything from those materials because not all the materials are equal okay i mean you you can go on to for example okay um a good example of that would be if i took the alkanes and i added you know like a luminol acid wash and i had some carbon in there and i boiled it up you would be extracting lots of benzopyrenes for example those are cancer-causing issues no who wouldn't know that that's what you do you would you would be doing that and the other problem with that obviously would be you if you didn't know what it was you wouldn't test for it you give your consumer i said say hell look at this it's all perfect it's good because you're not testing for it so yeah don't don't don't do that so don't don't be that guy don't be that guy okay same thing with yourself i'll come and bite you in the yeah you wanna you wanna okay i use distilled solvents or distill them you know and take all the water out of them and you can redistill them over like sodium metal is my favorite sodium metal yeah sodium metal i like that yeah with a little liquid nitrogen on the cool trap it sounds like that could be another music jam yeah we could sodium metal we got some sodium metal there okay um yeah it's a little sodium metal there yeah that's all right all right oh yeah yeah we got yeah that this is so this is this is just a little little break from the tables [Music] all right okay that was a little bumper music for the getting uh to the rest of the yes final one we do there will be a replay we have it recorded oh yeah fully fully fully no worries you think yeah okay whatever well eli almost beat me to it okay let's see here demand to see a chromatogram oh you know why i must have been a really good mood when i wrote this okay here's the deal like i can say look this stuff uh i can give you a chromatogram let me show you he's in a good mood right here look at this this is exactly what i'm talking about guys right here wow okay look at delta eight 95 percent oh wow what they didn't show you a chromatograph of all the other crap that was in there okay so you got five percent stuff that could kill you okay basically think about that and then you can see not tested for residual solvents how good is this stuff do you want to have this stuff i mean no way no you know what would be fun it would be fun to just do a show on reading coas yeah oh my gosh we could just do like 30 minutes of oh this is crap side commentary on coast everybody would hate me okay i gotta okay so then let me see here residuals may not be tested okay this is a good example demand to see a chromatogram number one what the heck is in there number two uh residuals may not be tested did they test for the unknowns did they test for the residuals and the leachables may be present those may be solid leachables okay in other words they may be ash content they may be they may be any number of cancer-causing you know residuals do not take a chance you guys got to know what you're doing okay so that's why i say we'll be smart we'll just some bucket chemistry here but just make sure be smart with it yeah and god i agree it's more sodium take a look at this so this is what i'm talking about you see all this stuff in here that we created so we took this beautiful beautiful uh standard it wasn't the standard it was just just beautiful pure cbd it was just this just this peak right here that was all you would see and then we made all that crap by by boiling it in acid okay and i was like wow well that's a lot of junk in there is like what is that oh well it's not even showing up you see it the times are not even showing up so we're not even identifying what the material is you see that so we just magically make it appear well through science yeah science and assets okay here we go this is what i'm talking about guys so so beware buyer beware number one consumer beware number two you got to know what you're doing number three uh it's not a magic bullet number four because you're going to be creating uh thc which is going to have another thc remediation process so this that's the realities of it but but but um uh this is the basic workflow for basically the conversion and once you come up with the right technique uh using the parameters that i've outlined for you and i told you what i thought worked best with the acetic acid and the alumina washed acid um here you have a reaction um this is this is basically just some timings when we did our work we did some timings to try to understand okay what would this look like in terms of you know is this a viable process from the standpoint of you know over uh overbearing amounts of of labor no the answer is no because most of it's machine time so you would just be you would put together a process where you do reaction neutralization solvent removal thc remediation and testing and of course you'd test at every one of these processes here but you want to put this together in a workflow where you didn't have inventory building up in between of course everybody's heard uh my to our talks on operational excellence you can go there's some stuff in the notes you should go take a look at it because it could save your business a lot of money absolutely just just spend an hour with me uh implement the value stream mapping tools understand where you know where your inventory is is falling and you can really save a lot of money and take money off your you know free up money from your balance sheet into cash absolutely that's converting yeah waste or inventory that's sitting there that you don't know what to do convert it into profit right we talk about that all the time yeah that's what we need to do exactly how do you remove cost and part of that is wasteful just sitting in inventory just an inventory you don't know what to do with right right and now convert that into something you can sell yes love it yes yes yes love it and i really appreciate you saying that we talked but it was it was your talk no we did we talked about it we did we did we did we did we did we did yes yes okay so here's the here's the uh workflow for cbd to delta a conversion and you know of course the the testing i would test at every one of these phases so here you of course you because i an analytical chemist of course i want a test tester is going to test the test is going to test yeah that's right we're going to do you got to say it right yeah here we got the reaction we're going to test that we're going to testify the neutralization in fact all the input materials have to be tested okay uh your cbd coming in your delta eight coming in whatever it is like you're gonna test you've got to test that you're gonna say everybody's contest okay you gotta test this me test you test okay we're all happy okay all right what equipment do i need you know a lot of people want to know that inquiring minds want to know oh yeah so um you need to have a stirred reactor with a heater condenser on it and i'll show you acquirer mines we want to have white film evaporator yes the way the only reason you need the white film evaporator is is to is to re reduce the color okay because if you really do it like at a really high temperature above 100 degrees okay you're going to get some really dark extracts i'll show you what that looks like did i bring some no i did not shoot what okay i didn't but i i got some really dark stuff yesterday and you know that might that might be good for a white film so if you have one of those laying around you should use it in this case um and then or you could do a short path too but i'm a known short path hater he is and that has come up several times yes short path later yeah i'm a hater on the short path but okay and then um preparative chromatography obviously um you know that's to get the delta eight delta nine out you know so um we're gonna do probably in a couple weeks maybe three four weeks among put that on our show list of doing a uh separation of delta eight delta nine um on with our p909 okay yeah i love it and then uh the uh hblc for analytical so just just let you know um this is what you the equipment that you pretty much have to have okay yes and heidi we're not trying to be testy what we're doing is we're trying to be a little bit quick so we can get to the lab he's so excited about getting to the lab i can't even tell it's like all this pent up energy okay he's just ready to go man and jason we'd love to do an article on oh yeah yeah we'll do an article how many articles do i i mean i feel like i haven't been writing you are quickly but you are quite prolific but but i haven't been writing a lot lately i know i have a slacker i have a big pile of papers april's got something that she's been working on tables oh jared's got that article you want okay here we go so how does the delta eight affect me okay look anybody can go on i need to study this hold on keep going anybody go online and find this information okay um there's i'm not telling you anything that's not readily available with just a simple google search um uh but um according to some of our actual uh user people that we have um okay uh lightly psychotropic lower potency than delta nine so it's going to have a lesser effect than delta nine um it does interact and metabolize in the same way so it goes it interacts with the same receptors in your body that delta 9 does which is really great so the kind of the mechanism of metabolism is known already and you know the quickest way to get the dose in is obviously an inhale inhalation it kind of bypasses the liver and all of that so um be very very careful obviously the same type of if you're taking it internally through the gut and um you know it'll eventually get to your brain but you in you know but you really need to um make sure you don't overdose okay so typically 10 milligrams per dose that's a that's a typical thc dose so um don't don't do any more than that yeah and we don't really talk about doses but that's about the range of what people yeah take yeah exactly so that's what you want to do there and then is it legal um there's been uh pretty cool we have let me see here oh yeah take a look this is a legal memo that just happened in wisconsin to this uh staff attorney to the yeah it's just a very month ago yeah recently and some people in the state wanted to know okay what the legality is um and this is from their representative and uh this this came from cush.com look at that that's funny but they they had reposted it um but you can see the short answer is that the substance meeting and definition of hemp is legal for purposes of state federal controlled substances laws regardless of its delta a thc concentration that is the beauty of it that's the official of it and that's pretty cool so um the same things you here's what you want to do if you're a hymn producer and you want to kind of get into this and take a look at it first of all avoid the states that are you know hemp is not you know uh looked on favorably or not legal okay oh idaho yes exactly i wasn't going to name the names but i wasn't either but i just was rooting for item that's all i love all their sports teams yes um and then avoid uh states where hemp derived oils are not accepted okay that's a good idea and then hemp drive oils oils are fit for commerce if they are derived from industrial hemp and have less than point three percent delta nine thc okay so um one of the things that i you know i was talking to our general counsel about this and we were just kind of going through some scenarios no we just kind of going through okay the scenario would be okay what if uh you know you have a you have a legally tethered product and then you put it out into the marketplace it has delta8 but it's derived from its derived and somehow you get busted yeah you're gonna have uh you you're gonna you know i don't know it it's gonna be a lot of money basically to uh you know to try to get out of that okay that it's legal yeah you're gonna have to especially with the chromatograms that i was showing you hang on let's go back up to that okay okay see this is so this thc if you have if you don't get a nice clear super separation right and uh you have a little bit of thc in there you don't really know how much it is okay that's something you need to think about so get all of your thc out if you're gonna do it just make sure you get all the thc up i don't know i'm the best thing i'm just cautioning people just don't bring your chromatograph with you whenever you use it well yeah just put it in the back of your car and then when you get stopped no no officer this is actually delta nine and see here's the vlog here you can just hand them that memo from the state of wisconsin here's my chromatograph and you can run it right there that's right yeah run it like yeah yeah that's that's weird okay anyway so that's uh that's that do you have a cup i can use [Laughter] how to measure delta eight okay guys this is really super simple delta a comes out right here here's thc intel day comes out right here so um this is a 70 uh 70 30 water group that's not a gradient it's just a isocratic phase i usually use point one uh formic acid in both of these phases you just run it straight out on a reverse phase column with hplc and it'll you'll get a separation so um and you'll be able to get more and more selectivity between the isomers of delta eight and delta nine um just by uh just by decreasing this amount so you go 60 but you see i was too impatient i actually want a two minute run instead of a four minute run i had to wait four minutes to get those results you were impatient oh man oh oh the other thing i want to tell you i can't even imagine okay you see this line right here okay there's a there's a huge peak that comes out like at minute 10 and a half okay really so i don't know what i have no idea i have no idea we're that means we're doing a field trip someday he's going to figure that out take a look at this guys i mean you just want to make sure that you have you understand what the unknowns are oh sure that's about it so okay um be smart i'm just going to show you a quick demo it's not going to be let's go um and then we can get into some of your questions and we can talk more about it but yeah we'll do a quick demo and show you how i did this all right oh my gosh this is awesome can you hear me okay yeah okay so this is like uh rogue rogue chemistry right can you guys get uh can you guys get a pan on this right here okay there we are okay there we are okay now we're cooking okay by the way this is a nice little piece of equipment um so this is one of the things you're going to need to do use for your little chemistry experiment here um this is called a uh well it's just a stir stir plate with a heater on it what's nice about this one is you can set the temperature that you want the process and it's got this little probe here okay and it's nice because it'll it'll always keep that temperature about what you want okay so here i have um cbd this is a isolate okay so i'm just gonna pour that in here this is exactly what i did guys it's not not very hard okay this is heptane so i just poured that heptane in there awesome okay i just splash around see look at that i'm going to start to uh yeah basically this is what i did super simple um this is some of my uh acid washed uh alumina that i did aluminium uh that i did right here so i would pour that in there and i'm putting it about about uh 14 to 20 by weight okay so uh yeah so just keep that in mind guys and then here i have a little acid uh little acid that i'm putting there okay and it's pretty good now this is not a volatile acid one thing is yeah which means is that we're not gonna we don't we can't actually smell it but obviously um you know if you're gonna use a volatile acid like acetic acid you're gonna heat it up to a hundred degrees celsius it's gonna come off so you're going to want to do this in a hood in a hood in the hood is where you're going to want to do this so and that's not wearing a hoodie no no that that is in like in a hood you know walk-in hood it's it's spinning yeah venting hood the venting hood okay so then all i do now is i as i change this here to 100 degrees watch out for that there here randy and i'm going to go ahead and do that i'm going to turn up this heat i'm going to turn this on like that it's at 100 degrees okay it's not going to heat up now i just set my timer for you know maybe three hours and then this will turn color like it'll turn this color in fact right here is that it yeah this is it i made this is yesterday you can see it's got um you see how it's it's kind of um it's got uh it's it's got a heptane in it so i haven't removed all the solvent from it yet but when you take the heptane out you need a rotavap or a fractron or something like that to do that then then then this stuff will all come to a like an oil so that's what that is so it's really simple guys but you're gonna get some delta nine in there and uh you know that's basically it notice it's got a little bit of yellow right there so that is it now i also showed you this once you remember i put that alumina in there so those are solid okay and you want to be able to basically filter all of that out so this is just a simple buchner funnel with a um you know with a vacuum on it and a sidearm so sidearm and then you have uh you have like a little adapter here this is a ceramic uh buchner funnel and then a filter paper okay if you were doing this at large scale of course you use a drain droid for that and then drain droid would be perfect for for that kind of purpose but um i think we got it i mean that's how simple it is guys it's really not really not that difficult and this is just to make a one-off batch make a one-off that's try it yeah you can send in the sample you can send the sample to us we'll run it for you um but but if you do that i'm gonna be looking for all of the uh unknowns i'm gonna tell you hey you got a lot of unknowns in there and things like that so that that's i'm gonna turn this off now and uh go back to our original position okay so um as we go through there sorry for that that was kind of fun actually we we had a little bit of a technical stuff uh here usually we do this right at the lab we were talking about doing it in in the lab itself um but here here here we are all right bam bam okay here we go all right so mike up hey okay now it's working i thought that was awesome oh yeah now and so this is a one-off uh and if somebody wanted to do this what would they how much would it cost us for that little setup there oh you got you got maybe uh 1200 he had the 1200 you got maybe one two three thousand three thousand bucks something like that three thousand dollars you can do some one-off yeah delta eight yeah if you're gonna you might have like a lot of people might have the um you know hot plate already they might have a vacuum pump already they might have a little bit and you can repurpose all that yeah right i think so so i i think that that's good what um if you want to do this at high scale at scale yeah do you have slides on that or is that something we can just talk about yeah we can just talk about that i mean oh okay so if you're gonna do um you know multi-kilos per time you're gonna need to have a large um you know reactor um which is a 50 liter reactor that's a stirred reactor that has a heater cooler on it okay and also uh has a um could you get that hooked up for him okay why are you worried about my arms no i just i just he's worried about me look at that first time for everything you know maybe we should get these things on a little a little stand that goes right here no these are more fun i don't know okay i was able to boom you i didn't i didn't hit you i thought about it but okay i didn't um yeah yeah so oh the acid is acetic acid guys uh that's a yep and uh no it wasn't sulfuric we didn't use any sulfuric acid in there at all yeah sulfuric is really dangerous by the way uh if one little splash in your eye you go blind seriously so be very careful with the uh sulfuric acid um yeah all right sorry he's remaking me yeah i'm i'm far away okay there we are oh and now i'm even further away awesome okay um so scale so if we wanted to scale this up yeah could you set this up as kind of a production yeah yeah so you could set it up as production um you'd have to have here's the workflow that i think you should have i mean you're going to have to have some sort of a solvent remover um you're going to have to have some sort of way to actually reactor so you'd you would never do a scale up like that you know you you know so you would want a host enclosed yeah you'd have a closed reactor um and if you're using solvents of course you have to have a enough um you have to have enough solvent there uh and you have to have a control area for that solvent along with you know approved containers improved storage and if you're going to use any type of motors any in there along with that it has to be a c1 d2 piece of equipment so you know doing it on the lab bench is great but for production purposes there are other requirements you need to be thinking about so you would you would need to have um you know probably a start a stirred reactor with an air motor or a inert gas motor um and then you'd have to have a heater cooler heater chiller on that okay um and you can buy those at a number of places we we uh we often quote those in a quote and patrick package um if you have uh for fractron you can use our fractron to do all the solvent removal um if you have some road of apps you're going to need to have at least a 50 liter road of app um and the reason i recommend to have multiple road of apps or a fractron uh simply because you're going to be trying to remove the solvent also you know and what's great about the fractron is it doesn't have it has two different types of falling film okay it has a packed bed fractional uh falling film and it has a tube and tube tube and shell falling film so you can actually isolate one of those uh vessels one of those uh you know falling film evaporators and just just circulate it in there if you want to use it for a single purpose so that it's super versatile guys very nice yeah so um that would be that and then you're gonna need to have some way to remove all of the um you know delta nine from your reaction pot right so that means uh you know some sort of chromatography or some sort of thc remediation um yeah something along those lines so and we have gone over the thc remediation there's there's lots of different ways to do it there's not just one way um you know you guys can choose a choose whatever it is but we can also put that together into a package for you um and uh you know you know see how that goes along with slps and and uh you know and then training and consulting to really make it happen so what we've talked about is being able to put together a kit for you on the smaller side so it would be a small batch kind of thing that you you can do um it'll be a little more than the three thousand dollar little lab thing that we have here because that's that's just a one-off that's really small so we talked about that but then on the large scale side if you really want to do delta eight you're going to need you know from our equipment side of it you're looking at the fractron you're looking at you know you you need solvent you need the heater and the chiller you need the pure 99 full chromatography and all of this can be repurposed for other uses post extraction right right right yeah that's right true yeah you would use it for other things as well you'd use it in your isolate process you would use it obviously in your winterization process so you're going to be using all that stuff anyway so yeah and then you know we would give you all of our processing methods as well as part of that um and you know we list on that if we were to sell that it's like just over a million dollars yeah that's what we do it's a pretty high throughput though yeah a very high throughput oh my gosh the fractron will do how much yeah so i mean you would have uh you would have a you'd be able to 20 you know deal with it like 20 gallons an hour yeah flow through right right but you'd be able to deal with it with a very low operational cost oh yeah because it's all automated and then the pure 99 you're we're looking at pure 99 pushing through how many liters an hour we're um well we're eight liters an hour or eight liters a minute sorry excuse me eight liters a minute yeah times that's times 60 okay that's a big number yeah eight liters a minute on chromatography that is full out optimized for thc remediation which is what you need for this and that's just post thc remediation right correct so you you run it you've got it um and that through that's a huge throughput so you can get you know delta eight at a high level what what is uh what is the market right now right now for delta eight you know what i i looked uh on a couple different websites and um it was wildly varying um you know when we we looked at some of the delta eight we bought some delta eight and um you know wasn't it has i think a lot of those other things that you see in the um you know chromatogram those are they have they affect the aroma and the flavor so my view of the delta eight is that it has a definitely has to be formulated okay you're just going to put in straight up delta 8. well i don't know if you really want to do that because it's not not going to taste very good and um you know and or have no taste at all i mean you know most people want to enjoy the flavor and aroma right um in order to uh in order to really enjoy it so that that's uh yeah so i don't know what the what the price is but i think it's it's well it's it's a lot yeah i've heard ten dollars a gram that's what i heard you're higher than that so yeah but that's that's a lot of that's a lot of coin so there's a way there are ways to do that and you know for that we're actually doing a special right now rather than one million five thousand dollars we're going to do we're we'll actually give knock 20 off of that so show special 799 000. wow but you have to put in the code yes what's the code dr john rocks okay all right i think that's a wrap and as an alternate the other is a delta 8 lab so you can use dr john rox or delta 8 lab i use that code and will actually even do that for you if you're on and you want it even better yeah we'll even give an extra five percent for the first three that sounds like a good one yeah so we could put that together for you and uh you know basically gave you everything you need with a little sheet here's how you do it and and uh we if you send the test into us we can we can actually test it for you so and we're we do this all the time so that's this is our world and we want to make sure we've got that for you and then we're going to put this other kit together um and so we'll put we'll post that somewhere i don't know where we would post that uh i think we're going to we have a store we have store link that we can put on we'll put a smaller kit together for you know the small batch as well but uh if you need something then go on our website we've got our bot and you can try to stump our bot the bot is the bot rocks spot rocks that's pretty good i like it and just ask the questions and then you'll either get a call from myself or elijah or q or manual or whatever we can and we can answer more questions for you on the equipment itself uh but you know this works for any extract if you're a processor right now let's let's go we can talk about this all of our gear will interface we're co2 on our extraction side but we have we're selling our fractrons and our clear stills and our pure 99s to ethanol processors all day every day yeah um and the drain droids i mean they're yeah it's all going dry and fractron so anyway this was a phenomenal show lots of tables chromatographs chromatographs chromatographs yeah i love that we went through it so so this is good and i don't think anyone else i think did we did we win a prize because i don't think there's another webinar you guys have sat on where there's a million dollar offering did we do it we have never we have never done that actually we've never and we don't usually do that but this is kind of a one-off thing we don't like to push our product but we we did want to give you a special for being here and that's where we're at sounds good so didn't mean to uh oversell but this was awesome there will be a replay and this was predominantly education that's what we like to do yeah and we love being here because we like to hear your questions we love to interface with you that's what we want to do and again congratulations to samuel gorton ennisburg falls vermont uh king of bourbons thank you and i know uh did you see bowdoin and jeff chime saying yes vermont i saw that and i wasn't sure you know yes oh that's right that's what's this you said visser's comes via vermont how does that work why is there native wisers yeah they're their neighbors it works it's good canadian rye is really good that's okay anyway that it is good um delta eight delta a thc we worked we talked about all of these we talked about lists of compounds cannabis components cannabidolic acid we there's a lot of things that we talked about that i have no idea how to pronounce isomerization yeah yes richard thank you for popping that into me i i did it and i was correct we have a lot of chemists who uh come to our podcast yeah we do chemists investors farmers processors we i just we really appreciate you we really appreciate your questions and just keep bringing them in always ask your questions we convert those into faqs all the time live tour cbd jam sessions we've got our calculators use them talk to us uh we answered a lot of stuff here this is really this was good we need to put together as uh like a conversion calculator first delta eight we'll work on that one yeah it's it's just kind of thinking out loud but we'll do that oh sure awesome thank you for being here we really appreciate you we went a couple over a couple minutes over um but thank you and uh sorry if this seemed a little hurried but we wanted to get through all of that for you today so thank you for

in this industry you just do not want to wake up because they will throw all the rules right out the window and upend an entire industry that people count on and that has been growing for the past four years so we're going to dive into that now on this very depressing episode of hello my name is tom i am a cannabis lawyer you can email me atomiccollateralbase.com that's the name of my law firm this is my youtube channel canvas legalization news uh smash them likes and subscribes if you find this episode uh useful and we're going to be covering a whole bunch of new regulations that come out of the dea regarding what it is to be hemp and it appears that the dea has a really hard time doing anything except for arresting people and they're going to try to set up something that might threaten all the farmers that are out there and uh we'll end uh the resurgence in d8 thc that we're seeing that's delta a thc that has been huge and it's just one of these things that you wake up on and like i advised clients and now like this new stuff comes out and i'm like remember all that stuff that i said totally out the window now because there's a whole new thing that we have to talk about it's um it's really annoying and if you want to talk about that don't forget just to google cannabis lawyer you'll find me tom at my website cannabisindustrylawyer.com an online resource where this will eventually be housed as well we're going to go and have a deep dive into the 24 pages of the interim final rule and again if you're a friend of the show you know that we do talk about uh policy a lot and how laws are changed not only how laws are changed but how laws are enforced and one of the things that is going to happen is the dea needs to enforce the 2018 hemp farm bill regulations fortunately those are still not yet there we still have this crop year to to get our supply and hopefully an exposed factory law doesn't make uh all the the current supply of hemp uh you know make it illegal but uh there is some terrible stuff just terrible stuff and uh first before we dig into it we're going to give a couple of shout outs and use that to do the summary for um what we're going to be talking about here today and uh let's let's get into it and so shout out to rod kite kite on cannabis i i saw this he broke that story last evening because they come out today and only came out yesterday they've been published uh yeah so they've been published yesterday the dea's interim final rule and what he does here mr kite explains this whip stuff and so the whip stuff it looks like it is out and let me blow that up for you so you can actually see that the farm bill contemplated and legalized whip but it's it's w-i-p-h-e you see w-i-p-h-e stands for while in process hemp extract right there so it's while in process hemp extract and this is um this is industry standard you know like you all that hemp that's in the field a lot of it is not going to be premium smokeable hempflower a lot of it's going to be processed and when that process is is being done um the the point three percent level is not always met you know sometimes it goes a little bit up but then by the time that the processing is completed uh the the the extract is compliant now um it appears that the dea's rules has um made illegal uh these while and uh processing hemp extracts and and they're not supposed to and the reason they're not supposed to is because the farm bill itself says that you know the definition of hemp underneath it in the 2018 farm bill is a particular thing and the regulations are overstepping on what the actual text of the law says and so we're going to have some legal challenges if this ever goes into effect we are in the what they call the public comment period right now and that public comment period is quite important um they actually start to reference it right at the top of these now all these links of course are in the description so while you're down there don't forget to give us a thumbs up but then click on over to the department of justice and you can go through the whole 24 pages yourself and and swear appropriately because you should and then not only that uh it does say now you have 60 days to comment on this and now you have 60 days to comment on it it tells you how to comment on it what do you do you go to regulations.gov and then there's going to be some forms you can fill out there and not only that you have to make sure that you reference this particular type of docket number and this particular rin i don't know index number that it has right there you can see it rin on the screen one one one seven a b fifty three uh and that is uh probably up here there it is that one right there uh and while these things start to drill into it the big takeaway is that the processing of hemp will be severely restricted because that it has said that this work in process hemp extract this wp wiphe which i'll be sometimes referring to as whip is no longer considered hemp and it is now considered marijuana which would be just just catastrophic and of course attorney kite here is reasoning that this this goes against the very text of the uh the farm bill itself because the text of the farm bill itself has this on a dry weight basis 0.3 on a dry weight basis and again this is the the text of the farm bill right here which defines hemp and extracted it from the controlled substances act whether we're growing or not with a delta tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 on a dry weight basis and force whatever reason and i think the reason is that the the dea just likes arresting people for anything that resembles the cannabis plant uh they have made the uh point three percent uh illegal uh because it is not a it is being processed and so like kite argues that the the statute contemplated this this was how cbd had been extracted for a long time in the last farm bill and it is you know for a long time and so how are you going to take your your cbd hemp and get it extracted without falling under with this new regulation says is a chemical process that is actually marijuana and not hemp which is just ridiculous but um i don't get it well i kind of get it they like to arrest people and they don't they don't want to do anything besides that and they they probably are still butt hurt that the the hemp has been legalized and is no longer included in the the definition of marijuana so please do uh read kite on law it's in the in the in the comments regarding uh the hemp w-i-p-h extracts being considered a chemical process that would not be subject to the controlled substances act so there it is this the ifr is deemed and the ifr is the interim final rule the interim final rule is right here you can also find that of course linked below and that is what is currently in the process of being finalized and so the public comment period is there again go to regulations.gov and then don't forget to to cite this particular docket number that you need to be able to make your comment and say no this is terrible uh doing this is going to end the industry and then it kind of gets worse because the lesser cannabinoids are there lesser cannabinoids for example your delta h delta eight cannabinoid um that's this part two that rod did again this is in the in the uh description section below and you can read the final rule here don't in the course rod is very good he does the same thing don't forget to go there and comment by before october 20th uh because that is when you have to get your comments in to say oh stop stop doing this now this one has to do with um the dea is improperly criminalizing delta 8 thc derived from hemp and so delta 8 is the hottest thing and somebody called me on it today not not today this week though uh and i had explained to them no if the delta 8 is prepared from the hemp it's probably lawful now i don't know when they are going to try to make it illegal and it turned out it was this morning and so uh what they are now saying is that and then here it is this is the ifr language excerpt from the uh the full rule here the 2018 farm bill does not impact the controlled status of synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols four controlled substance codes number 7370 because the statutory definition of hemp is limited to materials that are derived from the plant cannabis sativa that's it for synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols the concentration of delta ix is not a determining factor of whether the material remains controlled substance all synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols remain a schedule one controlled substance so um what does it mean to be synthetically derived and then a sudden and that what what happens is you look at the law and then the law might have a definition regarding what the the uh meaning of syntax or synthetic derived is uh rod is citing to wikipedia here so i'm assuming that in either the 2018 farm bill or or the controlled substances acts that has included improperly included marijuana since its inception 50 years ago probably also does not define synthetic so the dea is saying that when you take hemp and you process it and then that process leads uh through a chemical method to uh delta eight thc which is exceedingly popular and so there's all these businesses that are out there right now and my my hemp farm plans are on hold which sucks because i wanted to really open that hemp farm and because now it looks like all right so you pick the the hemp and then you start processing it and somebody shows up and arrests you or you pick the hemp and you do anything on it that has more than point three point three percent total thc point five percent uh if you're over that limit then you're like into you might get arrested territory based on the new usda regulations and again i need to impress upon you there is an election in november uh the the current administration is no friend uh to either hemp or to marijuana uh cannabis at all and so um three senators need to change in in the senate and then after those three senators uh are at least in the minority the safe banking act can pass i'm not going to say the moore act is going to pass immediately but the safe banking hack will pass and then after the industry is able to grow and access banking for a little bit longer then they can start lobbying congress and say hey what the f are you doing and so right now i hope every single hemp farmer in america once again you should go to regulations.gov and don't forget to cite this this rn1117-ab-53 pile of [ __ ] that the dea just [ __ ] out on the whole industry and say no um the 2018 farm bill legalized hemp and uh you can't then go back to the administrative rules and say okay well legalize temp but you cannot use it if you try to do anything with it it magically becomes marijuana uh if you go over 0.3 delta 9 but that's what it says 0.3 percent delta 9. now but that doesn't matter because the usda regulation says we're going to just do total thc so they take the statute and they go screw the statute we're not going to look at that and say what that is we want to keep arresting people how come we're letting all these farmers grow this marijuana uh and and law enforcement confusion needs to just end and thc hemp should just be taken out of the controlled substances act altogether but you know joe biden's not even up for that right now maybe he will evolve on that like he did but anyway that's that's that's neither here nor there the most important thing that you do go to regulations.gov cite that uh and then be kind uh you know don't just tell these uh administrative thugs that they are administrative thugs and the only thing they're really interested in is arresting people uh please say i have invested so much money in my hemp operation including the extractions and all these other things that equipment buys that i needed i'm now greatly concerned that my process with processing my hemp which is a work in process of hemp extract where the delta 9 thc levels routinely exceed 0.3 percent while it is just still in processing but until it becomes you know a broad spectrum full spectrum extract or you could just refine it all out so that it can become a broad spectrum extract and just have cbd that doesn't is that a crime is it a crime to try to start processing your your cbd through your extractors at all i mean how are you supposed to monitor and watch your your thc levels while you're extracting your hemp in process i mean and that's that's what in in the first part of rod's two-part series on these abysmal new dea uh final rules uh you know he he really kind of gets that in the first part about with uh this work in process hemp extract as you are doing it uh that's not dry weight basis all right so if the hemp that you had you know as a result a cannabis derivative extract or product that exceeds all right that's just what they're saying but you have the dry weight basis from the hemp and so that is that is by statute definition and so if it was picked and it was tested according to the usd regs and it's 0.3 on a dry weight basis great then when you throw it into the extractor and that point three percent is is a little bit uh conjugate because you're you're you're stripping uh the cannabinoids from the plant material uh and then they're also requiring it to be 0.3 there uh which is not what the statute says that's it's a dry weight basis so like you've picked the hemp you've tested the hemp it's hemp now that hemp can magically be transformed into marijuana when you start extracting it or uh it could be magically transformed into another controlled substance which is a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol and so that would be trying to attack and eviscerate the delta eight stuff that they're doing which is not going to do anybody any favors all those people that are right now processing into delta 8 that are trying to sell their stuff when will they have before johnny law comes and starts arresting them you see this is not yet in effect because these rules they they are effective after the public comment period which we are currently in uh please go again to regulations.gov and then cite that and then print this out take some time to review it and it just looks like the only thing that the dea is really really concerned about uh is is arresting people for marijuana uh and so it's it's just it's just terrible and then it's another one of these aspects where it's terrible and then not only is it another one of those aspects where it's terrible it's another one those aspects where it's like okay we're relying on these rules here's what we know we also know that it's going to change and then one day it just totally changes and so um i hate that but uh the the from october 31st or 29th i think is when the the usda uh rules came out for the 2021 crop year and then now uh you know about 10 11 months later uh with the dea's final rule it's just been terrible i mean like hemp was legalized it was great and then the usda says whoa and then the dea says uh-uh and so it's like they are just trying to kill this whole industry after uh people fought so hard for it to get here and so uh keep fighting so that it will continue to be here but the um i'm not going to say that an administrative change wouldn't be a good thing you know i'm coming at you from my my kitchen table because sometimes when you have these types of cataclysmic conversations you should be at a kitchen table it just makes it seem a little bit easier to take um it's it's really not the best to be honest and so dig into these regs the quick and dirty of it is it's like it looks like it's putting an end to delta eight it also looks like it's putting an end to hemp processing which doesn't make any lick a sense whatsoever and yeah i really wish i had better information i or better news uh better news is coming um but the current administration doesn't seem like they really give to craps about uh the hemp industry sucks anyway uh tune in this weekend we're gonna have a much happier show we're gonna be celebrating our five thousand uh subscriber and and having a good little time but i gotta get going i'm gonna read this and then i got another call starting in 10 minutes on a different matter which is still good law fortunately um and that's just par for the course for the canvas industry everything you get the angle you get the hang of everything and then you understand the rules and then throw them out the window good times all right thank you so much for sticking around and if you wanted to read uh rod's great two articles there in the the description section while you're down there you know click subscribe click like and then also click on over to the actual text of the dea's interim final rule and follow up with them so that you can comment at regulations.gov and and disapprove vehemently about this and tell them to back off uh tell them to not enforce these rules this might be another thing where now is this going to be an appropriation thing because if this if this administration or if this administrative body because it's the dea i'm not sure if the uh the administrative change well hopefully they would have named a new administrator to the dea maybe cory booker or something that would be hilarious if cory booker was the dea admin and um uh it yeah i hate being at a loss for words but that happens because suddenly you'll just you know everybody's got a plan to get punched in the face and welcome to the cannabis industry so um yeah damn it and so again one thing that another thing we can do in the congress is is is just to fund them and so yeah defund the dea if somebody has a a hemp license from their state you know try to make sure that there's no money for uh enforcing the the federal hemp laws in that state uh something that they did with like the robocraft amendment but for hemp uh that's that's one way to try to neuter these uh regulations that they have another way is to i don't know remove thc cannabis from the controlled substances act because it never should have been there and that was the point of the schaffer commission that nobody listened to back in 1972 and they just kept arresting people what they just keep arrest yeah anyway um well tgif everybody how come that", "gOUm8OsWW_o": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is finally my chance to try delta 8 products i know a lot of people have been requesting it it might not be the brand that you requested but you know i heard what you guys recommended naruto recommended three chai um but this is a company that actually uh contacted me i checked out their website and it looked pretty good from just the website alone and uh yeah delta 8 is basically legal all across the united states so if you're in a state that doesn't necessarily you know have recreational cannabis this is definitely a better alternative you know it's legal everything it's just like cbd you can purchase it offline and get it delivered to your door dee was kind enough to contact me and send me a few things let's just show you guys what i got so far so pretty much a full gram cartridge of i believe gorilla glue some gummies and jack hair disposable pod so i'm gonna be using this one in today's video and then these will have its own separate video but shout out to d for uh just you know hooking me up and basically sending some of their great products towards my way uh but yes i will be posting the link in the comments below or i might not but uh the company is called delta 8 hemp so check them out i don't know if i'll be posting any links at all because i've been deleted before over cbd products and this is the new wave i don't want youtube to i don't want to give youtube a reason for you know to delete me again so uh the company is delta eight hemp guys all right so it's right here i figure we start off with the disposable because everything you need is just right here in this container or this packaging so i'm excited you know delta athc and also qr code and i believe it says 90 thc delta athc with 10 terpenes so it should be pretty flavorful you know so let's just go and they also do show the lag results on their website guys so that's what's cool about them so what i'm gonna assume that this tastes like or what it is it's probably gonna be distilled i don't know if there's live resin delta eight products so um yeah also i do notice that it is a usbc charger on the bottom even though this is a disposable what what's wrong with disposables is that sometimes you run out of battery before you finish the oil this gives you a chance to charge it and finish off the oil that maybe is not you know has not been vaped so uh i wonder if you could no so right off the bat you can see it's kind of clear through here but not bad all right so let's hit this cheers wow that was a very thin hit like the vapor production from that was a lot and i think it's because the oil is a bit thinner than usual but very enjoyable i get a lemony aftertaste which is very strong towards the end no sensation to cough i don't know if i should be taking blinkers on this um but let's just let's just take another hit that's not bad it's not bad at all it's like almost like a sprite but less sugary less less sweet there's the cough let's just talk about delta eight or at least what i know and if i you know miss anything i'll try to post it right here but delta 8 is basically the lesser known cannabinoid you know there's delta 9 which is what we all know and love right but then there's delta 8 which is barely getting like attention now and i've heard that people use delta 8 to to lower their tolerance on delta 9 basically i guess this a tolerance on this is not the same as a tolerance with delta 9 but i could be wrong because everyone is different as well but i've read that i've heard that and uh you know i don't know if that's true or not i honestly ain't feeling too much right now i do feel a little bit of a buzz this is jack herrera so i should you know start feeling a lot more talkative than usual but this is ninety percent thc delta eight thc with ten percent terps so it's definitely in the higher range of potency when it comes to delta eight um but like i said this is the first time i've tried delta a in any capacity and honestly i'm surprised you know like i i feel better for the people that are in illegal states that cannot get delta nine cannabis or cannabis products that we all you know are familiar with but this is a pretty good alternative a pretty good substitute if you ask me you know well let's just take another maybe a blinker i don't know oh oh now i feel like oh wow wow it's kind of kind of a different feeling but damn i'm actually feeling it quite a lot right now [Music] like i said guys i am no expert in delta eight honestly the first video i've ever mentioned delta 8 was the canon clear video and i've heard that delta 8 can have a pinkish hue you know i'm still getting [ __ ] for that video uh today you know but you know i do learn like within that six months or seven months since i made that video you know i've you know learned a lot and changed my opinion on things you know and that's that's what you get to see with this youtube channel you get to see my growth uh you also get to see you know me learn as well because i'm not the [ __ ] cannabis guru master you know i'm saying i'm just the average guy just like you guys that decided to film some [ __ ] and yeah i may know more than some people but you know i am no way saying that i'm a [ __ ] a scientist in this [ __ ] you know i'm just a consumer just like you guys but my thoughts on delta 8 pretty [ __ ] good i do feel it right now so i'm definitely going to enjoy some maybe some gta 4 or possibly edit i don't know but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video peace out guys [Music] you", "fbcpgZRn7zA": "we've got some oil to make and this is gonna be part of the selection there we've got some really good strange brother Perry bone tangerine dream super Silver Haze any of this stuff is going to be amazing [Music] lovely thank you injury on all of the grinding up and as you can see we have lots and lots and lots of lovely ground of weed and it smells delicious so what we need to do now not this Bastille need to add the solvent in this cases isopropyl alcohol which is 99.999% pure alcohol a little bit of water and with the right purging there's no reason to to worry this is perfectly safe so here we have I think it's 500 grams of cannabis smokers you probably want to look away right now and what we'll do all you're doing now is we're just going to recover and of course this is completely this is very very very dangerous if you're smoke please don't smoke around when you're doing this the vapor from alcohol is highly volatile and should you be daft enough to smoke around it whilst it's all the vapors in the air you'll very likely to cause an explosion and do yourself a lot of damage if not worse kill yourself so we are getting now I know it's not quite a lot and it is quite a lot of alcohol but we're trying to create enough liquid in there to extract as much of the cannabinoids as we can this is as you know this is a lot of different types of bugs in this one so we're hoping for a very very very good oil now again it's volatile so please don't use your bare hands with this and make sure that your gloves are suitable for using with alcohol we're going to give this a good thing I think it's probably about another half a liter to be sure so you probably put in for navarre liters and that's plenty we don't want us to suffocate the cannabis so we're going to just keep stirring this for a few more minutes and then we're gonna leave it for 15 minutes right all soaked so times up it's now ready to start filtering out Toby hundred 20 micron bag stop pouring this in now now I'll do the first pot quickly and then get it going then I'll carry on afterwards so you can actually see what we're doing trying to get out of less of the plant matter as possible as you can see they didn't wanna look now all of this is pure all the alcohol now with extracted order the THC the CBD all the other cannabinoids that you expect so we'll just leave that just for moment we'll come back to that and I'll carry on doing this now with this as you can see it's all well cleaned and filtered out what we're going to do now is we're going to hide it probably want to put in there anyway so that's perfect now we'll make sure that this us out with the wait a minute but big blue Peter here we can do it in a minute right so it's all clipped it on make sure that the fans running to try and blow the vapor away because alcohol vapor is quite heavy it goes on and we're on and that literally is the start perfect slowly reducing ugly I'm still got my lots going there but well we'll get back to it and show you at the end about the podium you can see now is now ready another couple more minutes and then this will go straight into the video and you'll be able to see how it looks so as you can see now the oil has completely reduced down and what's left is this let you concealed up properly but this is fika well it's getting there it's a little bit more purging to go but that's how it is and it won't take long now so this will very gently after everything a little piece I'll sit in here and to a bowl of water I'll do I'll stop to gently heat the water up and slowly this will reduce more and you can kind of gauge where the line is now I'll see you in a minute Wayne nicely those little bubbles are caused by the alcohol leaving the liquid hopefully in a few more hours these bubbles would have reduced down and we'll carry on well as you can see now I mean there's virtually nothing left so what we're gonna do now is as there's still more alcohol in there I'm gonna add three mils of water and what this is going to do is that to try and draw up the last and again you carry on until there are no bubbles left right guys so we've purged as you can see now no bubbles it's now very very thick so what we're going to do now starts region I'm using a two three male 1 here buttburn enough it's a two mil 1 and 10 mils I'm just gonna show you this one dunk fast so you understand how quickly how easy it is to do so this is how it goes doodles it's that simple well guys as you can see we are finally finished of all of that we've many that's just over half a kilo of canvas I think it's about 540 grams into in that batch that has given us eighty seven grams of theta so I hope this video has hoped I know it's been quite not when it's been over a couple of days so thank you for your patience as you can see it's not something that you can do very very quickly it takes a lot of time and effort and I hope that you'll manage to do the same", "2mPgN8FttQE": "hi I'm drew owner of connoisseur concentrates and I'm Kendall logistics coordinator at connoisseur concentrates today we're going to be explaining our solution sample pack what comes in it and how to correctly use it connoisseur concentrates has created an all-natural terpene blend solution that can be used with any extract to turn it into a liquid to be used in any vapor pen without the need for PG VG or P eg our solution is geared to industrial manufacturers of vapor pens dispensaries and people's wishing to start their own company manufacturing vapor pens our sample pack is a great inexpensive way for you to try a few flavors and see what you like before committing to some of our larger sizes our sample packs include three different flavors of our solution with 0.6 grams in each file it also has three disposable vapor pins which match each flavor it also has a mixing vial an eyedropper to fill your pens more easily we found that you only need about a half a gram of the solution to turn any extract into a liquid for a vapor pen it depends on how hard you're starting extract is and how soft you want your ending viscosity to be depending on what type of vapor pen you're using so for a hard shatter normally use about a half a gram if you're starting out with a softer oil sometimes you can use a quarter gram and depending on how soft your oil is for co2 extracts you may only need a few drops to start you take the mixing vial that was included in your sample pack put it on your scale and tear it out then you add one gram of your extract into the mixing vial once you have your extract weighed out it's time to add your solution you may notice depending on what flavor you pick that your solution is separated which is perfectly normal it's a variation between the terpenes and the flavouring and once you mix it in with your extract it's going to stay blend it and not separate again so go ahead and shake up your bottle a little bit open it up and you're going to want to add approximately 0.3 to 0.5 grams and it's really going to depend on what type of extract that you started with again if you started with something hard like shatter go ahead and add a half a gram and if you started with something pretty runny and start out with the third of a gram you can always add more it's a little harder to add less once you've added your solution to your extract it's time to blend the two together you have a couple different options of doing this normally what we do is we just heat it up a little bit with the lighter in your sample file and it's going to mix in real nicely it takes about 30 seconds of blending and then you're all done we all know that heating your extract and darken it so there's a couple different options if you're really interested in art darkening your oil at all you can let it sit overnight or sit there and start for awhile with no heat and it's going to blend in together if you just want to get it done heat it up just a little bit and it's going to blend in real quickly although you may just get a shade darker for today's purposes I'm going to go ahead and heat it up with the lighter and let you see what it looks like when you blend it using just a normal flame what we recommend is that you heat the solution with the lighter just until it starts to boil you'll see it bubbling just a little bit it's already hot at that point you don't need to heat it any more then you take your stirrer rod and start blending the two together it's very simply it's important to note that it may not blend in the first five seconds sometimes you got to take 30 seconds to blame if you're in a rush you can heat it a little more but a little patience is a helpful here if you're trying to retain your color that heat is enough to blend most things and simply stirring it for 20 or 30 seconds is good if you notice it's not fully blended or it's not the way that you like it just add a little bit more heat to it and continue to stir and it will blend right up for you if you're making see-through vapor pens like the 5-10 styles and color is extremely important you just let it sit overnight if you let it sit with no heat it's going to dissolve and blend on its own you're not going to lose any coloring and it's going to work perfectly if you're feeling the burner included in the sample pack you're going to notice that there's a small white tube on the inside of the burner make sure that your liquid does not go in that tube that's an air return - there's a sponge on the exterior of that tube that's where you're going to want to put your liquid make sure not to overfill your burner you only want to put a half a gram you want to make sure that the liquid gets all the way absorbed into the sponge or it's going to leak out at the top remember it holds about 1/2 of a gram which is about one inch up from the bottom of your eyedropper once your sponge is fully saturated with liquid we've included some tops for your pens go ahead and put your top on and then you're ready to go each pen is rated for about 400 puffs which means that it's realistically going to hold one half gram you'll go all the way through it you may be able to fill it one more time but it's really only rated for one use but if the battery lasts go ahead and give it a try remember that our disposable pans are simply that they're just there in case you don't have your own vapor pen it's not going to replace one of the really cool vapor pens that you can buy at the store feel free to get any vapor pen you want they work well in any vapor pen but in case you don't have one and you don't really want to run out to the store and commit to that we've just included some inexpensive ones in the kit so that you have something to sample without having to run all over the place once you've had a chance to play around with our sample pack and find out if this product works for you contact us we have larger options for the solution we've also got some good options on all the disposable pens we have a good line the 510 pens any hardware you need let us know we also have some solutions for filling bottling and any size scale we can comment thank you for watching our video we hope you enjoy your sample pack please write us a review and let us know what you think and for larger applications be sure to check out our both mixing instructions see you soon", "olQLO9pDtHY": "on today's review we are going to be going over the 800 milligram one gram choice distill a dart and the one thing that made me grab this really is because if you can see here it is actually tested as a batch number all that normally these aren't just tested it's just a caregiver that's just poster puts their brain down to a disco and it's like you're my my stuff but this is actually tested so it really caught my eye and I really want to see what it's all about there's no flavor into this it's just an unflavored as you can see right there distill the dart pure distill it Dart let me get that out of the packaging real quick so if you guys have never seen it distill it Dart it is basically distill it in a little syringe type like shot type thing with a bunch of teeth seen a straight THC and if you don't know what distill it is it's basically wax that's liqui formed 800 milligrams honey most of it if you ever find a dart that is completely black it's not distill it is RSO that you know that you can eat this you cannot eat well I mean you might be actually able to eat it because it is a hundred percent to snow and it is tested it's pretty thick too went ahead and took off the top just so you can see how thick it is and that's what it looks like without the top it's basically like a shot and it just comes out just like that but yeah this is pretty thick this is thicker than the court that I got choice distilled art so on this Deb we're gonna get a little creative I'm gonna take that dart slap it right on here stuff is super thick so we're gonna take this to Stuart put some of that element on there if you guys haven't seen that video go check it out it's the last video a $75 grandma wax choice labs mix with element TGA there you go so smooth"}
