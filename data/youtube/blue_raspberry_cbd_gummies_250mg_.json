(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "WMwvIJ4BUgI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's video CBD gummies for dummies' was able to help you when you are making your CBD purchase decisions to know the difference between the major categories within gummies isolates and fused coded full

going to be picked up in the video [ __ ] where did i leave off at hey man it's mike from bonus cbd.com today we got uh hometown's new gummy bears man this is that delta eight thc pretty [ __ ] excited about this supposedly delta athc is supposed to be some strong [ __ ] it's supposed to knock you on your ass man i'm really curious if it's gonna taste the same as the other blueberry uh gummy bears they kind of had a sour taste to it it was pretty good man so i'm really curious about that so let's go ahead and start talking a little bit about delta athc supposedly what what everybody's saying is delta 18c is supposed to be more of a medical property thc more so than delta 9. delta 9 thc is the one that's regulated that's the one that you can't have above 0.3 percent you have that have to have it below now all the other tastes like delta delta eight thc a thcc all that can just be as high as they [ __ ] possibly can or as low as they possibly can either one there's no regulations on those guys it's just a delta nine thc that has the regulation but let's go ahead and crack this open and try these out now when we got these in they told us two get you feeling real good three you getting couch locked so i'm thinking about just trying out three i'm gonna try out these two and then go from there has no smell so we can't do a smell test let's try these gummies out man all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit more about the thc's and the cbd properties that are inside these gummies um first off though the flavor it tastes just like the other blueberry gummies if you've ever had that if you haven't it's just a sour patch kid with the blueberry sour patch kid pretty much that's the easiest way to explain the flavor of that one now so one thing about this is it has like hardly any cbd properties in it it's point if you look at the lab results it's going to say 0.01 percent they round it down to zero that's why you can see on the side of this package it says zero milligrams of cbd there's not enough cbd in it for them to say hey these are cbd gummies that's just kind of false advertising now it's only pretty much only delta 8 thc and that's supposed to be good for medical use now as far as recreational side goes we're still waiting on that to kick in so we're gonna go ahead and give it 30 minutes and then we're gonna come right back and i'm gonna tell you how i'm feeling off these delta a cbds tell you how good they are how bad they are so stay tuned i'll be right back man all right man we're back after waiting 30 minutes for these to uh kick in i do feel a little something off of it more so than what i was expecting i wasn't expecting a whole lot so let's go ahead and talk about how it made me feel imagine taking like one or two beers that's about the same amount of feels that you get off of this i can see why it's good for some people and i can see why it's not good for others a lot of people are like oh delta eight that sounds spicy it's new it's not bad i don't mind it at all one thing i like about this is there's like no thc in it so if anybody needs to take it and you don't need thc in your system yeah you'll be all right man now if you're wanting a little bit more of a kick there might be something else stronger i want to say actually i have more of a feeling off the cbd gummies versus the delta 8 gummies that one gave me a harder feeling quicker this one's giving me more of a deep feeling i don't know if that makes sense i don't know how to explain it other than that but that's what i get off of this so it's pretty good i like it like i was saying though earlier the flavor is going to be a lot like a sour patch kid so that's always nice it doesn't have that dirty hemp [ __ ] dirt taste nobody wants that [ __ ] all right so if you're curious man first off i didn't tell you all to stay tuned for the promo code so stay tuned for the promo code y'all are about to get that let's talk about the price point of this guy real quick so the other gummies they're 25 bucks this one's 30. i can actually get behind that price point i did say you do feel a little bit more off the other gummies quicker and i was saying that this one's a little deeper but man you do feel a little bit better off of this one than the gummies five dollars more makes sense i'm cool with that doesn't hurt my feelings now so let's get let's hit you with that promo code let's keep the promo code simple this time we're just gonna hit you with delta eight that's gonna be the promo code it's not going to be the [ __ ] numeric roman [ __ ] delta with the triangle and [ __ ] [ __ ] illuminati [ __ ] okay it's just going to be delta all right man so that's that's going to be it for this video i'd like these gummies they're pretty good so yeah man y'all have a good one we'll we'll see y'all next time peace so quick update video on those gummies uh because it didn't really start hitting me until after i went home those things are bad ass man uh yeah there's he was not joking when he said three will knock you in the couch because i only took two and i would say maybe about 30 minutes hour after i left after we shot the video is when it really kicked in uh yeah they're strong delta a no there's no need for the cbd in it man the delta a if you're wanting something recreational and uh not illegal this this shit's good this shit's good so definitely try it out man all right y'all have a good one hey man be sure to check out our two videos down at the bottom and uh if you like our [ __ ] and [ __ ]

are like hair on that there's these are CBD gummies and I already opened it says here it's a full spectrum organic cannabidiol l-theanine Piper myth this something or others some other thing that I can't pronounce and some other thing that I can't pronounce no THC and no marijuana but my body hurts I don't want to get high so let's try this what's in here oranges in a red so this orange one also tiny look at it can you see it mmm Harel serving size one gummy ten milligrams per gummy let's see how I feel later hello everyone so it's been a little while since I took the gummy and maybe I would say like 20 or 30 minutes but I am like super tired right now and I think it's only 8 10 p.m. and it's too early to go asleep but I think that I'm gonna brush my teeth anyway because just in case I fall asleep I don't wanna like fall asleep without brushing my teeth because that's just weird and gross but I'm gonna try to stay awake for a little bit longer but I don't think that I will be and I will be super upset if like I go to bed soon and then wake up at like 4:00 in the morning or something but tired alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "ARVSswHjBDY": "you want gummy bears I got gummy bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and try some if you do want to try something check the description below you're gonna find a link directly to the big co website takes drinkler to the product buy it okay put it in your cart send it to your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power

gummies with you guys i want to tell\u00a0\nyou how i feel when i eat them what they taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "dh5AVKuMJ4c": "the Joe Rogan experience gotta get off the CBD oil man his mess around your brain man you can't be too relaxed right yeah that's CBD [ __ ] it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time yeah I never realized it was doing what you said yes I was more achy than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "cFkATLe5J3A": "so as you may or may not know CBD oil has gotten tons of positive reviews in the marketplace due to its ability to induce relaxation instead of the high filling however there is limited information about the appropriate dosage for once use and it has been challenging to settle on definite quantity of CBD CBD that a person can take since the substance that interacts with the anti endocannabinoid system receptors meaning that it plays a role in the secretion of the hormones that are related to our response to stress so this system it changes one's psychology changes so physiological changes sorry so the dosage it's gonna vary depending on the CBD concentration the weight of the user and just his or her own body chemistry so I did do a little digging and this is what I found the current measure that's recommended by many of the CBD experts is that we take one to six milligrams of CBD for every ten pounds so this measure it actually applies at a 220 pound individual can comfortably take twenty to thirty milligrams of CBD while a 165 pound person can completely do can-can comfortably do with ten to twenty milligrams these measurements are just what works for a majority of individuals it's not does it mean that that's the scale so you never know until you try and I remember the first time my friend introduced me to try CBD started at 50 milligrams a day and I had no problem with it I felt a little drowsy I had a little bit of dry mouth at the same quantity so you need to just experiment until you find what's comfortable for your body and the other requirement is that you take they say take CBD twice a day for better results so a 220-pound err will take 10 to 15 milligrams in the morning in the same quantity at bedtime so you should this quantity when you're first starting out on seat with CBD just to kind of have a consistency for the best results however after a month or two of usage you can actually double its insure and no strong with me endo cannabinoid receptors will have adapted to the effects of CBD and this was just some research that I that I found you can find it to the experts in the field actually recommend that daily dose should should not exceed two hundred milligrams but you know you might be having questions about whether there there's a difference between the percentage of the CBD and its measure in milligram and these dosage recommendations are actually measured in milligrams since many CBD oils they are naturally extracted so that means they're a hundred percent pure so to start with twenty milligrams CBD per day and see how that works for you also you know consult with your doctor if you feel better about it and see what he or she would recommend for you and and also I really think that it depends on why you're using CBD and this is just my opinion I think that if you're using it maybe for some sort of physical pain then I think that you would need to take maybe more but if you're you but if you're using it for some sort of anxiety take less I don't know I usually I take mine specifically for anxiety and my boyfriend takes it for sleep and to have an extra pep in his day and also I know a few people that have taken it for headaches for for elements for for pain of physical physical pain so like I said I'll do some other videos on different reasons that CBD oil is taken for what reasons like I did another video on the my anxiety that I have and the reason that I take CBD for it and then when I'm sleep and then I'm going to cover another one on migraines headaches because it works amazing for that and yeah so share comment like if you take CBD oil let me know in the comments below how much you take what you take it for how much you weigh what you would recommend and or if you have a doctor that recommended how much you should take then just let me know in the comments below and I will see you guys on the next video bye", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "BEe0Urc7S00": "hi guys alright so this video should appeal to anyone with a sweet tooth because we're going to be talking about CBD gummies if you're watching this you probably know a thing or two about CBD already maybe you've tried the CBD oil or capsules and you're thinking about branching out to other products well CBD gummies are a great alternative to consume CBD they're sweet they're fun they come in a variety of flavors and they're super convenient and discreet so let me show you a few tested and trusted companies that sell CBD gummies so that you can satisfy your sweet tooth and enjoy those incredible CBD virtues also if you want to buy any CBD products click the link in the video description that's where you'll find the best and latest deals so first on the list we have royal CBD gummies these guys are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD in each gummy they're offered at $79.99 and the pack contains 30 gummies they come in a round shape and they're or they're offered in an assortment of three flavors strawberry grape and orange they use only natural ingredients and they have no animal derivatives which means that there are a hundred percent vegan next on the list is Charlotte's Web gummies these guys provide three areas of focus for their gummies so if you're having trouble sleeping they have gummies specific for that if you want gummies to relax they have the calm focus gummies and then they have the recovery targeted gummies so each pack contains 60 servings with 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy the sleep version is raspberry flavor and it contains melatonin the calm version is lemon-lime flavored and the recovery pack is ginger flavored and contains turmeric and each pack is sold by a Charlotte's Web at $54.99 then there are two CBD effects products that I want to share with you the first one is just the regular gummies these guys are sold for 49.99 and there are 60 gummies per pack but each gummy is only packed with 5 milligrams of CBD that's one of the lower dosage and it's a great option if you're just getting started with CBD these are mixed berry flavored and they're also vegan the other product is the CBDs melatonin gummies for sleep so obviously these should be taken right before you go to bed and these will help you get a good night's rest so same price and same amount of gummy bears per pack except these gummy bears are loaded with 10 milligrams of CBD and 5 milligrams of melatonin the flavor is juicy lemon and of course they are also vegan last but not least the just CBDs gummies now these are for those who are dead serious about CBD gummies this 3,000 milligrams jar contains about 220 gummy bears packed with thirteen point five milligrams of CBD each so if you're taking a few of these daily then this could be a really good option to buy in bulk but you don't have to stick to gummy bears they actually have quite a few different options but they all have different CBD dosage so make sure to check it in the description all right this wraps up this video on CBD gummies I hope you enjoyed it if you're thinking about buying some for yourself or for a friend just make sure to click the link in the video description you'll get the best prices and the latest deals have an amazing day", "Q6hdXt3c1wo": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be talking about CBD gummies how they help me personally it's not gonna be like a real review I'm just gonna be talking about the pros and cons for me using them and where I get them from and how much they cost and what they taste like and stuff like that so we'll just get right into it um this is the smaller jar that just CBD gummies and that is the company that I get them from I found them on Instagram my friend actually put me onto them she had ordered some I had tried it and then she got me some for Christmas which is a smaller bottle 250 milligrams and then I ended up purchasing more for myself so the 250 milligrams bottle it isn't per piece just so you're aware so you're not getting 250 milligrams per piece of candy you're actually that's actually for the whole jar and I don't have very many of these because I pretty much ate them all but these are the patrons and they are pretty good they taste just like a regular featuring the only thing I've noticed with these they do have a funky aftertaste where you kind of tell like there's something in there but either way it still tastes pretty good then I have the 500 milligram bottle and that is for the whole bottle and that is these rainbow strips and these are so good you can't even you can't even tell like there's no aftertaste like the other one they taste delicious so it says on the website I believe that one serving is two pieces of these I personally just take one so I'll kind of explain to you the CBD thing so CBD is actually derived from the how do you how do you how do you say it's like taken out of the marijuana plant but it doesn't condemn contain the THC part of it the THC part is the psychoactive part so if you've ever smoked or had never won at any time in your life you know the okay pause I just wanted to say because I realized I didn't say this but CBD is completely legal and you don't have to buy them online you could even find them probably at some of your local smoke shops but I wanted to say that it will show up on a drug test if you are on any type of probation or anything it will show up in a pee test I don't know what it shows up as but I know from personal experience that's why I'm not taking them right now so just be aware of that when you are taking these gummies you should know the difference so it doesn't give you like that - where you're just like I'm so high like I can't sit here and say I take these and then I feel high because I don't they actually just relax me and the thing that I could compare it to is probably like taking a shot of liquor like your first shot of liquor and you can kind of just feel it running through your body and like almost relaxing you that's kind of what it takes what it feels like taking these and and it just helps me sleep so I usually take one piece and that's enough to like chill me out you can take two pieces and if you take two pieces of either any of these you'll probably end up just sleeping really really deep and I've noticed and I don't know if this is just like a personal thing but when I do take two pieces I end up getting a really bad headache the next day and it was like that before when I did smoke I would get really bad headaches if I smoked too much so this is the same thing with these so yeah I just suggest taking one if you're like a lightweight or if you I don't know why I don't know why it should get rid of your headaches right but it kind of doesn't for me but I know people use CBD for anxiety headaches body pain um just a variety of things so I would suggest that you do your own research on CBD before you take any or try any you do have to be 18 years old 18 years or older to buy these things these gummies so I don't give them to my kids out of responsibility because I just don't but let me just pull up their website and tell you how much these things cost because they can get pretty pricey so this little one here that's the smallest one you can get and on their website the just CBD website and I hope you can see this pretty well it is $23.99 for that smaller bottle for this bigger bottle this bigger bottle which is 500 milligrams you're looking at 40 bucks for this personally this could probably last you a month and the reason why I say that is because I don't take them every day when I do take them I will take them like a day or two in a row then I'll take a day off of taking them and then start taking them again because your body does get used to it so after like the third day for me it doesn't really have any type of effect on me so I do take breaks when I do take them yeah so it just depends on like your body and how tolerant you are and yeah that's this would last me a month though I'm not taking them right now but when I do start taking them again it'll probably last me another month so I really do like these just CBD gummies like I said before if you want to try them you definitely should do your own personal research on CBD and everything like that there's oils there's baits there's every different types of form it's not just gummies I think gummies for me are just more pilling because it's just one and done but I really like them I just wanted to share that with you the the company I get them from is legit I ordered them I got them in like two or three days and I'll probably you know if I do reorder I'm sure I'll just go through the same company so I will leave the link down to that cup my description box [Music] but anyways those kind of just like a little video I wanted to share with you guys about CD and how it helps me yeah thanks for watching I will see you guys in my next video and if you have any questions you can comment down below and I will answer them but until next time I'll see you in the next video bye you", "3y4TTMbD2tI": "okay so the last time I was sitting here face to face with you guys I was talking about Coco dogs do you guys remember what that stuff was that was a weird chocolate like candy that kind of looked like actual little green dogs in a glass jar if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll have the link right up here in the top right kind of give you up to speed but I need you more recently I actually got something else in the mail and I want to talk to you guys about that because other than the coconuts which are actual candy this stuff you're getting that camera guy this is just CBD stuff and I actually have another packaging tube that helps matter of fact the company of this the acronyms in the name so look at that so this stuff is actual CBD infused gummy candy and unlike the last stuff that I talked about that this stuffs are actually kind of real it's not it's not just like 100% candy chocolate that's made to look like you know a green ugh the stuff in this little plastic jars actually I mean if you want to want to get technical is somewhat of a psychoactive unlike um that that chocolate stuff that I talked about before so here's the funny and ironic part about all of this you know you look at these two things these two jars full of you know it looks like simple harmless can you buy it like the supermarket and you think about the last thing I talked about which was the coconut one looks like something that you could get arrested immediately for for just having a jar on your person whereas this this stuff right here looks like something that you could waltz into any preschool and you start handing them out to kids without anyone batting a single eyeball and that's the funny part about all of this like it's just the way look how innocent this stuff looks it's crazy it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because it will in the state of Florida you got to be 21 at least from from what I recall but actually by this stuff even though it's completely harmless so we got here is uh neon poppers and everyone's favorite sour gummy worms i realistically they both taste almost exactly alike it's just they're different shapes from the shapes and sizes you can I don't know if you're getting that camera move but there are a whole bunch of little smiley faces there don't worry it on ecstasy but before I begin guys I'd be remiss to not kind of show you some one of the basics that you need just in case you guys don't really understand is where it comes from well what it's actually all about so many of you probably know about the stuff but maybe this is your first time learning about stuff like what is it I've never heard of this before CBD is that like LSD is it gonna like make me see pink elephants and ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools so let me explain really quick just exactly kind of the gist about it is got my handy-dandy whiteboard here perfectly by the way before I begin I'm not a medical expert so don't take my advice as I'm some sort of doctor or something yeah I totally left that field I mean I know I have the Asian face and everything but don't be alarmed because I definitely left the medical field I left to pursue a YouTube career where I rake in around $13 a month honestly the age of 40 is right around the corner and I still have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life so for all you outgoing recent high school graduates that are kind of freaking out about the whole real world thing and have absolutely no idea what they want to do yet don't worry cuz my book - way worse so I'd say a majority of you guys watching this video are probably more familiar with THC not too much can be said about CVD like I said earlier and there's still a common misconception about this kind of stuff especially the top of gram of certain psychoactive effects THC as everyone knows is the most active ingredient in the Disco salad this is the stuff that gets you intoxicated or is in simpler terms hi as I'm gonna do my best to try to avoid super confusing medical top of big science Awards because trust me there was a whole rabbit hole science terminology that this can all really boil down to alright so let's try to understand just exactly how THC you know gets you up there by the way before I begin try your best to not be offended by this little placemat behind here just in case you're one of those type of people basically everyone has in their bodies two types of cannabinoid receptors so let's just call these guys CB 1 and then CB 2 THC only binds to one type of cannabinoid receptor or CB so the cb1 receptors are usually found in the brain unlike the nervous system lungs liver and kidneys and the cb2 receptors are usually found somewhere in the union system there actually might be other CB receptors but that's totally not the topic here by now you probably can guess which of the two receptors THC binds to and that's actually this guy the cb1 receptor so THC see th see why not so THC is basically something that activates or stimulates that receptor and that causes like that cool rewarding effect or like that happy feeling that sometimes people get sometimes too much of it in some cases can get you was seeing like really weird like pink elephants magical dragons or like ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools and unfortunately for some people that cb1 receptor can be blocked and that euphoric feeling that many of groans so custom - just really doesn't work out for them but if you're one of the more majority lucky bunch then well Cheers now one like it's a brother ii cv receptor deals more with things like inflammation and pain management you know these can usually be found in like the gastrointestinal system and this is probably why CBD has a potential to help out people with like PTSD anxiety or other types of weird inflammation that goes on in the digestive tract or like around the body so okay let's break it down in a simpler example and this is lifted from green relief by the way they put it this way just imagine you consume cannabis and the THC and CBD are like a whole bunch of keys which are you know and searched for a lock to open those locks being the receptors these guys they click together with the proper key isn't different messages or scent you know all throughout your body so I'm like THC CBD doesn't exactly bind well with the cb1 receptor so really you kind of just almost don't really feel anything and if you really wanted to you have to take way more in the suggested limit but the worst thing that can honestly happen is like a slate rosiness or an insane state of calmness okay back to the talking Asian you really want to be careful with buying some of this stuff because a lot of the people that sell this kind of product aren't really will informing what exactly they're selling you so like last week before I actually got these things and you know the local vape store looking around for you know products that were similar the only reason I didn't is because the prices online are vastly different than what they are on stores they're actually kind of cheaper online to be honest and the stores are a little over there something like this and a store would probably cost you around 70 bucks online these things are like mid 50s or mid 60s so I walk into the store and I'm like you know I'm asking about him you know I'm asking about this type of stuff and I was asking like what's the whole thing about this almost immediately he just goes yeah bro stuff is totally worth the dude I'd like three or four of them and I was like totally gone in like five minutes dude I was I was I was surprised I was I didn't even know what to say you know before I even go in the store I kind of knew what the stuff was it wasn't well it's not exactly the most complicated thing to understand when he when he said he was gone he was like gone like with like 17 E's that's how gone there's this like his description was and I was you know I was taken aback I was no surprise you know so like three or four seconds after that there was like this like dead silence in the entire store and the only thing that I thought to myself was like dude I really hope this guy does not smoke weed because he's probably the first person that'll overdose on marijuana don't go into these stores thinking that you just found like an insane goldmine of like magical stuff because it's it's not it's not it's not that kind of stuff especially if you're in a state that still doesn't have fly solid recreationally illegal because it doesn't matter if you do that stuff and if CBD does get you like that I sure hope you don't take anything with THC unit so yeah this video is made way back in 2019 so I'm sure 10 years from now we can probably take a look at this kind of video and have a good laugh at it considering the fact like how strict the laws were on like you know this kind of stuff especially the ones regarding disco spinach because those right now even in states where it's legalized that's still federally illegal and it's classified as a schedule 1 drug okay so one of the part that probably wouldn't have you fast forwarded to the the actual product I was able consume a good amount of the bag well in the jar in the past 24 hours I didn't exactly read up on the recommended dose but I guess I should have since this was sort of a hefty sized jar at 300 milligram over 1000 1000 milligrams total so according to the little jar thing here it says that it's approximately 72 pieces you guys can read that there so thousand milligrams 72 pieces you do the math what's a thousand divided by 72 so you're looking about 14 milligrams per little candy thing well this guy this one's I think this I think there was a I think there's more gummy worms was there this had 142 pieces this is the smaller so if this stuff is still closed this has 72 gummy worms in here Oh this one had 148 smiley faces so 1000 divided by 148 okay so about 7 grams 7 milligrams of CBD and you show these little smiley face gummies usually the recommended daily doses I think it was between 15 to 25 milligrams for the stuff don't quote me on that I'm sure everyone's body chemistry is a lot different so in order to affect someone else it could vastly depend on like your size in your weight so my guess is the gummy worms here that have yet to be consumed will be a little bit stronger so I have to eat these in moderation because these guys on the other hand I kind of was just popping in like candy I forgot this was a CBD candy thing like I actually started eating them like as if there were something from like the candy aisle at Walgreens so you pop these in your mouth obviously consumer eager and they literally it's candy there's no hint of like you know when you have like the actual edible stuff from the other stuff you can get a taste of the good stuff this Kandee complete freaking candy so those a bit skeptical at first and how this helps with certain problems like anxiety and pain and you know while I didn't really have the laddering his idea was something that was pretty salient especially when driving around like the state of Florida some of you know me and the majority of my content in this channel is usually you know automotive related useless content right now while I've totally loved cars I absolutely despise driving on public roads that's that's a given fact I love cars but I hate driving and again I live in South Florida so this is kind of known as God's waiting room this is a place where older people move after they've realized that they're too old for other old people they hung out with but you know here's the thing it's not just the elderly which which are kind of terrible at driving a majority the people that drive here I feel like more than half of them have gotten their driver's license from a happy meal and because of this driving around in the state of Florida it kind of puts me on a weird edge the things I can definitely say that this stuff helps me out like like immensely I can't tell you how how much this stuff actually kind of works especially driving it gives me the nice reliable feeling that I'm not gonna get sideswiped by like a Corvette every 13 seconds anybody comes in a whole different types of forms you can get it as popcorn tinctures like something you can drop into say if you don't want any candy if you're someone that's trying to lose weight don't want to delve into the whole unhealthy candy eating process you got chips even got like CBD beef jerky and so they they put CBD and like act like a lot of things nowadays and I know this might be a totally unpopular opinion but I think edibles of anything is the most safest and best way to consume any type of whatever the help no matter what anyone says I think the whole inhalation of smoke and everything really messes with your whole body chemistry you know scarring of the tissue and the lungs and all that weird stuff so hopefully guys this was able to give you a sort of introduction of the whole alternative world of CBD let me know in the comments below it sure not only helped me but it helped anyone else that's trying to you know figure more stuff about figure out more stuff about this stuff other than that guys I got nothing else for you if you guys wanna help support my channel or visit my website it got merged stickers hats and other things literally out here calm and click everything yeah I don't I'm not a very good salesman I just had to say that at least the bare minimum I'll see you guys in the next video in the next vlog in the next whatever peace [Music]", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "S17ie9xoqGQ": "[Music] get back to the grind today I bought some candies actually bought this couple of days ago and it's been like 90 almost 100 degrees in New York and I left it in my car so you

you know follow me on social medias for now it's loud to wax", "CuS8zdDf4Ro": "hey everybody hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Ravi yoga and wellness so glad to have you joining us today we want to share a brand new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much", "iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional questions or concerns be sure to leave us a comment down below you", "p7h1qlhCdig": "what's up cbd lovers welcome to i love cbd today i'm doing a review on some cbd edibles this baby right here this is um cbd gummies it is by a company called smokies edibles um this flavor is the sour watermelon cbd gummies and this package right here contains 10 servings so each serving is pretty much like a gummy i'll show you what it looks like um here we go this is a a pretty little pinkish radish cube very tasty by the way it tastes really good um each one of these gummies contains 25 milligrams of cbd now this product is not full spectrum this is cbd isolate um cool thing about this product or the things that i like about it um first of all it says on the front it's high clarity hemp extract right here so it's high quality uh it's gluten free it's dairy free it's vegan it has no high fructose corn syrup which is good healthy you don't want to consume anything with high fructose corn syrup because that stuff is bad for you anyways um and for my concern you know i don't consume any gelatin products this does not contain indian gelatin which is rare for gummies and you know that kind of candy so that's something that's a huge plus for me because if i had gelatin i wouldn't have even tried it um ingredients uh it's got sugar corn syrup pectin dextrose citric acid sodium acetate natural artificial flavorings you know some colorings and hemp extract cbd isolate so um this is very good and you know if you're concerned about any allergies or anything this product is manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts so i always review your ingredients if you have any allergies or if you're worried about this containing anything that you may be allergic to uh but definitely for people that are concerned about uh thc they don't want to test positive for thc or they wanna they don't wanna consume anything with thc in it uh this is what you wanna go with if you're using if you wanna use cbd and not consume any thc so this has no thc in it it says right here it's isolate and each one of those gummies has 25 milligrams now the recommended dosage or the serving size listed on the package is 25 milligrams so that's what i tried out the first time however i believe my tolerance has gone up uh because i've been using some 50 milligram capsules and uh the 25 milligrams gave me like a very mild effect so i wasn't really able to judge it so i decided to take two gummies which would be 50 milligrams today and i tried it out and i definitely felt it um i felt the effects were really good i was very mentally relaxed very physically relaxed i had a little bit of strain and back pain in my lower back my pain wasn't gone but it eased my pain a bit for sure uh helped me with a little bit more mobility and you know i wasn't in pain every time i moved or sat down or got up so i definitely felt the effects uh there was some mood enhancement as well uh kind of gave me a little bit of a lift i was not sleepy at all still still awake uh i took it i think uh probably about four hours ago so i'm not not sleepy but i do feel like if when i do go to sleep i'll probably sleep good tonight and um yeah i like the stuff it tasted good i think it's a clean product um i found it online for 22.99 i will leave you guys a link in the description i'll probably put a link up here on the video somewhere uh make it easy for you if you want to check it out or if you want to try it out you could go to this website which i found and they have some pretty good deals and they have a huge selection of cbd products so i'm gonna start uh referring them uh or referring you guys to them uh in case you wanna try the products or any review that you see a product on and you wanna check it out instead of having a search and look all over the internet for it you could just find an easy link so you could go and try it out if you want to all right uh this is all i got for this one um i think i would have to give this a five stars uh five five-star rating um i think it's a good product um i also like the bag the bag has like a ziploc thing so once you open it it you know one thing i noticed is the bag wasn't sealed like i was looking to see if there was a seal or somewhere you could tear and there's nothing i was just able to open it up but it has a zip lock on it so once you open it up you could you know zip it back up and it will keep the gummies fresh so they don't get stale or dry up inside and become really hard uh so yeah five stars for these smoky edible smokies edibles um i think it's a good product i would definitely try it out especially for people that are not looking for full spectrum or like looking for thc free cbd all right i want to keep this short as possible and that's all i got for this one um i hope you guys find this video helpful or useful and if you like it give it a like if you don't it's okay it's okay it's okay maybe the next one um and if you like cbd like we do subscribe and you will stay updated with all my reviews and you probably want to hit that notification button so whenever i release a video you'll get a notification and you can check it out all right you guys i'll see you in the next video and happy cbd", "dd5eIU55KFA": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be talking about something very hmm I don't want to say controversial but I'm gonna be talking about CBD well first and foremost just as a disclaimer I want to make it very clear that if you're not over 21 this video is not for you at all vaping is not cool it's not a toy it's not a fun thing to do the only thing you should be putting in your lungs is air guys and also just like any supplement you would take I would suggest you to check with your doctor if this is safe for you specifically because everyone has a different body everyone takes different medications and a bunch of different things so definitely make sure you ask your doctor about CBD and how it might affect you and your personal health well I vape CBD this is a vape and a vapes get a lot of scrutiny and things like that like babes are like demonized now I do not vape nicotine and vaping nicotine is like vaping a cigarette basically a lot of times people who are addicted to cigarettes or addicted to nicotine or whatever they use vape systems or mods or cigarettes and things like that to help them get off of the nicotine a Vig device is a vape device that uses like coils and cotton basically the liquid that you put in here soaks up the cotton the coil heats the cotton up and produces a vapor I got a vape to specifically vape CBD and I tried this because I know other people who vape but they usually bake nicotine and I heard about CBD and vaping CBD and also how CBD can help anxiety and a bunch of other claims which I'm going to get into if you guys more like information about how much these things cost or actual information reviews about the vape then I'll let you know what I made clear is I do not condone using drugs or anything like that so definitely definitely definitely make sure anytime I'm using a drug it's under a doctor's supervision and yeah like everyone's on this go green and natural remedies and stuff like that but just like you can be naturally allergic to peanuts oh but they are a natural angry you can eat organic peanuts a natural thing and have a reaction to it so with anything natural chemical whatever what have you you always want to check with your doctor CBD is separate from THC which is hetra Hydra been a vinyl CBD is cannabidiol it is a chemical compound extracted from the cannabis plant and unlike THC it does not get you high it does not have any psychoactive effects there's different ways you can take it you can take it as a vapor you can also take it as like an aerosol like um spray in your mouth you can also take it as a like as like drops and drop it under your tongue or the side of your cheek and things like that it's all a shock of CBD and a bunch of beauty products makeup skincare lotions body care soaps a bunch of stuff like you go in a store and CBD is all over the place but let me just tell you the claims and just facts about CBD there are claims that it helps relieve pain osteoarthritis and even cancer though there are claims that it works with your brain to kind of alter serotonin having low levels of serotonin cause depression and also anxiety so I guess they claimed that CBD comes in and alters your serotonin too I guess high in the level of serotonin and regulates that for your serotonin levels to be healthier therefore helping ease anxiety the FDA does not regulate CBD so what this means is a bunch of these products in say CBD and you don't even know what amount of CBD is in it you don't even know if it's effective because you have no way to know how much in at what percentage is the is the ingredient active the best studies that I can find on CBD is tested on animals and my problem with testings on animals is that we are not animals so much studies have been done on animals that are just not up to par with the biology of a human so a lot of these testings have been inconclusive oh my personal experience with CBD is I took 600 milligrams and 1000 milligrams I had different effects with both of them and I swapped both of them out like using some here and some there it wasn't the whole month I did like one thing I don't think it helps anxiety if you guys know if you guys watch any of my other videos I do have anxiety and adjustment disorder yeah it did not help my anxiety at all the whole month I actually had an anxiety attack this month and yeah I didn't help my anxiety I don't think pretty much anyway it did help short-term pain relief like when I had my cramps during my period it did help ease the pain of the cramps like surprisingly and also you if you like work out and things like that and you get like sore muscles it definitely does help that and me at least I saw that it helped that 1000 milligrams helped more than the 600 the 600 really didn't do much of anything what I also did was suppress my appetite I noticed this while I was taking it I noticed this quickly because I always eat I love food I eat everything and anything in front of me so I really was shocked that it had that effect on me like I lost my appetite I wouldn't have an appetite and I wouldn't feel like constantly hungry all the time but don't take this as like oh yeah let me lose weight and like take the CBD no because I actually gained weight this last past month so yeah I don't think it helps you gain weight I think it might slow down your metabolism or have some type of effects on your gastrointestinal things like that now would I recommend CBD or vaping CBD or using and buying any of these products I don't think I would only because it is so expensive for not having these Bruce the results that you want like okay so 600 mgs this you can find from like $40 to 90 like 40 to 90 right but like I said the 600 doesn't really affect you that much then once you go from 1000 and up it's pretty much a hundred dollars and up like so you're paying a lot of money for a little bit of juice that only lasts you a little while because like I said the effects last about like 30 minutes it's very short-term so the amount of money you're paying for you know a little bit of pain relief is it really worth it I don't know that is up to you and your pockets the only CBD medicine that is regulated by the FDA is epi dialects which is used to treat some cases of epilepsy but even those studies are inconclusive so yeah I feel like there's a whole big CBD epidemic going on right now and I would say girl it's not like worth it like use it like I don't think it's worth it I think I would personally hold off to buy more like CBD products and stuff like that until there are more studies done and more research you know I mean it's not regulated by a third party so it doesn't confirm how much you're actually getting you might be buying one thousand and it might just be five hundred you you don't really know that is my thoughts on vaping CBD that is my personal experience thank you guys so much for watching if you've ever tried CBD CBD Lotion CBD Baum CBD anything comment down below and let me know your experience thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time [Music]", "wG2DiEJrx34": "cvd approved episode three today we're talking wild gummies you guys I am obsessed with these

same dosage per gummy it's 25 milligrams per gummy which is a really that's a decent amount of CBD you're gonna get like that's a good dosage you're not gonna get so much CBD that you're gonna feel like tired and lethargic but you're gonna feel it like I said I I love taking this when I go like on hikes because my muscles by the end of the hike I don't even feel like you know tired and like

[Music] what's up guys it's your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaco TV where you watch decide and vape and as said earlier I've got some gummy bears today but they have the extra added benefit of having some CBD you know alright these things are pretty good I've gotten I just because I got this right here doesn't mean I didn't get extras in it doesn't mean I haven't been eating these things are the bomb let me tell you but before we get into that let's go ahead and check out the packaging and then we'll go to the fun stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you get some do yourself a favor check the description below all right in the description gonna final link to these click the button a couple times put some in your cart put some on your doorstep and you can have some gummy bear enjoyment just like I do um with these I'm not gonna lie there's a whole lot of things that you can say and you can't say about CBD because obviously like we covered the FDA hasn't approved of anything but let me tell you what they do for me what they do for me I'll leave these at night right before bed like a half hour hour before bed somewhere around there I'm out like a light I sleep I mean I'm out I used to be the guy who tossed and turn to go to bed sit there flip through my phone for you know an hour or two no I go right to bed I also have a day job believe it or not this isn't the only gig work at a warehouse I walk around a lot a lot a lot and with all that walking around you know I got aches and pains these these help with the aches and pains okay um and that's that's personal experience that's just me telling you again the FDA didn't doesn't say that's what it will do what it won't - etc etc I'm just telling you from personal experience so again check the description below you're gonna find a link delivered directly to the product get yourself something all right trust me get yourself something just try it do yourself a favor and just try so until next time it needs your boy big J for VAP code TV where you watch decide invade get you some gummy bears and until then I am out [Music]", "rzbB3JdTIjg": "[Music] hey guys what's going on i'm dylan from experience vapes and today we have quite a few new exciting products to take a look at so without further ado let's just jump into it first off we're going to start off with the air factory cbd vape juice now originally we started with the koi vape juice then we went to the naked cbd vape juice and now we're on to the air factory cbd vape juice these guys are brand new i just got them in yesterday so i can't be certain but i'm almost positive these guys are infused with terpenes for example the melon lush and the mystery both have relaxation effects so those are going to be more indica heavy i believe those have some indica terpenes added to them and the blue razz as well as the berry rush have more stimulating effects um more energy boosting things like that so they're going to be more of a sativa dominant or a sativa terpene added moving on from there we have the just cbd and i've been blown away by this product i really love their gummies their gummies come in anywhere from 250 milligrams 1 000 milligrams all the way up to the party pack which is a 3 000 milligram they come in the sour gummy worms sour bears uh the rainbow strips cherries watermelon rings apple rings we have so many different flavors for these guys and the just cbd is hemp infused so that cbd is going to be baked right into the gummy it's not like all of your cds on that sugary uh coating on the outside that all falls to the bottom of the bag anyway this is a way higher quality product of cbd gummy um keeping with that the just cbd cartridges are also phenomenal those guys are going to be 200 milligrams per cartridge and they come in a variety of different flavors they come in watermelon strawberry honey as well as a vanilla flavor and with that that is going to wrap up our new look at the new cbd products we just got in the air factory cbd vape juice the just cbd cartridges and just cbd gummies we do have a large stock of the gummies but everything else it is going to be selling out fast so if you do want to get your hands on them you have to stop in today and see me at experience vapes", "pWYu7jNaeAk": "hey guys welcome back to another CBD video here on East Coast cream today I'm going to be introducing some exciting products to you by reviewing CBD FX I have CBD gummies to tinctures and what is called a chill shot there's so much I could say about this company right off the bat the amount of information they have on the products is seriously great I've been using an oil for a while that has almost no information about the extract contents on their website and I noticed a complete difference when taking an oil that has information on it versus an oil that doesn't the consistency is just there in comparison I do have a coupon code for you guys so make sure to stick around to the end I will be mentioning it and you can get 15% off if you end up liking what you hear definitely worth it my opinion so let's get into it so the first thing I want to talk about are the gummies these are like the best thing ever there are 60 of them in a bottle they are vegan and gluten free and have very simple ingredients which I love highly processed foods are so horrible for anxiety to begin with so I was really excited when I saw that this product barely had anything in it they have 5 milligrams of CBD per gummy and the serving size is 2 the label is super informative it tells you pretty much everything you need to know about this product before you ingest it there's even nutritional contents about the fat carbs and sugar which is the first time I've ever seen that on a CBD product they have it on the textures as well which is great I love the packaging I love how simple everything is pretty much just have everything you need to know on the packaging and that is it these are delicious absolutely love them the texture is great they have like sugar coating on the outside they've just like really good treat the two tinctures I have are the plus 1000 series in a hemp plus 1500 series these 2 teachers are completely unflavored so the only two ingredients you have in these are MCT oils and CBD rich hemp oils like I said before this has the calories and the fat content it even has directions a lot of people get confused about how much these bottles recommend this bottle says serving size one dropper which is the equivalent to one milliliter which is what most other bottles say so it's a little bit more user friendly in the instructions the flavor since it is unflavored is compared to other like waxes or concentrates that I've tried before so I do need a chaser for these though I don't prefer the flavor there is something sort of natural and refreshing about taking just a raw hemp extract yeah she's very earthy tasting and kind of bitter but I do enjoy it on some level after reading about the chill shot I realized how supplement and nutrient oriented this company is the chill shot has l-theanine in it which is an extremely important amino acid along with all the naturally occurring terpenes and fatty acids that come with the 220 milligrams of hemp extract 20 milligrams of CBD and a few other ingredients to make the lemonade I like how all the products state how much have oil is in it versus how much CBD oil is in it because those two things are not synonymous just because you have 200 milligrams or so whatever of hep extract does not mean you have 200 milligrams of CBD the flavor was a little strong for my liking so I mixed it with some water and it was perfect there's even a lab report for this as well which states that there's no THC in it so from that I known to take it during the day when I take CBD oils with no THC I get a very energized 2-foot was feeling and that's how I felt when I took this I felt very focused and very um not a DD ish sorry so if you guys were interested and wanted to get 15% off the coupon code I have for you is just East Coast create 15 I just want to thank CBD FX for sending me their products I think they're amazing and I mean the fact that they're obviously a customer oriented company I really like from the simple ingredients and the user-friendly packaging all the variety of things that they sell to I can tell they're a very moral and ethical company and that is something I look for when shopping for any product so it's really nice to see that in a CBD product so that's all I've got for today and I will catch you guys for the next one [Music]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their

minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy

please help me get there that'll be cool so on that note i have also this is what i got for myself this is a cbd vape pen this is a higher milligram dosage this was more money this was much more money okay so this is the vape pen i believe it says and this is the bubble gum honey bubble gum flavor pure and clear so i got this because it doesn't have like all those types of i don't know explain it it says no pg or vg that's a type of ingredient they use that's supposed to be not good for you and i heard so i don't know i just got this this is organic hemp slim and lightweight adjustable heap settings preheat functions vape pen hemp oil concentrate cannabis derived tested pure blah blah blah mind body spirit fast acting really so this is 250 milligrams and this is 200 milligrams this is not bad for 20 200 milligrams for like 500 puffs or something i said i don't know but this is 250 milligrams what does it mean to experience pure spectrum enlightenment intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "4waBpmEubaA": "next to my channel it is jasmine queen again and today we're going to be talking about these cbd gummies that i purchased from just cbd yep i'm sure you guys heard of them if not they are an actual legit website that you can get cbd from not just gummies but oils and everything just go look for yourself it's called just cbd and i'll put a link in the description for you guys if you want to try them out can we talk about my baby hairs real quick like they really try to shine on their own right now so i just wanted to give them a shout out since they want to be scene anyways back to what i was talking about these gummies were 12.99 and i got the smaller container the smaller jar they do have bigger jars but this jar total um all together with gummies it's 250 milligrams and there's 18 gummies gummies aren't 250 each it's literally i want to say let's see if it tells i'm going to put it in the description if i'm wrong but i think it's about 11 milligrams um and this is just the the gummies that i chose there's other gummies to choose from this is the rainbow i'm kind which they call the ribbon gummies and they're just like rainbow and it's a really good flavor to them yeah they're not nasty at all they're really good flavor it tastes like gummies like it literally tastes like a gummy bear that i bought from the store um they have other flavors though if you don't want the regular they have so many flavors to choose from the peach rings and watermelon and the apple and blueberry and all those other flavors and gummy bears and things like that so you can choose what you want these are just the ones that i chose and they are gluten free which is really good for those of you trying to stay away from gluten and it says let me tell you why i got these so i got these really because for one i work on a computer all day long like i'm looking at a computer screen all day long for just about nine hours a day and then for work and then i'm in grad school and you know school is online now and i literally get out of get off of work and log into another computer for school um for school and that's an extra three hours and i'm just looking at a computer screen so i get really bad migraines i already got migraines before that but like it's been worse and then school and work it just looks like a lot of stress and just really kicking up my anxiety like sometimes i might i just can't even sleep like because my mind is steady running and so i got these because i looked at reviews and people said um cbd really helps with the anxiety and i don't have to worry about getting high because they have thc and it's just like the hemp plant basically that they used to make marijuana but they take the thc out so you don't get high so not a person who um smoke i like to get high and then i suggest cbd and it's really healthy it's like just a healthy alternative i'm not saying smoking is bad smoking is not unhealthy just i just don't like to get high it's not my thing and so i got the if they will work for me and my anxiety um so the suggested use is to take one gummy every six hours which i don't i mean i'm not saying don't do that but if you need to maybe you could try i don't feel like i need to do that um i just was like i'm gonna take it like before bed or like before i get in the shower at night um so the first night i took it i actually went to sleep like right away i'm not even gonna lie i'm like what's the next day i was thinking like wow did that just knock me out like did it make me tired that's so crazy and i literally wasn't even tired like i just it literally calmed me and i went to sleep and i only took one and i know some people say they take two but i had took one again i'm a really small person so i don't know if that may have affected it or not so i took it again a few more times and remember i was only taking one before bed i do think you should um take like two or one and a half which i did last night i took one and a half and it worked again like it knocked me out i put on travelers on netflix and relax after i took it and i really never went to sleep and so it did help and i also was getting a migraine and it stopped it like my microphone didn't even come but i felt it coming so i think these do work just really depending on like if you're training your mind right if you're gonna take it knowing that you're gonna sit down and let it kick in and relax i think it will work but if you're like racing and working out and schooling your laptop your mind is like i don't know it may not me it may or may not work maybe you should take two um to see so um let me show you guys what it looks like so here's what the bottle looks like this is a smaller container and the smaller one comes with 18 assorted fruit um flavors so again it's rainbow so they're different flavors there's blueberry it's a blueberry rest a blue raspberry a tutti fruity a strawberry and a green apple so they're mixed together and this is a jar very simple it comes with plastic on top and this is what the gummy looks like it's rainbow it's like the little sugar around it and i'm going to take her because they're good and also because i stopped working to record this video and i have like a little migraine coming again and so and lay down and hopefully it kicks in i think i'm gonna take a half one i'm gonna take the other half one that i took last night that i put back in here so i took one and a half remember i said the one and a half did work for me so hopefully it works again but yeah i just wanted to give you guys i just want to give you guys some info on these dvd gummies i might try one from the calm website and see how they go and then i'll let you guys know how those gummies taste and how if they work for me or not i do have the oil from calm and i'll do a review on that as well i'll leave some info in the description below for you guys but i hope hopefully this was helpful i hope you guys like this video yes i'm sitting on the floor um enjoy your day stay safe [Music] you", "TFJV1E6wor4": "checking out CVD FX thousand milligram CBD and that fruity cereal flavor alright before we get into this I kind of want to show you guys something here let's see so I just took the lid off something that was kind of confusing to me here I'm not sure if you guys can see but at the top here it's kind of like crystallized and I've honestly tried shaking it out for quite some time and there's just a bunch of these little clumps that have built up around the perimeter of the bottle and of course the top it's kind of just crystallized you can see that no matter how much I shake it like I said I've been shaking it for like 10 minutes it just stays there nonetheless well I'm not sure if that'll affect the the the result here but let's go ahead and check it out today I'll be using a Trinity alpha the Trinity off has three different tip settings so these three different little dots here kind of changed the temperature I guess the waters your voltage I'm not too sure but change the like harshness of the hit so firstly I'm gonna be starting off on the soft it and I'll kind of let you guys know on the flavouring that I'm getting and anything else I know this so let's go ahead and try it out yeah so has like a really creamy consistency if you can see inside of here this is a little pod system with that Trinity alpha you can kind of see some of these little like chunks in there as well which I'm not sure if that's if it's supposed to be like that maybe because it's a higher concentration of CBD maybe it clumps up nonetheless I'm getting a good flavor here yeah I'm definitely getting that fruity cereal definitely that creaminess of the milk it's definitely really good one of the better ones I've had see that's more of my little tank here and I'm gonna go ahead and bump it up one of the temperatures here so now we're gonna be at that medium temps heading you don't let you guys know yeah and I'm a Trinity off I'm using a mesh coil so it provides that best flavor that you can get with the Trinity alpha so there you don't really get any throw hit so that's what you're after this is definitely not the juice for you it tastes really good guys okay really good I don't typically vape very often my favorite one so far is is called my favorite vape flavoring so well maybe until this one I have to baby a couple more times but it's candy keen peachy rings it's a PG rain flavoring and that one's it's out of here it's good that's a good flavor profile only thing I've noticed as I've started a babe a little bit more often and maybe it comes out of my modest I don't really get a really bold flavor it's always very light and I get that I am vaping it it's not like I'm actually eating peach rings or fruity cereal but it's definitely a lighter flavor than what I what I would anticipate a lot of people claim it's like really potent are really bold flavor but I'm not I'm not really getting that not to say it's bad definitely one of the best best babies I've had or but best he juices yeah you know what guys this might actually be my new favorite flavor and you're getting that thousand milligrams definitely really good normal price on this guy is $75 right now due to the whole Quran a virus issue I know they're kind of trying to help people out there I know they they have an ongoing promotion on CB d FX comm where medical professionals and bunch of other people that are helping us out during this pandemic here they're offering twenty twenty percent off for those individuals however currently I believe they have an ongoing sale right now where it's twenty five percent off of everything so you can please secure some pretty good deals there not only that I think that though an enzyme hand sanitizer or something like that which is pretty neat Ben you get thirty milliliters of the liquid not a massive bottle by any means so if you were paying seventy seventy-five dollars for it every time if they get pretty expensive but you know it does have a thousand milligrams of CBD in it which you know I from what I've heard is pretty tough to come by that high of concentration of CBD in there definitely a really good flavor profile guys it honestly tastes like fruit loops or fruity pebbles you know you also don't miss out on that dairy flavor too so I know a lot of people are really really interested in those dairy flavorings and this is definitely for you guys even if you want more of that fruity pebbles that Froot Loops kind of flavor profile this is definitely it as well initially it was crackling pretty heavily it still is I was getting some of the drops in my mouth I was kind of flying up but nonetheless great plate flavor profiler I'm gonna go ahead and bump it up to the the hard the harder hit and really good vapor production and glowing eyes now I can't 100% attest to the effects on this I have to admit that I definitely feel a little bit more relaxed and you know it could be a placebo type deal but I don't know whenever you're looking at a thousand milligrams of CBD you know it very well could be you know legitimate effects there in terms of me feeling more relaxed but yeah thousand milligrams of CBD from CBI ethics I don't currently have a rating scale on my youtube channel yet but if I had to kind of break this down here for the price if you're paying $75 for this which keep in mind there are a number of resellers that's all I had to leave sometimes you can find it cheaper so definitely just do your homework there matter of fact if I see anything I'll go ahead and link it down below like I said CBD FX is currently running that 25 percent off but I don't know how long that's gonna be going on for so keeping in mind that price you know it is very expensive I know you can buy teachers for for maybe half the cost of this at that are thousand milligrams sometimes even more but when you're when you're keeping you in consideration that this is a vape and it's meant to be baked I've seen some people try to use teachers that sort of thing a lot of those contain MCT you oils and stuff you really don't want to be putting in your lungs so so something that's pre-made for you you know it's not a terrible deal especially when you're factoring and they give it cheaper than that seventy-five bucks so for value you know I probably give it a four out of five flavor profile is great it's phenomenal effects like I said I I feel a little bit more relaxed i I don't know if it's because of that or if it's just placebo but nonetheless it's great for like guys I'd recommend checking it out if you like those cereal flavors this might be for you they have a number of other ones I know they have a blueberry one that's been pretty popular so for flavor profiles this might be the new thing for you guys and if you want those more natural terpenes they have those new additions on the website as well nonetheless guys thanks for checking out my channel here at cloud check appreciate you guys watching if you guys have any questions comments concerns just go and leave them down below and we'll see you guys in the next video take care",

probably at the our point right now you guys I'm just not feeling good I'm almost really kind of nauseous right now I shouldn't drink that much it was better when I just sipped on it throughout my day

help you make sense of your dispensary smokey out uh it's quite smoky out here in southern california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you

way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "mE1FUx5rhII": "ah my neighbors are so loud all right anyway hey guys welcome back to my channel but yeah hey welcome back guys so for today's video we are going to be doing a product line review oh let me get my notes hold on uh so today we're gonna be reviewing and going over slash demoing four products and that was eight to four products it's from a cbd line called hemp base they reached out to me a little over a month ago maybe two now to try out a couple products from their line let me just show you the products right now so they sent me two of their milk cbd oils this one is in this flavor cream soda and this is in cherry amaretto i have more of the amaretto leftover than i have the cream soda i'm pretty much almost done with this one it's delicious i'll get to that in a second then they're cbd vegan and gluten free gummies this comes with 30 gummies and there's 25 milligrams of cbd per serving and then lastly is their lemon up am disposable vape pen and they have a couple other flavors i saw on their website some are supposed to be more relaxing and have different effects depending on the essential oils that they use in the formula so for those of you who have never tried cbd products before cbd is the chemical compound found in cannabis but it is non-psychoactive so it's not the same as thc it's not going to get you high it's legal now pretty much everywhere and has been proven to have medical benefits so they are able to send these out without it being only strictly to a legalized state like here in colorado or california or any of the other states on the east coast that are but cbd really anybody can buy in america at least from my knowledge so cbd is one of those things that it really it does a lot of different things so it's anti-inflammatory it helps soothe it's relaxing calming supposed to help with pain due to its anti-inflammatory properties so i mean there's a lot of different things that it does hold on sure you guys have seen it popping up everywhere on social media in skin care food supplements it's everywhere now cbd is the hot thing along with adaptogens and a lot of other trends that are currently trending so i being a weed smoker as well so i use um marijuana products that contain thc and cbd thc being the psychoactive compound i guess i have a little bit of a warped expectation of what cbd is going to do versus someone who is going right off the bat and trying cbd for the first time and having no experience having no past experience with thc you don't get the same effect it's not going to necessarily alter your mood anyway it's going to more so do or benefit you over time so with the oil in particular the very first time that i use these literally nothing happened i didn't notice a change in my sleep or my mood but after i got through a little bit more almost a quarter through the bottle is when i started noticing when i was waking up i didn't have as much pain in my neck my dreams were a little bit weird and that is one of the things that can happen with these types of ingredients and not even marijuana derived ingredients like valerian root can give you weird dreams magnesium sometimes can as well skull cap extract can give you weird dreams there's just there's a lot of other things that can so it's not necessarily something you have to be wary about if you've ever taken a sleepy time herbal tea you might have experienced the same thing but that did happen with me i had some weird dreams in the beginning and as i adjusted and started incorporating into my daily routine i wasn't experiencing that anymore outside of the normal weirdness that my dreams normally are they're they're messed up um yes you get about 30 doses in here as well there's 250 milligrams of um cbd infused in the entire bottle and you are supposed to take one full dropper or hold it for 15 to 30 seconds sublingually which means under your tongue before swallowing and you do really want to make sure that you're doing this because the underside of our tongue is where we have a lot of blood receptors and a lot of the time for medicines especially in like film strip form you'll put under your tongue to dissolve orange cream is a favorite it's honestly delicious it tastes so good it's hard to do just one dropper full but there's no harm in doing more than one honestly i'll be i'll admit i've done probably three or four before when i really needed to knock out and me saying that doesn't mean it's gonna make you groggy and just zonk out you will not in any way be incapacitated it's just gonna kind of calm you get you a little bit less fast-paced brain that sounds like it's it's sedating it's not it's relaxing cherry amaretto i think they use the same cbd derivative for all of their products except for maybe the vape pens which might be a little bit different um but the cherry amaretto same effects doesn't really affect my dreams as much anymore the only thing is i just don't like cherries so there's a lot of this left so probably i don't know incorporate it into desserts or something i don't know if you are a cherry amaretto lover you should check this out second to last but certainly not least are the vegan gluten-free gummies these are really enjoyed so being a colorado resident i have the ability and honestly the luxury and privilege to go into a dispensary and pick out different types of gummies whether they be thc or cbd based or a hybrid of both this was an area that i'm pretty versed and familiar with and these honestly blew my mind considering the fact that they do not have any gelatin in them they are very very akin to sour patch kids in texture they they really you would not know that these are vegan nor would you know that they're not from a candy company they taste so good they're delicious and i think the delivery system of having it in a gummy and having a dissolve over time makes these a little bit more suitable for the day i like having one of these like right when i wake up just to calm me down get me ready for my day and get me in a better mood whereas the drops are very concentrated they're sublingual it absorbs like it absorbs interpolation very quickly so those you wouldn't necessarily want to take them in the morning i really like them the flavors are great so these are the flavors it's a green orange a dark red and there was a pink but i think i ate all of those and the flavors are raspberry strawberry mango and lemon lime so i've ate in all the raspberry last but certainly not like i said i think i said that about the last thing whatever is the hemp base cbd lemon up disposable vape pen so i had a really glowing review for all the other products this is kind of where it goes a little bit downhill for me is more so an ethical reason not necessarily the efficacy of the product it works well vaping delivers those chemicals to your brain very quickly into your bloodstream so it is a really effective way to just get your little pick me up and i love that this is a lemon scent and they designated it for morning use i've been using it at night and it's fine it's not like it's gonna have caffeine or nicotine it's going to make you like more hyper and not able to sleep so you totally can use this at the night in the night time if you prefer but the one thing i have an issue with is the packaging and the fact that this is disposable i would really appreciate a rechargeable battery and then cartridges that can be repurchased or even liquid that can refill those cartridges so it's a little bit less single use packaging is really cute i would i honestly totally would have been fine having it in a just standard cardboard unicorn without having the foam padding i do get it it is a really nice element it's very apple-esque for being a cbd and natural-based company that is vegan i really would have appreciated to see more eco-conscious packaging packaging it came in was quite equal kind of like there wasn't styrofoam peanuts or anything like that but this particular thing i just wish even better packaging and that these weren't single use and disposable once you're done with them because these are mixed material they have this kind of pseudo plastic paper uh wrapping around the component and from the vape pens i've owned from my other cartridges there's a heating element there's a different type of pipe that runs through the entire length of device for air intake and then there's another type of plastic for this another type of plastic for the led so you can't recycle these they just go to landfill and that's it but basically you just pull on it for a few seconds the little light will [Music] illuminate i got a couple um it's much easier to do that with a hookah and not these but anyway so let me just go over pricing really quick before i wrap up this video and give my final thought or the vape pens uh the lemon up was actually on sale from 25 to 18 it seemed to be the only one that was on sale the other ones remain at a 25 price point the orange and the amaretto cream uh cbd oils were 15 but again as i mentioned the amaretto is sold out currently but the orange cream is on sale for 13. and then the vegan gluten-free gummies which are a 30 count bottle are 35 currently on sale for 30. i unfortunately don't have an affiliate or discount code for you guys this is not a sponsored video they just asked me to try these products out so giving my honest review and again that's why i was a little bit negative about the packaging and whatnot i think the price point is great i really like the brand message i think cbd needs to be more widely explored by a lot of people it does help a lot of issues that you might otherwise have just been prescribed something for whereas this is a better and not addictive alternative but so yeah for my final thoughts i love cbd i think it's a great ingredient you guys should definitely try it out if you have not i love the line i think it's really effective they do a high quality source cbd you don't have that really very distinct plant taste after eating or using any of the product especially the vape and vape cbds have a very they're not as pleasant to inhale as a just normal thc pen so i appreciate that they were able to formulate it in such a way that makes it more pleasant experience for the customer my only downfall again is the packaging and then i didn't personally necessarily see there was a lot of adjectives i didn't necessarily see a huge difference in my mood for myself so a lot of the time people will use cbd for depression or anxiety and it didn't really help me without it it was more of a sleep aid for my um usage and that's actually okay so maybe that's not negative but yeah guys that concludes this video if you are interested in headbase please check them out i'll link them down below in the description bar and if you're new to my channel please subscribe and hit the bell give a like and that's about it i'm gonna film another video in a second because

primo vape card and we found a couple companies that are that are competing for the top spot and um so in the future uh you guys will know what we're doing all right so moving on from that in the past uh just so you guys know uh i really like these gummies um uh from from hemp lively but i have dissolved my relationship with them um they are uh moving in a different direction than than what i uh intended um or actually we're not gonna debate those two sides to every story but it boils down to um they're doing a giveaway over at implied police youtube channel i've done all their videos up to this point but i'm not going to be doing their videos anymore however they are giving away at some of these on easter so if you guys want to go there and check it out you can click on the link in the description and it'll take you to a spot you can enter email in and you can win a tub of these on easter sunday i personally won't be doing any more advertising work for them um me and the owner have dissolved our relationship on that but that doesn't mean that they don't have a really truly great product out there i really am happy about these these are uh delta htc whole plant hemp infused gummies a lot of these uh gummy companies out there are spraying these gummies y'all um but just because i don't uh agree with that you know the way they're advertising and the direction they want to go with their company doesn't mean that they don't have a great product um but having said that i i personally won't be um you know doing any more videos for them or anything like that you can still i i believe that you can still use whatever 20. if you have a question about that you can call david mcginnis he's on the hemp lively website over there and you guys can take a look at their stuff if you guys choose to buy from them in the future um i i won't be associated with them at all um i will uh maybe uh still keep some of their gummies on my site we did create a vape card over there that's taking a long time to come out i'm not sure what's going on in there i really um you know being on the internal um workings of lively itself you know you would think that i had a little bit more uh pull or say in what's going on uh they're really dragging their feet on the vape card that we created i'm not sure what the deal is with that because it's a really good vape card i should just go ahead and come out with it but barring that i'm not sure if i'll have them on my site um and i'm and i'm not 100 sure that i will have him lively gummies on my site um but if i have a stock of them i will put them on the site you no longer get them bought up and then i'll make a decision at that point uh you know from you viewers if uh whether you know whether you'd like to see the uh imply these gummies on my website or not uh moving on from that uh talking about this uh grand eddie perps that i got from a gift from nature cbd you know that m a smoke shop down there in thomasville uh you know way back when i first started it's not way back you know a few months ago when i first started this youtube channel i didn't know anything about delta 8 and surely didn't know anything about uh videos you know up until that point i had never really even liked anybody taking my picture uh but i had found some relief finally and so i went off down to you know thomasville i've known mr spewed for a while and i get talking to her you know i was just spouting off about nothing happy that i found relief so she goes online and she finds you know from her distributor what they're distributing is she puts those in her shop and then i go back down there a couple weeks later and obviously by then we've talked about delta farms and legal buzz and stuff like that we found them and so i went in there um and talked to her about that and some reviews on her product now you'll notice that this uh granddaddy perps uh vape cart has 35.99 cents on it and that's kind of what the you know the idea of this location is that we're sitting in right now now um i haven't been able to do anything this week on it but the goal of this of this shop is it'll be open for people to walk in the door but the majority of my work should be done right here in this office right in the back i'll see my videos back here and back i'll be doing some online marketing for other companies that that need it local and obviously in the cbd realm and then i'll be shipping vape cards out the back and obviously um you know hopefully a distributor uh truck that we can put on the road and possibly get these trucks to these local shops out there and for you folks out there that want uh bait parts you know in stores near you we don't know what's going to happen with this vape with this vape hand coming on you guys can contact me through the eric whatever guys shop.com or whatever guys shop at gmail.com and i can get you wholesale accounts to all these companies that we think are the best and we can get these and you have a store near you that is looking at these products and stuff like that and you'd like to get them give them my name man send them over and i'll get them a wholesale account and you know if they're close enough i'll drive to them but i'll find a way to get uh vape cars to that store one way or another shipping ban or not and if i have to drive them over there myself for you guys to get because that's kind of the goal of this is and to let people know that we can get uh quality vape cards at a good quality price like i said before she's got this one at 35.99 if you go down into the smoke shop right now walk in the door you can buy anything that vape supply sells any vape cart they sell for thirty dollars and then for 34.99 excuse me and that includes those combo carts that you know that they have such a high price on on vapor supplies you can actually buy those combo carts cheaper in the store than you can on the vapeholdsupply.com website or on my website for that matter um and so that just goes to show you that a lot of times the stores and the gas stations that you guys are going in it's got delta a they're kind of limited to whatever the distributor is bringing off that truck and that distributor he doesn't know anything about deltae he doesn't know anything about cbd and really all he's looking for is a mass uh produced product and usually that comes in a price floor quality and that's kind of what we're trying to avoid here hopefully you folks will know when you walk into a store and you see something like this for 35.99 um and you see a delta farms card for 34.99 that you will gravitate towards the 34.99 card you take that baby cart that i had the other day that baby car had all the right packaging had everything it was supposed to have on it but it was like sucking on air man it was a waste of 28 and i wish i could have taken my money back but the the good thing about that is that you guys watch that video and you know the next time you walk in there and you see a delta farms cart on the wall or you see and you see that baby cart on the wall that you will gravitate more towards the delta farms car personally uh this car's at 35.99 it wouldn't matter to me if she had those delta farms card at 45.99 now that i know i would still buy the delta farms cart moving on to this granite perk uh it's provided by a gift from nature cbd they are i'm not sure exactly i've looked for their site they've actually got a website out there you can look it up it's a gift from naturecbd.com and you can see these uh carts um i don't rep for them at all but i'm gonna give you guys just a quick review on the card itself um i talked to you guys about this cart before i don't know if you can see but um the cart if you can see it it starts to run like the viscosity of the cart is not quite as thick as other carts that i've gotten and that's not because the temperature in here is all that um hot or warm it's actually you know a little bit chilly in here you can see my uh jacket on but you'll notice that this cart is running like the other carts you know when you hold them up it takes a long time before they they switch over this one's a little bit cold right now but i'm telling you right now when it's at room temperature this this car runs and you can see it i don't know if you guys notice i'm just going to hold it there for a second so you guys can see with my hand behind it and you can see the you know just the the fluid in the cart just running down uh relatively quick uh the viscosity is just not not what i've seen in other carts you look uh at the color of the card itself it's got a nice gold tint uh the tip as you can see it's got a really big hole in it which really allows for a lot of air to come through but i will tell you this i've coughed more i'm not even going to pull in this cart right now because i've coughed more on this cart than i've that i've caught on any car that i've ever had i'm not sure what the deal is with that i'm not sure why uh as you can see you know i'm holding over again and you can just see that fluid just sliding over um i've pulled through this before um the effects are probably about a seven you actually do get a little bit of a buzz off this this is a it's got in it's also got like a not a grand daddy per flavor to it it's more like a grape uh flavor to it i'm not quite sure they were going with that um because i've tasted granddaddy purse before and none of them have tasted like this i don't know if i just got a bad batch of what the deal is i don't even want to smoke the cart uh like i said because i i just you know it's runny and then of course i don't know what you know i checked the coas but maybe i got a bad batch or something you know i'm hoping i went down there the other day to mma smoke shop i grabbed another granddaddy purpose off the shelf uh held it over to the side and it ran the same way so i don't know if it's just a bad batch all the way through with what she got but i wouldn't recommend this card to anybody um i'm not you know i don't even want to pull on it right now to show you guys how much i was coughing up this give me such a migraine uh from coughing off this card and so you know that mango cush i actually got from a gift from nature cbd i think i told you guys about that before that was the very first cart that i got of this brand um and before i got out of thomasville i knew i had a good cart but the carts that i've tried since then they just haven't equalled up to the mango kush and obviously the mango cush doesn't run anywhere like this one and obviously it had a little bit a little bit different color to it too i you know usually when i go into uh those vape stores and stuff like that or smoke shops a lot of times i'll gravitate towards a cart that has a little bit darker tint on it excuse me and uh and that's kind of what that boils down to i ended up getting the mango kush first and that was a really good hit but the granddaddy perps man it's just it's it's lacking in every step of the way it does have some effects to it um something that you can work with all day long i would assume that you know if it was the only cart on the wall that you could get this and you'd be you know you'd be okay but you just be coughing balls man hey folks whatever guys signing off i told you guys you stuck around the end i'll tell you how you can win a brand new veg car flavor of your choice from over a blue moon hip company you can go over there and check them out at bluemoonhip.com or whatevergoshtop.com you'll need to check out flavors uh barring that on st patrick's day computer's going to pick a winner you'll need to give me your address and uh blue moon hip company will send this cart straight out to you hey folks it's the end of the week and i'm glad man because like i haven't got anything done this week and it's really been a crappy weekend and i i'm really glad this friday i hope everybody's had a better week than i have um and i hope next week is going to be way better hey folks whatever got signed off because what are me and i love you guys see ya", "Io-UKjDB0mk": "[Music] everyone so this is gonna be a quick unboxing slash mini review video of some of these cool super the effects products though that we've got here and so this is the vape kit and this is the oil that goes with the vape kit first thing right off the bat this is actually very compact like you look at the size compared to my keys very compact so let's just jump in here open that up ok so I went ahead and got all that opened up so the packaging is actually quite nice this kind of just opens like that and like I said it's super compact so this is the oil that you get a nice dripper bottle and I mean compare those two to my keys that that's that's very very small now before we do anything you're gonna charge the battery on this because they don't come pre charged at least this one did so this is just a simple charger and this is I believe it's USB because it has a USB sign right but that looks like a weird-looking USB thing but that's kind of cool now that that's all charged up and you'll know when you're charging it if the light is blue that means the voltage is good enough to go to vape if it's red that means you need to leave it to be charged more so mine was blue so the way you turn it on now is you need to click the button five times and then it'll light up just like that now it's on so if you were to press it's activating and to turn it off again you press the button five times and let's move on so the cartridge it's very simple it has a indicator for you one mill right there which turns out to be about one drop this actually has a child's lock or whatever you want to call it on it you can't really see that but you need to push down and twist and it opens so we're just going to put that in there make sure not to go past that one mil mark I think about on there for you and actually I so just to go a little below that just for safety because when you're sticking this thing in all that oil is gonna rise up and you don't want any just spill over so perfect there's your cartridge full of oil looks good next next you're gonna want to take out these connectors just need one of the two so this will screw on there like that that simply goes in there it's got a little rubber stopper at the mouthpiece get rid of that and you're all set so let's give it a try that's actually quite nice it has a little bit of a flavor nothing too crazy powerful but it just kind of smells kind of smells like essential oils almost Pleasant smell Pleasant taste yeah very nice that fits in the palm of your hand do you carry this anywhere pretty cool all right now let's move on and do a little comparison with the disposable pen that they have it's very sleek looking kind of a metallic shine to it looks kind of cool actually I like the color another little stopper so I guess that's and you just go out it yep so this is the fresh menthol and mint flavor there's actually quite nice you can see here let me try to get that on the frame with those light up while you're smoking it so that does hit quite nice actually let's compare it to the kit I would say in terms of hit strength they're actually fairly consistent but again the major advantage you're getting with this kit is that it's refillable and all you have to buy is these oil oil drops and these disposable ones they last you a little bit depending on how much you be but they go in the garbage and you have to buy another one so I would definitely recommend if you're going to give these products a try maybe start with the disposable see how you like this one then if you like it definitely try these out because I mean look in terms of size we're not talking that much of a sacrifice you can use this for months and months and months save yourself some money and yeah so that's been a quick unboxing guys hope you enjoyed stay tuned we'll be having more content like this released shortly", "4RaUcRi5Nzk": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing a review video I haven't done one of these in quite a while but I um discovered some new products and I wanted to tell you guys about them and give you a little bit more information because I feel like surrounding this topic there is some misinformation so I just wanted to kind of talk about how I like them where I got them and what it's all about so I recently purchased some new products and it's called just CBD I got the Valentine's Day limited edition it's just like heart-shaped gummies and then I got some apple rings and they're both a different milligrams so a little background CBD is a compound that is found in marijuana however CBD does not get you high it's the THC that does get you stoned so these are CBD is meant for people who have pain physical pain anxiety depression certain things that they have and this is kind of a natural remedy for that because a lot of people don't want to take pain pills and as we know pills are a huge problem and it's an epidemic people are getting hooked on oxycontin oxycodone like all that [ __ ] like that's really bad it's really bad for you and unfortunately people get hooked so quickly so um they look like this they're probably let's see the size of a little bit larger than a quarter and so this is what it looks like it's just a gummy they taste pretty good and like I said there is no THC they're made in the USA this whole entire container is 500 milligrams and then I believe there is let's see it tells you how many how many milligrams are for each but honestly I didn't even look I just took one I also have trouble sometimes with insomnia so these are really great for this I've noticed that after I took these I was really sleepy and I just felt really relaxed but I kind of wanted to go to sleep so I recommend taking these at night if you are a person who kind of has trouble falling asleep these are really awesome for you if you have any eights and pains or back problems or anything like that these are helpful too if you have anxiety these kind of help you calm down and make you feel kind of more relaxed okay let's see so this one the Apple rings are 250 milligrams and there are 12 pieces so what 250 divided by 12 I can't do the math in my head but either way that's how many milligrams are for each ring let's see there like I said they're made in the USA which is nice I just got these on just CBD calm so they have a whole variety of different products you can choose from they have oils they have other kind of like food snacks they have like dried fruit and they have the gummies of course I just picked these because they kind of caught my eye so these two together worth $50 free shipping which is always kind of a nice little perk and like I said just to emphasize you do not get high when taking these it is a different sensation altogether if you are a stoner then you are already educated on this and you know that these are not for you don't get the hi they're just more for physical ailments also like I said mental ailments too if you have anxiety because it kind of really calms you down some people prefer the CBD oil but I think these are a bit more fun and I felt it right away I don't know maybe it was a placebo but when I took one of the gummy heart I felt like really sleepy right away um it wasn't I didn't feel hi obviously um but I just felt really sleepy really relaxed I basically just wanted to go to bed and so for me personally I'm not I would not take these during the daytime because obviously I have a bit busy schedule I work with kids I go to school blah blah blah I have two jobs so I can't be taking these in the daytime because then I will fall asleep on the job there was one time on a sidenote I was working this was a few years ago and I was working and I wasn't feeling good and I took a Tylenol which I'm not a huge I don't really take Tylenol or aspirin or advil much anymore just because I don't know I don't feel like it's good for your body but anyway so I took some Tylenol and come to find out it was Tylenol PM so I was like I was about to fall asleep I was in the break room with my head on the table and I was like oh my god what have I done um so anyway yeah so I recommend don't take these during the day like unless you have the day off and you're just like lounging around all day then like go for it you know do that um if I was then yeah I would do that too but just be careful they're not edibles so I just keep just want to keep emphasizing you don't get high you don't get so if you're gonna buy these me like yeah but again I'm gonna get stoned it's like no you're not at all so just keep that in mind if you do want to get edibles then make sure there's THC in them and then have a great time enjoy um but I just wanted to try these because they're becoming a little bit more mainstream you can like almost buy them anywhere I wanted to do some research online to find the most kind of credible product and something that has pretty good ingredients obviously because these are gummies so they can they can contain things that I might not want to ingest like you know fake sugars or whatever but every seems pretty straightforward let's see they have they use the sweet and sweetener from beets did you do they do have red or red died which I'm not a huge proponent of but yeah so anyway um and when you taste them you know they taste like I said they taste pretty good there is a little bit of an aftertaste of cannibal cannibal no no no no cannibal cannabis oil can it can a bit whale what but there's a little bit of like an earthy aftertaste if that makes any sense but do ya I do recommend these for those a friend of mine has some back pain and I think these would be helpful for him yeah and if you get period cramps these are helpful too or like whatever you know you had a bad breakup your you know your dog's being an [ __ ] like whatever try these you know so yeah it's called just CBD and I'm really hoping this does a thumbnail I probably won't but anyway um yeah I recommend these and you know I will put the link in the description block the the description box and then you guys can check it out I wish I was sponsored I'm not but that'd be cool so anyway alright have a great day guys and thanks for watching I'll see you next time bye", "Oq5TDIK-0iY": "this is so pleasant shut up - just

getting into some gummies from them as well I'm excited but for now that's all I have for you the links down below check them out they have many products and so far I likey and I know I'm out [Music]", "3QMf4ZOpJKU": "my name is Willie Christie I'm a wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "WonzWlgPwJA": "[Music] Nihao everybody thank you for tuning in to mis TV today be sure to hit like and subscribe it's today we're gonna cover a new slightly unorthodox but very popular aspect of vaping C B D what is CB d now CBD which is an abbreviation of canna video is a completely legal non psychoactive extract taken from the larger cannabis plant now unlike the illegal yet far more popular tetrahydrocannabinol or THC CBD has had all psychoactive compounds stripped away from it meaning it has all of the shall we say physical effects of the plant without any of the mental effects of traditional cannabis now people have been using cannabis and cannabis derived medicines for years to treat many different symptoms however many are a little bit nervous about engaging with the devil's lettuce due to elements such as it illegality the sometimes complicated nature of procuring it wherever you are obviously you should be doing that because it's illegal and also the slightly nerve inducing or paranoiac aspects of it that many people do suffer from when trying to use it as a medicine now traditional THC operates on the body's cb1 receptors many of which are located in the brain CBD is a little different CBD operates on the body's cb2 receptors which are located primarily in the body's inflammatory system meaning that the effects of the substance are entirely physical and whilst not straying into language that I cannot use all of its effects are going to be those which operate on your body's inflammatory system so if you find you are having issues that involve inflammation CBD can be a very powerful compound now as you're probably aware by this point you are watching this video after all CBD is growing in popularity at a rapid pace here in brighton and hove alone we already have CBD specialist or CBD products told from help senses CBD dispensaries even cafes and kitchens which specialize in CBD infused cannabis and other foods containing CBD but you're here because you're interested in vaping now what would be the benefits of vaping it there are some when vaping CBD it enters the bloodstream far quicker than when ingesting it orally or using it as a topical balm this immediate and strong onset of effect can provide a lot of its users with a greater sense of control over the symptoms that they are choosing to treat with it and generally speaking when people vape it they can be very confident in the fact that they have a very determined idea of exactly what their dosages and when and how they're going to apply it now if you've chosen to vape CBD there are a couple avenues you can take some of which are related to ease of use other ones about more precise dosage and control of dosage now the easiest thing that you can do would be to purchase something like one of these ten mil pre-mixed CBD infused e-liquid by us here at mist the e-liquid clocking in at a hundred milligrams which is a fairly reasonably strong dose one that you'll certainly get the chance to feel and a great way to experiment with the subject with the substance without having to worry about it being too strong too weak anything like that using something like this all you would need to do is purchase yourself a simple mouth to lung kit or some kind of POD system and then like usual just go about filling it the way that you normally would no complication to it and those strangeness and like usual just pop it in the side and fill up to about the top of your window I do specify the use of a mouth to lung machine like this because the majority of pre-mixed CBD II liquids are going to be very PG heavy they're rarely very thick however there are as an alternative we would recommend these these are what we refer to as CBD booster shots these are effectively CBD top-ups all you would need to be doing is getting an empty tank popping in something like two to four to six droplets of this substance in there and then just filling it the rest of the way with your favorite eliquid these booster shots generally are going to be a little bit pricier than the pre-mixed ones but this is because they are going to last you these are far stronger coming in 500 milligram and a thousand milligrams spectively you will need to be adding this by the droplet now don't worry about getting nervous about measurements here on our website just type in CBD calculator we have a very simple to use robust system that will take a few details from you like how much CBD do you have let's say 10 mils of it how strong is it let's say 500 milligrams grant how big is your tank probably a 2 mil tank if you bought it in the UK and then what's your preferred daily dosage and then you just type that in hit the button that will instantly tell you how many drops of CBD booster to add to your tank so as to infuse it and infuse your favorite a liquid with your daily dosage now there are a couple different varieties of CBD that are used in a liquid and the mist range uses a particular one known as full-spectrum CBD as opposed to the previous industry standard of CBD isolate CBD isolate is painstakingly extracted from the plant and it's an extremely pure process they just take the absolutely necessary CBD from the plan the CBD we use here at mist is referred to as full-spectrum CBD full-spectrum as a post isolate takes everything it legally can from the plant so as to give you the most possible good in your substance we hope we've given you some good explanation as to the ease of vaping CBD today if you would like

not satisfied", "1e6yqV8W73c": "hi fam how you guys doing so today I'm gonna be doing another a just CBD gummy review so the funny part is guys I did a video um maybe a couple years ago I'm not exactly sure when I posted it but it got like 11,000 views and I so appreciate you guys watching but also if you could hit subscribe and like that would just be amazing so today I'm gonna be doing the just CBD gummies I got a thousand milligrams of the Sharpe gummies and thus our hearts and these come around every February for Valentine's Day so it's kind of a fun little limited edition whatever so for those of you who are new to my channel welcome thank you guys for tuning in so in my other video I kind of I rewatched it and I felt like I wasn't as prepared as I could have been so CBD for those of you who don't know cannabidiol CBD is a naturally occurring compound found in the resin flower of cannabis a plant with a rich history as a medicine going back a thousands of years both CBD and THC have significant therapeutic attributes but unlike THC CBD does not make a person feel stoned or intoxicated so CBD is for anxiety cramps period cramps headaches sleep I take them to help me with my sleep because sometimes I have insomnia and its really effective for me some people asked in my previous video if these have melatonin in them they do not have melatonin so if you guys are wondering that that's one question that I can answer for you no melatonin however something that I had mentioned in my previous video I'm not too thrilled because some of them do have red dye number four so some of them have other things that aren't like for instance gummy sharks they have artificial flavors so I'm not a huge fan of that just because it's not good for you it's like whatever chemicals however if they're effective then I try to wave that off so these are made in the USA their THC free so if you guys are stoners these are not going to get you high okay these are not gonna get you high you're not going to be stoned and there everyone has a different reaction a lot of the people commented on my video that they do it for anxiety a lot of people also mention that they didn't feel anything and I guess just like weed which this is not everyone has a different reaction so maybe you need to take more but this is made with hemp obviously it's a plant and yeah they have to keep reading it breed or eating its THC free because then people are gonna be like oh oh my god I didn't get high screw you guys oh my god wow these gummy sharks are kind of demented looking hmmm alright so with these ones here I had a long day I just came back from San Francisco so I wanted to put this video up for you guys cuz I got an email saying it was delivered so for the thousand milligrams it says to take one two three gummies every six hours as needed so just because it's a thousand milligrams doesn't mean it's a higher content it just means each gummy divided that by a thousand and it looks like there's set it on here well now I ripped the packaging I think I think it said approximately 68 pieces no come anyway and these sour hearts I'm gonna try one of these two the gummy sharks tastes really good um like I said in my previous video there's a little bit of an aftertaste but it's nothing to you know get upset about should I do the white what the pink or the white and the ones I got before were not sour they were just regular so let's give it a go my boyfriend love disease she eats them as candy honey I still have sugar in them dairy free fat free gluten free msg free that's good so I really do like these two and um I'm happy with my purchase so I used a promo code I got 20% off um I don't really know how it popped up I essentially was on the website just CBD calm and then I clicked out and I was like a different browser and then it was like don't leave yeah and then here's a 20% off coupon code so um and it was like all these different numbers if it Oh actually I think it might have been just 20 don't tell anyone but maybe give that a try so they're not inexpensive but they do come from a marijuana plant and they extract the the CBD from there so these two together were 16 free shipping and that was after the 20% off so it was originally gonna be 75 it's not cheap but I like to invest in my mental health and it really helps me with sleep and anxiety so I recommend it and as usual I will leave the link below and I will also leave the link to my original video and I hope you guys like it and thank you so much for the support and the love

"CBD oil they benefits tips and safety concerns people have been smoking cannabis for longer than you can guess both recreationally and medicinally but maybe you don't want to smoke cannabis either because you don't like the high or you can't have THC in your system because of drug tests luckily for you CBD manufacturers have quickly taken the baking technology that has become popular for nicotine users and converted it to enable CBD usage in the next few minutes we'll cover the benefits of vaping CBD and tips for picking the right CBD liquid for you as well as major safety concerns that you should be aware there are four main reasons to vape CBD the first is fast absorption vaping is the single fastest rate of absorption for CBD when inhaled the CBD quickly enters the bloodstream through your lungs completely skipping the digestive tract this is great for those who suffer from anxiety or pain that comes and goes it's also inconspicuous unlike smoking nicotine or cannabis CBD oil has a very discreet odor that will not alert people around you to its use the vaporizer itself is small enough to fit in your pocket or purse and come in place enough that no one is likely to question what substance that you're using CBD oil is also very pure the best vaping liquids come with a maximum of four ingredients seaweedy often an isolate form and ingredient are - to bind and thin the oil to make it big full and sometimes a flavoring component no extra chemicals additives or harmful substances just pure CBD the fourth and last reason is flexible dosage anxiety and chronic pain sufferers know that these problems come and go and can often strike out of the blue with an oil or pill based delivery system you can't customize your dosing for these difficult times when vaping you can smoke during those bad times to get relief and not use the vape as much or even at all when you are feeling well next up is the topic of safety there is one question people always ask about vaping and that is is it safe especially for non-smokers the thought of vaping isn't always comfortable so there are two things that we want to mention the first is that the long-term effects of baking either CBD or nicotine are not yet known unlike cigarettes there are a lot of chemicals in the liquids that are used to vape unfortunately doctors still aren't sure if that makes them much healthier for you the next is propylene glycol which is used as a thinning compound in many CBD hemp oils to dilute the oil enough to allow it to be baked the FDA considers propylene glycol safe for ingestion as a food additive the problem is that the substance becomes toxic at high temperatures and could cause damage to respiratory organs therefore it's best to use vape products that don't contain the substance if you're interested in a vape product that we trust we'll leave a link in the description below we've also put together a free ebook for you to download called the complete guide to CBD if you have any questions about CBD its uses or how to take it you'll find the answers there just go to WWE and health comm slash book to download it if you have any questions

"the heist but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I will be back very very soon because I'm gonna be doing a live stream in the next 20 minutes so peace will learn seriously noise just ate some more meta balls and got stoned

So let's, Let's give it a try.\n- Let's try one. (soft music) It's a really good texture. It's a really good flavor. - Yummy. - (laughs) These are really good. - They really are. - Me personally, I prefer sour. - Yep. So, we have a whole line\nof gummies coming out. We have blue raspberry. We have a peach, a sour peach, and then we also have... jam berry. - Blue razz. Yep. Jam berry's the other one. So yeah, it's pretty, pretty exciting.

So I've had a couple customers come back and say at that strength, it's actually changed their life. - Yep. - They didn't even know\nwhat it felt like to live without pain, so... that's pretty exciting.\n- Yeah, it's really cool. - Yeah. - Well, awesome.

(suspenseful music)", "VrJKs8cDhto": "CVD effects CBD vape juice review what's up guys my name is Eden I'm the owner of well se comm and today I'm going to be reviewing the entire line of the CBD effects CBD vape juice now the CBD effects CBD vape juice is made with 99% pure CBD isolate meaning that it is 100% free of THC and that there is only CBD in there and the full line of the CBD effects CBD vape juice is available in 250 milligrams 500 milligrams and a thousand milligrams of CBD per 30 mil bottle now let's first walk through the entire line of the CBD effects CBD vape juice products Before we jump into today's review video so first up we are going to be reviewing the wild watermelon from CBD effects and I mean I'm excited because watermelon is honestly an incredible flavor when it comes to vape juice products and I mean watermelon is just an incredible fruit so definitely looking forward to that one next up on the list we have the strawberry milk you know for those of you that like the creaminess kind of sweet mixed with a fruit flavor so that is another one that I'm really looking forward to trying next up we have the strawberry Kiwi and I mean let's face it guys strawberry Kiwi is like one of the best flavor combinations ever and I mean those two fruits like even if you're not vaping if you're just eating strawberries and Kiwis together you're definitely having a good time you know I'm a huge fan of both those fruits so really looking forward to that one as well next up we have the blue raspberry and I mean let's face it guys blue raspberry is just a classic fruit flavor I'm kind of expecting um I don't know if it's gonna be a candy blue raspberry or if it's gonna be a full-out fruit blue raspberry flavor so eager to give that one a go next we have the rainbow candy and you know that rainbow candy just as the name implies it's definitely going to remind you of some of your favorite sort of rainbow candies that you've had you know think of skittles think of sprees and you know those two candies that wins me over right there because those are some of my favorite candies and then last but certainly not least and the one that I am most looking forward to trying because I am a serial vape juice lover is the fruity cereal and you know just as the name implies it's going to really have sort of some notes of milk or creaminess that are perfectly paired with a fruity sort of cereal think fruity pebbles Froot Loops so not gonna lie that's the one that I am most excited to try with you guys today so now let's jump right in I'm so the first one we're going to be doing is a the wild watermelon in the entire line that I'm going to be reviewing today they're all gonna be in 500 milligrams and what's great about vaping especially if you need some relief from CBD very very quickly like that vaping it vaping has a near immediate effect meaning once you start pulling on that within a few seconds the CBD really starts to be absorbed and start to take effect so today I'm gonna be using as with all the review videos I'm gonna be using an RDA and then but I did want to point out you know you can use the CB effects CBD vape juice in a sub ohm tank such as this or you can use it in a pod device such as the smock Nord which is one of my classic favorites or you know if you really want to stick on the CBD side of things um you can also use the CB FX CBD vape juice in the koi Zen CBD vape device which is of course available well se com alright so wild watermelon shake it up guys ooh it smell it reminds me of a watermelon candy very sweet very fruity mmm flavor smells amazing now let's give it a vape drop it on the RDA all right of course you know I just put on a brand new wick so gonna give it a couple seconds to kind of saturate the wick don't want to burn it or anything what a great flavor experience so all right and then when vaping guys um CBD I always recommend that you stick anywhere between 40 and you know even 80 Watts is pushing it I like to stick between 40 and 60 today I'm actually going to actually let me crank this up I'm going to be vaping on the good old classic 420 so let's give the wild watermelon watermelon to go ooh ooh very candy it candy watermelon is what it reminds me of ooh but it's very the the fruit flavor of watermelon is definitely there but I kind of get sort of like a like a watermelon candy kind of taste I mean mm-hmm that is really good like the second you aam take a draw and you inhale the vapor you are your taste buds are instantly filled with you know the taste of wild watermelon and see the it effects in a phenomenal job on this watermelon flavor and you know I've tried tons of watermelon flavors especially on the vape juice side of things but I do have to say this is very very good one of my more favorite watermelon flavors you know on the flavor scale out of one to ten I'm gonna have to give that a straight seven out of ten no doubt about it very very good give it one more baby damn that's so good and it's got some good vapor products you know the VG PG ratios and even balance of 50/50 but you know and I'm the effects of the CBD they're starting to kick in you know it's really what I feel first initially uh my focus and concentration I feel just laser focused right now so let's burn off the wild watermelon all right and then the next flip we're going to be doing wonderful strawberry milk just like the wild watermelon it's gonna be a 500 milligram and I'm a huge fan of these chubby gorilla kind of small bottles because they're really easy to you know put into your pocket the one thing the downside to them whereas like with our well sec but oil that you can vape they come in tinctures so it's easier to kind of measure out your dose and calculate your dose per serving that way with these since they got the needle nose tips it's a little more difficult for you to exactly know I mean of course you can judge it based off the size of your vape tank you know basically to calculate your serving per milliliter do the total amount of CBD in the bottle in this case to 500 milligrams divided by the size of the bottle 30 ml bottle so that would mean sixteen point six six milligrams of CBD per milliliter you know a lot of vape tanks are you know one and a half to three milliliters so then you just multiply that by however the however big your tank is that you're using so alright the strawberry milk let's give it a smell strawberry it smells just like strawberry milk you know just like if you were to pour yourself a nice tall glass of milk and then put like the Hershey's strawberry syrup in there it smells just like that mmm I'm very interested to try this because in the past you know I've been vaping I've aped like milk flavored stuff fruity cereals I I don't really if any time people try and make something else besides like cereal with milk it always tastes funny to me so but let's see how this strawberry milk taste from CBD effects alright I definitely initially you get that strawberry and then as the flavor matures and kind of lingers in your mouth and during the exhale that's when you start to at least I start to taste the creaminess of this strawberry so are the creaminess of the milk mixing with the strawberry flavor actually I was worried about you know having milk in there as I said it tastes funny sometimes for me and some juices but actually CBD effects really paired the strawberry milk I mean it's an ideal combo but it is difficult to do and CBD effects really did a phenomenal job blending the strawberry with the milk it's not overpowering or anything I mean for me I'm a huge strawberry guy I would have liked a little bit more strawberry flavor but that's not to say I don't taste it at all like once during that exhale I get a full strawberry milk flavor in my mouth in it I love that so [Applause] on the flavor scale on one between 1 and 10 I'm gonna have to put that one at a 7 out of 10 as well I like it um you know it's I would vape that absolutely they turned me into kind of a strawberry milk of a juice lover now so nicely done CBD effects so I gave the the wild watermelon a 7 out of 10 I gave the strawberry milk a 7 out of 10 so so far we're off to a really really solid start oh one other thing I wanted to point out about the CBD effects bottles I am it's so important to always look for third-party test results from buying CBD products if you don't find them for a company you don't buy it but what's really awesome about these CBD effects bottles is right here there is a QR code that you can just pull at your camera and take a picture of it and scan it and then it'll take you right to the lab results you know it's very very important you know you can't always take what a company says by their word you know you need a unbiased third party that is also verifying what they're telling so alright let's move on to the next flavor which is going to be these strawberry Kiwi and let's be honest guys strawberry Kiwi is a very very very popular vape juice combination it's a very popular drink combination smoothie combination you know there's countless strawberry Kiwi drinks out there strawberry Kiwi smoothies out there so I am super stoked to be trying the strawberry Kiwi from CBD effects and you know I really love CV effects the packaging I always got to point that out when I love a company's packaging I'm definitely gonna point that out so I applaud you guys on the branding CBD effects let's burn off the strawberry milk all right and as I said guys you can use it in a RDA such as this sub ohm tank or a pod device such as the smock Nord alright so I think that strawberry milk is all burned off now all right now let's drop it on to the RDA a little strawberry Kiwi action going on let's see what CBD effects has in store for us for the strawberry Kiwi because I got some high hopes for you guys so hopefully I'm not disappointed alright put the cap on please do not vape on an RDA without putting on the cap it won't be a pleasant experience so here we go oh that is an ideal combination of strawberry cream initially I get the strawberry and then the Kiwi comes in but really like I really taste that Kiwi the Kiwi is definitely in there I mean the strawberry for sure but for me I experienced more of the Kiwi flavor out of the strawberry Kiwi vape juice so I'm given another go ooh that's a very kind of it's not overly sweet you know it's a sweet subtle fruity blend of strawberries and Kiwis I actually out of the none of the three flavors we've reviewed today I definitely like that strawberry Kiwi slightly more than the wild watermelon and then the strawberry milk you know I'm actually gonna have to give myself got to put a little bit more on my wick because I actually want to a vape on this a little bit more give it another flavor test but you know I gave the wild watermelon and the strawberry milk a 7 out of 10 both of them for the strawberry Kiwi I'm gonna have to give that a 7 point 5 out of 10 i actually I really really like that I mean I honestly wouldn't be against combining the strawberry Kiwi with that wild watermelon flavor from CBD effects I think that would be a perfect trio of some tasty fruits if you ask me all right so I mean I'm definitely gonna have to give it another baby cuz I do really really like that that strawberry Kiwi is absolutely wonderful CBD effects I would vape that all day no problem so you know so far the strawberry Kiwi is my favorite I'm givin that a 7 point 5 out of 10 very solid score so now let's move on to the fourth flavor from CBD effects CBD vape juice line we'll be reviewing which is going to be the classic flavor of tasty blue raspberry and let's be honest guys who doesn't love some good old-fashioned blue raspberry flavors you know I mean I grew up eating blue raspberry otter pops you know suckers it's blue raspberry just a classic flavor so I'm stoked that CBD effects decided hey let's make a blue raspberry CBD vape juice so of course burn it off all right yeah I just want to make sure guys that I'm not you know messing with any of the flavor profiles let's smell this hmm blue raspberry all the way that's all I get hmm oh all right sometimes guys even if you want to try something like this CVD vape juice um see the effects you can put it on your finger and do it I call it a fear testimony oh my god it's a blue raspberry all the way no doubt about it ooh all right let's give it a fake let's see all right put it on there put the RDA cap back on ooh my entire mouth is second I started pulling on it even when I was raising the vape device up towards my mouth my eye instantly smelled the blue raspberry so once I started pulling on that and the vapor started being produced it was all blue raspberry is a very very very strong you know it's not overpowering though it's like it's a blueberry it's a blue raspberry flavor to the face it is phenomenal mmm mmm it honestly mmm it reminds me of I believe they have I believe they're called rat Razzles um they have blue raspberry Razzles those little hard candies that you chew and then they turn into chewing gum this tastes just like that that blue raspberry flavor no doubt about it tastes like just a candy blue raspberry flavor that the blue raspberry is I like that better than even the strawberry Kiwi not by much though because on the flavor scale I'd give it a seven point eight out of ten I gave the strawberry Kiwi a seven point five the wild watermelon and the strawberry milk a seven out of ten so so far I have not disliked any of the CBD effects CBD vape juices and Wow that blue-raspberry incredible my mouth I still taste the blue raspberry as I'm talking to you right now it's just it's lingering around in my mouth and all right next up we have the rainbow candy CBD vape juice from CBD effects and you know this one is right off the bat I'm initially thinking you know sprees or skittles on candy flavors fruit flavors all in one you know so if you're a candy lover even if you love sprees or skittles um I would definitely consider this rainbow candy from CBD effects a truck it go and let's see how let's actually see how it holds up because I have some very high expectations for this rainbow candy from CBD effects so alright let's go ahead and drop it on the the wick alright make sure it's nice and saturated boom just like on all the other ones guys I'm going to be using an RDA for this one but as I said earlier you can use a sub ohm tank such as this you can use a pod device such as this so you know the list goes on and on it's very compatible with pretty much any vape device that you may have alright let's give the rainbow candy from CBD effects a try alright oh yeah candy all the way the second you start inhaling it's it's a fruity candy flavor you know it's kind of a mix of fruits but like it definitely tastes like candy mmm ooh and I actually see the effects you did a really good job on you know maintaining that candy profile but also while delivering a sort of fruity flavor that goes with that candy flavor so I think it's an ideal flavor combination so if you love candy vape juices um this rainbow candy from CBD effects should be at the very top of your list so one more vape before I give it the flavor rating mmm all right I'm actually going to it put a little bit more liquid on there all right I want to make sure I give it a true and honest you know flavor review and you know selfish motives I do actually really enjoy this flavor ooh it's like a tropical rainbow candy sort of a flavor profile you know on the flavor scale no doubt about it I'm gonna have to give it an 8 out of 10 that's a very solid score in my opinion and I would vape that all day no doubt about it and that's very very tasty all right guys um so the very last flavor from the CBD effects CBD vape juice line that I'm going to be reviewing today is the one that I am most excited to be reviewing because if you've been watching wellness wednesdays our weekly livestream that we have on Facebook or you've been following this for any time you will know that anytime somebody asked me what my favorite profile to vape is without a doubt I always answer fruity cereal Froot Loops you know serial based flavors I go absolutely crazy for them so when CBD effects notified me that they were releasing a fruity cereal CBD vape juice just imagine how excited I was and just imagine and actually you'll see just how excited I am today to be reviewing it with you because I have some very high hopes for this flavor profile because I've tried many non CBD fruity cereal or cereal based vape juices and even some other fruity cereal CBD vape juices and so they got a lot to live up to so let's see what CBD effects uh how they did with this a formulation so ooh creamy milk with fruity pebbles or Froot Loops that you get that fruity smell in there ooh okay so far off to an amazing start because this smells very similar to some of my favorite cereal vape juices out there so nicely done CVD effects let's go hopefully you guys don't disappoint once I go to vape it alright let's see saturate your coil guides make sure you don't want to burn your coil or your wick all right let's give the fruity cereal a try oh my god phenomenal nicely done CBD effects and I love you forever and always for making this flavor not going to lie I use the CBD effects fruity cereal so so much I've had to get a lot of bottles from them or even just you know pull from our inventory for my personal use because guys like I vape through this bottle you know I could go through it in a couple of days no doubt about it it's incredible guys the fruity cereal it's it's creamy milk and then just a blast of you know a fruity flavors like you'd experience in fruit loops or fruity pebbles it makes me feel as if I'm sitting there as a kid watching those Saturday morning cartoons enjoying my favorite bowl of fruit loops or fruity pebbles so not going to lie guys I mean if you love cereal flavors this fruity cereal CBD vape juice from CBD effects should be a no-brainer and you should absolutely pick it up right now at wwlp.com if in regards actually let me give it one more poll ooh alright no doubt about it I got to give that an 8.5 out of 10 for the flavor scale and that is the highest ranked flavor from the CBD effects CBD vape juice line alright guys so ranking the the CBD effects CBD vape juice flavors from favorite to least favorite you know but you know I want to preface this um I gave the CVD effect CBD vape juice flavors a very solid score all around there wasn't really one that um I strongly disliked to be honest I would vape every single one of them daily no doubt but you know so from my most favorite of course is going to have to be the fruity cereal which I put that in at an 8.5 second place is going to be the rainbow candy which I put at an 8 out of 10 solid score then next up we have the blue raspberry I was a huge fan of that I gave that a seven point eight out of ten then next we got this strawberry Kiwi some of my favorite fruit pears I gave that one a a seven point five out of ten and then tied for last place was the strawberry milk and then the wild watermelon which I gave is seven out of ten so like I said guys those are some solid scores all around so whether you're looking for I'm kind of a sweet sort of creamy cereal flavor you're looking for a candy flavor or just an all-out fruit flavor explosion the CBD effects CBD vape juice line has an option for you I want to touch on the effects you know vaping has a quick is still onset of delivery of effects from CBD so you know after my initial vape of the very first babe to some CBD effects the wild watermelon I did start to feel the CBD start to go into effect for me but now after vaping all five of those flavors a few times and getting a healthy amount of CBD into my system and when I say healthy I mean like it's good for my system it's a good dosage for my system I feel incredible I don't know if you guys have noticed but I feel like Mike sort of my verbal fluency has really increased kind of the words are really just flowing out of my mouth my sentence structure is just spot-on you know the words are just flowing out of my mouth and I do feel like as the video went on I my enthusiasm in just my energy levels and just my happiness just really increase and I feel incredible and when it cut at the end of the day if I had to rate these on effects it's 10 out of 10 its quality third party lab tested CBD that source from right here in the United States so in my opinion that you cannot go wrong by purchasing the CBD

returning subscriber welcome back um before we get into this video I want to you guys to subscribe like comment and share this video um this video is going to be a video that um kind of gives you guys how about like an idea of what I use to help me deal with my anxiety back in January I suffered my very first like severe anxiety attack which also led to a panic at hot um which I had to be rushed to the hospital I couldn't breathe I really didn't know what was happening in like guys I was talking to the nurses and you know everybody they kind of you know knew the symptoms and you it was so they didn't want to medicate me but to you know speak to a group in one so before that happened I was taking a product called just CBD they were gummies they were featuring gummies I think there were about like 250 milligrams for CVD I believe I don't have the continuous with a lot of them um so I was using those those helped me a lot with like sleeping just getting through the day I'm I normally take one in the morning and then take one at night from what I was going to bed um and then I switched over to the vape CBD I know in some areas um vaping is banned I'm in my state it's the e-cigarettes um when choosing you brand for vaping and I know like I said everyone's gonna be like oh baby it's dangerous I think this um being able to find a brain that you trust um with their products and you know what's in it they're transparent about it with something big going into it um I have a smoke shop in my area in downtown Boston in the cold smoke city shop I will link them down below they also sell just CBD products they sell the gummies but they don't so be the they being or the cartridges um so I wanted to show you guys a little haul of items that I got now do you also want to clarify in this video this is not a sponsored video by just CBD these are thought of my own products just brought my own money and so nothing you know was sent there's no sponsorship in the city I'm not being paid for this this is my own opinion my own thoughts on the brands as a whole so without further ado we're gonna jump right into it and we're gonna open these little bad boys I did split it to make sure everything was any in make sure I had everything that I got in it so we're just gonna jump right into it so the first item we are going to pull out is a date juice I got this in the flavor mango mango ice is the flavor and it's a hundred and it's a hundred milligrams and we're gonna open it and see what it looks like on the inside so this is the big bottle that it comes with and this is like set for a pretty good decent price for it I believe it wasn't check step inside so these were $15.99 each so I have this flavor like I said it's the mango mango ice in that flavor and I spend on the side of the box um it does give you the where it's talks about it being um tobacco free conveniently need for your e cigarette vaping devices for intense sources and like I said CBD does not replace going to your doctor if you do take medication continue to consult your doctors on that me I just don't want to be medicated so like I said I do the gummies and now I'm like I said I'm switching over to the the oils I can so take it with me so I'm not carrying on this big bike like jock of gummy so it's kind of like another convenient for me I'm gonna see what other goodies I'm having here we also have the pineapple Express and this one comes based off of the Navy find out for sports if you have not seen it so it comes like this as well the same jar just different flavor you see it looks like a fair way to open it there we go you can smell it too so that that was also $15.99 I got three different flavors on this one is watermelon og time I want to get like flavors um if you do follow me on instagram you would have saw that I posted in a story I'm all plus the story in this video somewhere on the screen um I've gotten a pen from Busey so I have an Uzi pen the cartridge on top comes from panda sticks I believe that's how you pronounce it I will also link that pen in the cartridge down below if you want to go purchase those too I got that ez pen in that cartridge first because I knew this was coming and with everything going on I did not know if I was going to receive anything I'm via the mail but everything was still running normal and I got it within a good decent time frame so this is what the I said watermelon og looks like in this big bottle and I love the fact that the bottles are big like these are very big bottles for the price that I got them before like I've seen like I said in the smoke shop I go to they have like bottles smaller than this for the same price so I love the fact that these are big bottles they'll last me a while and I'm glad I got the three different flavors that they did I love the that I have so I'm really glad I got those and then I have a disposable cartridge it's like this is the watermelon so the Sigma C of OG 1 for it so this one is a disposable one this one is 200 milligrams for these cartridge let me open it so it looks like and then from boozy I did I do have an order coming from them my main include them in this video but it's this is more of a just EEE video because this is the main products that I'm going to be using like I'm not gonna go back to the Panda stick cartridge Luzi I'll keep the pen just cuz I have so I'll have the pen so I had two different pens so I also gun pen from just CBD but I'm just sticking to just CBD I'm not switching I'm not doing anything like I said I enjoyed the brain as a whole their response to customer service is really good like things like it's not like you're not waiting a whole entire day to hear back from somebody if you have an issue on a product I mean you can get a response right away so this is the and I may switch over to this one today this is what the pen looks like if I can get ever get it out hopefully by the end of this video I can get it out for you guys and show you guys what it looks like and put it on the pen so we're gonna sit this off to the side real quick so what they're also like I said I did order a battery so this is what the battery looks like um theirs is a 5-10 VV twist battery um the Uzi stick I have is also a 5-10 battery so I can also use the cartridges from just see beating on that pen in the future but like I said I did order 3 of the cartridges from Louise because I did order an Uzi pen so like I have three pens now so I have the first uz one be just CBD one I just showed you and then there's another one coming from Uzi so they each have their own cartridge and I can grab the Izzi pen and she goes it looks like I want to get this pout oh yeah my Lu Zhi ping it's like a little metallic like rainbow fish color the other one is a Rastafari so it has a Jamaican colors and this is the cartridge up top so the cartridge up top is from panda stick and like I said I will link it below and the stick is from and the battery is so easy so that is that one so I'm ordering so I ordered another battery in three of the cartridges to be able to fill because the only thing with just CBD I did not see and even I missed it but it's okay that they don't have like the cartridges sold on their own like he does like it was he has the ones which we can be filled with liquid so just CBD didn't have those and less like I said I missed it and I didn't see it hopefully in the future they do release some like that so we're like individually in the art empties like this one is if I don't think I can get the cap off for this one I can try but I so this is what this one looks like is the like I said the watermelon flavor we're gonna do a test to see how it tastes and like I said as I know people's concerns are she like be safe and I am like I said I'm not walking around like every hour gaping I'm I normally do it in the more like in the morning when I wake up I do about two to pups that's it um and then that night same thing two puffs that's it so I'm not like so because the guy was like oh this cartridge should last you you know only a couple of days like this has lasted me like almost a week and I guess I can show you what it looks like when everything goes down but has lasted me I pretty decent amount of time because I'm not pulling on it and I keep it my pen stays on 3.3 v so it does not leave that area so it does not leave you can see it on the bottom it does not leave that smart so like it's on the lowest of the low so I'm not puffing so much so this is what the pen looks like and I love that piece and these have a lower voltage so these this one starts at two point two point zero B this one starts at three point three in the highs that it goes to is four point zero which I love so I can definitely put that on a smaller voltage I'm sold it like I said so and then this is my charging port that will go into it like I said I also have another the same thing came with this one that was e1 mix and I love effect you just twist and it comes on so these are the two that I have like I said this one is just CBD which is labeled is label sorry about that my camera dies I'm gonna make this really quick so these are the two that I have and then the last item I don't know like there was a certain thing going on but they sent me a free a free item I don't know if I mean it's like I never tried this so this is there just and it's a body soap I'm so I'm down there to really try this in the flavour of cherry pie and it smells really good I open the box I like what I'd like smells really good I didn't know this was even in there so I'm kind of a little free treat to try it so you guys so I'm definitely I'm going to try this come to night and see how I like it and see how it worked like fields and they said it's created for all faces and all skin types to enjoy to him him Ronnie so so it's handcrafted body so label and sing it with it I'm not the lighting looks different in the camera looks flipped in a different way please excuse me I kind of switch over to my phone to film the remainder of it so yeah so this is the soap duck I said that came with it um this one I did not purchase on my own um this one was sent in the box I don't know if it was like a free gift and he spent so much I said I opened it it was in there so thank you just see beauty for this one um but like I said I'm so proud of everything that I had like I said the stick the bat the flavors and I definitely would have you guys posted on how you know I'm doing with them and like I said I love them all to death like the company in itself is all is a good brand um I hope they do come out with more flavours um I hope that they do come out with just the cartridges on their own I'm not pre filled with anything so you

vitamin E in their CBD oils I'm CBD everyone's like Oh CBD you should high it sweet no CBD does not get you high CBD is part of my marijuana plant but it's not the part that gets you high so you're

you cop any products that I have and thank you for watching hope see you guys in my next one you", "nGVy0fcY548": "thanks for stopping by and showing interest in this product keep watching this video to see our full and honest review guys I'm damn Hoff operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available on the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies one of the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD D is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure CBD and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is point three percent for hemp according to the US farm bill now that point three percent is even below one percent so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plant so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like cbn CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBD so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs where CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the eye slits because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting then you are still getting the good effects the Supplemental effects of we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD might have came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one or two more of the coated gummies whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavor gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think of sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once a while it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller sorbents generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just to sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're ready to go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about 120 gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's get a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and all the donors so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummies so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poorer flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high quality of Airy high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is ZERO THC in there

subscribe if you'd like in today's video I'm gonna be sharing with you about the Charlotte's Web CBD gummies I bought these a week and a half ago at Bailey's gym I seen that they sell these I thought cool I've been wanting to try to show this web for a while I've never gotten the courage to actually purchase it because they're a little bit pricey but this is a lemon-lime flavor it is 10 milligrams per gummy so the serving size recommends too so that's 20 milligrams it's hemp extract infused gummies it has 25 calories 6 grams of carbs total sugar 3 grams sodium 10 milligrams it has lemon balm L thenen and the hemp extracts these come in a variation this is calm I use these for anxiety they also have post gym recovery and for sleep so I have tried these and I'm gonna share with you what I like about on what I don't really like about them and if I'm gonna continue using these and if they help me what I like about these is they actually taste like candy which is kind of well it's kind of scary but it's pretty cool they taste like sweet tarts if you ever have sweet tarts are very bitter and sour they look like these yes it's like little candies it's cut they're cute squishy they're like gummy bears what I also like is there portioned really well so you're not gonna go over or under if you're doing those drops those drops like you can easily take a little bit more take a bit less and say well I don't feel good today you might have not taken enough or so have you so these are portioned really well you could tell if they're working for you based on the recommended serving size because you know you're getting the exact amount I also like how it gives a very leveled calm it's very leveled you don't feel really hard and you don't feel really anxious you're just kinda in the middle I use these and I go to the gym I go out and about it makes me kind of want to like go do something and I'm a little more chatty on them I'll talk more I like that about them what I don't like about these well for one I don't like their price this is $54 I got these for much cheaper because they were on sale but you know this is why I didn't buy them from the get-go online because of their price so honestly I think they should be cheaper that's just me another thing is they don't they don't help on a bed and anxiety day when I'm really anxious they don't do much I don't know if it's just because I'm not taking enough milligrams maybe I need to take more but personally I wanted to go based on the serving size that they recommended and even stuff I don't see a very big change I would say but that's just me I mean everybody is different who knows you know it might work for one person but for me it's kind of just a little boost a little boost it's not enough for me to be like wow these gummies are perfect for me they're not they are not unfortunately they're great like if I'm having a pretty good day and not really anxious I just want to get out and need a little pick-me-up or something just want to feel calm just relax nothing's really bothering me this helps relax you a little bit but for me these are not strong enough and I just don't want to run through these because they're not cheap so why would I want to take more than what would last me maybe a month so it's definitely hard because CVV is not cheap it is pretty pricey and there's so many CBD companies to choose from I just want to give you my honest take on how I feel about these so that you don't go out and get it for the sole purpose of severe anxiety and stuff like that because for me on my bad anxiety days these do not cut it on a good day these are great because I still have energy I want to talk I want to like get up and get out but are these my favorite no they are not my favorite but to each their own please subscribe and like my videos thank you for watching today in the future I will be posting more CBD videos I've been trying a bunch out lately so stay tuned but till next time bye guys", "xb0Abd51IEo": "hey what's up it's dustin and in this video i'm going to be doing a review on wild cbd gummies so i just wanted to show you uh the packaging um and it comes in a box and i've got this from a local dispensary here in oregon this product is created in oregon and they say that they use cbd concentrate derived from hemp that's made in the united states of america so that's cool they don't tell me exactly where the hemp comes from but they're an organ-based business and there's a lot of hemp in oregon so i'm guessing hopefully their cbd concentrate comes from oregon because that's uh the best place in the world to grow him anyway so here's their bottle and i'll just tell you right now i got the huckleberry flavor and it is uh 25 milligrams of cbd per gummy and i'll show you what the gummy looks like it's just a little rectangle here it's very sweet and to be honest it's extremely tasty i love the huckleberry flavor they also come in raspberry and there's a couple other flavors and this brand wild cbd they do gummies and they do sparkling water so it's interesting because they're in a space in the cbd world that isn't quite as common i mean gummies are very common um but they don't do the normal things like cbd tinctures or topicals or that kind of thing they they strictly are gummies and sparkling water so i really to be honest i really like the brand i looked up the coa of this product here and in addition to 25 milligrams of cbd per gummy and i believe that's the same serving size in their sparkling water as well 25 milligrams i looked and it is a full spectrum product full spectrum meaning it has a little bit of cbc in it and a little bit of cbn i didn't see any cbg and they call it a thc free product but it comes i don't think it's made with isolate i think it's actually made from a distillate of some sort an oil of some sort of concentrate of some sort so they have been able to remove the thc from that and uh they're left with with cbd gummy so anyway um a lot of different ingredients i'm not going to go into all of them it's a sweet product there's sugar obviously in it but anyway if you're interested in something other than maybe a tincture or some other oral means of getting your cbd and you like the idea of gummies this makes it really easy for you this bottle right here comes with 20 gummies and it costs 34.99 i believe 35 for the 20 gummies so you're looking at about i don't know what is that nearly a dollar fifty per gummy so a dollar fifty per 25 milligrams of cbd so i don't think it's a horrible price uh if that's the way that you want to get your cbd obviously there's there's some cheaper ways of going about it but um they say on the bottle it takes 90 minutes to activate so if you're eating it and digesting it it's going into your stomach and through your system it actually does take a little bit more time for cbd to absorb into your system whereas with the tincture if it goes if it absorbs um using using the oil into your system it can activate a little bit faster so anyway all that to say wildcbd.com if you want to give them if you want to check them out i really recommend them i think it's a great product they're giving you the cbd they're really upfront transparent about their coas they're an organ-based business so i really like that and it's a it's a tasty product it's a good way to get your cbd well thanks for watching the video if you want to buy any of our cbd products you can go to greenmethodfarms.com and be sure to use the promo code

"xSftr8wdzZY": "[Music] sup guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another CBD video but this time it's a different CBD company that worked with before floor CBD this one's going to be wild CBD with a Y but before we start all this let's go so with CBD it's a non-psychoactive cannabinoid so we're gonna we're gonna smoke some wax you know I'm saying it's you know so we're gonna smoke some wax to start the day I just woke up as you can tell from my funky ass hair we'll be doing this I'm not gonna be showing you this wax not that much left but it's tizzy wax that you can see it already but yeah we're gonna take a quick hit of this and we're gonna start this video on this CBD stuff I've actually had for like a month now I just been meaning to uh I've been mean to do it you know I'm saying so shoot boys [Music] do you know it [Music] all right so let's get started on this CD do you need to pick up some today so you're probably gonna see a pickup video somewhere along the line to maybe take a hit that's funny farms - I mean there's barely any left over see one here high wild CBD and for those of you who've seen this brand before they actually do have a line of CBD and THC products they were able to send me the CBD parts because CBD is legal you can freely send it to anyone in the United States it is a fully legal cannabinoid you know so there's no THC up in this all the facts are ready on here I already showed you that let's just open the box so right off the bat when you open it you get like this sense of like a sense that it's like a very neat little medicine type feel you know that feels like like a premium product just being in this case right here this was pretty cool school their supplement facts all that good stuff so there's only I think there's only ten in here ten gummies all that stuff so it's 25 milligrams each which is pretty pretty much a lie I say so that's why there's only ten of them just open this up and see what all the fuss is about I guess be in the lookout for another CBD product when you review for them it is sparkling water if you guys are interested in that I'm not the biggest fan of sparkling water but I know there's a lot of people that are you know so that video might be for you you know it's another way taking in CBD without you know if you don't really want to smoke hemp or or dab CBD isolate or whatever or dentures or something you know there's multiple ways that theater takes you soon [Music] punch it so right off the bat I would have thought these were gonna be gummy bears actually a fat piece boys so we're just gonna try one just because it's 25 milligrams you should always just eat one and wait obviously CBDs not ads that's crazy has THC you know if anything you'd probably just feel it only a little bit but you'll fill it here oh but right off the bat the taste phenomenal the aftertaste I do not feel any or I do not taste any like bitterness like I've done with I don't taste oh wait not there it is so the bitterness toward the end is minimal compared to the other brands that I've actually tried the gummy itself is very tender it's like and reminded me of like the fruit roll-up but like punched up into a square and more more tender you know not as chewy you don't have the to as much and it just easily you're just easily able to just bite through it this is what I reminded me of and it's not bad it's a 250 milligrams CBD total and there's 10 pieces so like I said it's going to be about 25 milligrams each so definitely you just watch what you're taking and just honestly not that bad you know I can only imagine what the THC ones will taste like - I'm not sure they're gonna be packaged the same way like this I'm really diggin packaging I really am it's very very nice I use a QR code here too and like I said this is their CBD lines so if you guys are interested you could actually buy it on their website the THC ones you're gonna have to go to the stores but see me Dean I'm saying and I know not a lot of people are probably in the CBD which is fine because you know it's not for everyone you know there are a lot of benefits when it comes to CBD and if you guys are looking to try something that's marijuana but not get like the psychoactive effects or like have it in your system let's just say you never get a drug test you know then uh try is to try some CBD you know just let me know how it feels I feel I feel like it just gives me a clearer mind and just it's like clearing out the fog in your brain for a little bit you know I'm saying it's like just things seem much more content I don't know how to explain it but that's how I feel other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the CBD video I don't do too much CBD videos but when companies send me stuff and if I like the product you know I'll do a video on it so other than that peace out guys [Music] [Music]", "c9shFJ3vSEA": "if you guys have watched my channel I've reviewed the e-liquid hemp bombs e-liquid here I've had the simple syrup this is their you know for making soda or whatever and I also reviewed their CBD oil but I think it's time to review something else let's review the CBD gummies from hemp bombs so as you can see the gummies look just like regular gummies they're about the same size and this particular bottle has 15 gummies in there 225 milligrams per bottle so that means each gummy has 15 milligrams of CBD oil and does see here they also have passiflora and scuttle area which I believe are supplements or natural you know plants to help you sleep as well so these things will really make me sleep let's try out the orange one here mmm alright tastes like a normal gummy it's just a little bit more kind of bitter flavor mmm so what these gummies you want to chewed up really really well and you want to wait for about 40 minutes to about an hour then you'll start to maybe feel a little bit extra relaxed mMmmm kind of leaning towards thinking he might actually be dead I guess I never saw him a lot so it's hard for me to tell the difference these are especially great for those who struggle with sleeping this is a great natural way to sleep you could take this problem with melatonin too and I just find this a great way this is this could help with anxiety or I don't know I think these are better than the oil for sleeps because of the passiflora and the CBD they have some sort of synergetic effect so yeah let's see let's see what it's like in 45 minutes it is so tempting not to take a nap right now oh I feel really relaxed I don't feel groggy the passiflora I think really is what makes me feel nice and relaxed so yeah I don't want to go to bed right now I could if I wanted to the last time I took one of these that I slept for like 11 hours so that'd be great for you if you need that I would also say this is great for ADHD I personally used to struggle with that a lot this doesn't help me focus better it just helps me with my hyperactivity it kind of just it kind of feels like I had a big meal and I feel relaxed let's go to the pool and if you guys have any questions let me know in the comments below there's also the link if you want to buy the gummies and I think that is it it works [Music] how's it going guys if you guys watch my chimp if you guys watch if you guys watch my channel [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "F8SKCbqRKyg": "five reasons to try CBD gummies many people have a soft spot in their hearts for dummies after all how many of us have taken by the men's in gummy form at some point or simply grabbed a bag to snack on but what does this have to do with CBD well in the last five to ten years the health benefits of taking CBD oil medicinally for a wide number of ailments has grown exponentially with that growth manufacturers and sellers of the product have quickly found numerous ways to take the substance including oils vaping topically and yes in gummy form if you've already decided that you want to try CBD oil for the health benefits it's likely that your next question is why would I take gummies instead of the other forms of CBD in the next few minutes we'll cover the reasons you may or may not prefer gummies to the other forms of CBD oil let's start with the fact that it's easy to take of all the forms of CBD gummies are for most people the easiest to take many people who have tried the oil form of CBD struggle putting it under their tongue or with the taste of it pills can also be a struggle if you don't like taking them or have issues swallowing gummies are formulated to have a fruit taste which is light and satisfying and most importantly is easy to consume gummies also have long lasting effects both vaping and the oil forms of CBD get into your bloodstream very quickly both of these methods bypass the digestive system and can be great options if you need instant relief from pain or anxiety the relief is generally short-lived however as the effects of vapor normally wear off in under an hour while oils last for a few hours with gummies you can normally get six to eight hours of relief thanks to the slower absorption and release that takes place in your digestive system dosing is also very easy with Gummy's ever tried to figure out exactly where they product it isn't easy and what exactly is a dropper full of CBD oil on the other hand gummies are easy need 10 milligrams of CBD and each gummy is 20 milligrams cut it in half and you are good to go they're also very discreet unfortunately there's still a social stigma in some circles surrounding anything that is related to cannabis if you are part of one of these circles even CBD use could be frowned upon in these situations something as ordinary as eating a quote/unquote gummy bear will be questioned and will still provide the benefits that you're looking for and finally there's no smoking involved one of the most common complaints we hear from people not wanting to try cannabis based products is that they don't want to harm their lungs well problem solved you can find CBD gummies both with and without th e to give you the benefits you want without ever having to smoke cannabis now we realized that we didn't cover many of the health benefits of CBD or recommend any CBD gummy brands in this video but we do have a free ebook covering both topics that you can download by going to plant driven health calm slash book if you have any questions regarding CBD gummies please leave them in the comments below and we'll reply and before you go we'd appreciate it that if you liked the video you leave us a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel for more CBD related content in the future", "gy47dkoOlU0": "hi I'm Shireen the founder of my pain centre your number one research or tried and trusted CBD products all the products we sell I use my parents use and my friends use we don't sell any product that we haven't tried or that we use in our daily lives so visit us at my pain center calm hey one of the questions we've been getting a lot lately which makes sense due to cove in nineteen is i'm new to CBD where do i start and that is a great question there's so many products right now out with CBD in it it isn't hard to know like what is the best place to start do you start with gummies do you start with an oil do you start with tea do you start with honey do you like there's just there's so many things there's coffee there's bath bombs there's lotions there's shampoos there's soaps i'm gonna give it to you real easy if you are new to CBD and you just want to try to see if it helps you whether you're struggling with sleep anxiety stress or pain I will recommend gummy bears start with the gummy bears or any sort of edible so chocolate almonds peppermints but make sure that the product actually has CBD in it meaning if it is being sold on amazon.com technically they're not allowed to sell products with CBD in it so just be careful where you're purchasing your CBD from now if you are having pain I'm just gonna caveat this from the gummy bears if you are having some sort of pain in your body that's like localized so you're just hurting like right here in the back of your neck or on your hand like just right here this is hurting I would suggest a cream you don't really need a CBD gummy unless for some reason that pain is keeping you up at night then you can also in conjunction use the CBD gummy now you're probably thinking okay well on my paints intercom there's like ten different types of gummies where do I start so all the gummies are pretty similar we just offer different taste profiles to fit our customers need so we have a five milligram gummy a 10 milligram gummy 20 and then 25 the most popular place to start is a 10 milligram gummy now here's the thing with CBD there is no set dosage that I can tell you is what you need everybody is so different it all depends on your weight your body genetics what you just ate what you're using it for how out-of-sync your body is so for example our bodies are like cars and we have to tune them and if you haven't tuned your body in a while you may need a little bit more CBD in the beginning to tune your car but it really doesn't matter about you and your you could have a partner and one of your partners could take a 10 milligram gummy and feel the same effects that you would need to take a 20 milligram gummy for it just varies like that so I'll give an example like I'll take a 10 milligram gummy during the day like if I'm about to like step into a really intense meeting or I have to get on the highway right I mean right now it's not as bad getting on the highway but I'm in Florida and we have a highway called I 4 and it's just a hot mess and so if I'm getting on i-4 I'll take a 10 milligram gummy I have a customer that's 280 pounds and if he takes a 10 milligram gummy he falls asleep he gets drowsy and that is a side effect of gummy bear or any CBD if you take too much of a CBD product like it's too strong for you one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness so when you first start with CVD I was highly highly highly recommend you tried in the evening before you go to bed and not when you're operating any heavy machinery like a car so I start I usually tell people start with a 10 milligram if you do start to think you're feeling drowsy you can always cut it in half I take ten milligrams during the day for random things and then I'll take a 20 milligram gummy at night for sleep if I really want a really amazing sleep I may take a 25 milligram gummy so I'll just show you quickly like what the gummy bears look like so you know so these are these are our 10 milligram gummy bears this is just like a regular gummy bear that you would find like Hasbro gummy bear the ones at the movie theaters we sell these in a regular flavor and a sour flavor sour bear flavor as well and those are really good they taste like sour patch kids our 5 milligram gummy is also a sour patch it's a sour patch kid that's a 5 milligram gummy we've had some parents use those on their children for like a DD or anxiety I'm not advocating that you should use them on your children but I'm just saying that if you do want to use them on your children start with the 5 milligrams you'll also see like we have watermelon gummy bears and these are these are 10 milligram gummies as well just like the regular bears but they taste like watermelon so like I said each gummy bear just has a different flavor profile and then we have a 20 milligram profile gummy bear and then these are our 25 milligram gummy bears so these are apple rings tastes just like an apple ring smells like an apple ring we also have these in peach rings those are delicious too those will put you out I shouldn't say that they put me out I don't know if they'll put you out so it's just all about trying and testing so like I said I suggest a 10 milligram one see if it works if you're feeling more relaxed but it's not really putting you to sleep then take 2 at night you can take 3 at night if you want to as well and then once you figure out how many you need then you can come back and get a 20 or 25 milligram gummy as well so I hope that helps I didn't bring them here but I should have but we also have chocolate almonds those are 20 milligrams so if you prefer something sweet at night or something sweet during the day just be careful you don't have too many and then we also have a peppermint and our peppermints are actually butter mints and those are 50 milligrams and they have a little melatonin in them too so those are really great if you really really struggle with sleep and you really want to be knocked out but I'm gonna caveat all of this CBD doesn't work on everyone everybody everybody is different right how they react to CBD so I could be telling you a 15 milligram peppermint will put me out for like 6 7 hours it may not work on you and that's just something you're just gonna have to try CBD and see and I can't I can't tell you if it's gonna work on you or not so give it a try though I mean you have nothing to lose everything is 15 percent off on our site right now during the coronavirus chaos because we understand everybody is very anxious and stressed out right now and having trouble sleeping I can attest to that and just yeah let us know if you have any questions hit us up support at my pain center calm you can send us a DM on Instagram Twitter Facebook my pain center and we'll talk to you soon take care of have a good weekend and stay safe guys stay safe I don't know what I'm doing I'm sorry", "hn7KXpJiAnA": "test test test light light light light record record record i sent seven cbd gummies to two independent labs to see if they're real i actually sent a bunch of gummies for testing from seven different cbd companies but you you know what i mean i tested them last year but i'm just getting the results up now because i'm lazy by the way i have a new channel that i'll link to below it's just for my own entertainment really i like making videos on investing okay i paid for the products i paid for the lab test and this is not sponsored youtube these uh tests are provided by certified labs for educational purposes only and i am not promoting these legal hemp products many of which you advertise on your platform so please don't censor this video pretty please thank you let's start with the biggest failure here everyone loves to see a train wreck right veritas farms failed the funny thing is that veritas means truth study your latin veritas farms 2f scores by two independent labs we are screwed no hey i don't want to hear that defeatist attitude i want to hear you upbeat we're screwed when people ask me what the difference is between the independent labs that i pay directly versus the lab scores that companies pay for this this is it now if the gummies are not consistent if they're not thoroughly mixed they may see large differences in both lab scores not all gummies are equal when they're not all mixed perfectly the lab scores will always be slightly different especially with edibles and i'm just reporting on the findings from two very credible labs in california gummies are different sizes slightly so we weigh them and average them out it's not perfect by any means however up to 95 percent more is bad like award-winning bad these gummies were supposed to be five milligrams but each lab found over nine milligrams of cbd no bueno not good because you don't know what what's going to be in your next gummy what will it have you don't know they have since updated their package to say 9 milligrams of cbd so i don't know if they accidentally gave me the new formula if they were in the middle of a change or what but this one is a no-go for me if you want to see the full review or any of the official lab tests head on over to cbdxamen.com also share this video to help this movement because people like you deserve to know if your cbd is real okay uh cbd living it's a big brand lab a lab a found 31 percent less lab b found 11 less i thought that was a little weird to be so far off meaning probably inconsistencies in the gummy so i did a really quick google search and i found at least six lab reports that found this company has issues that was just a few seconds of searching they failed a bunch of investigations like mine so you can read the whole review at cbdxamin.com but why why why do you want to know what this tastes like it tastes pretty good actually or what it costs it costs more than the average cbd gummy next next next let's just move on to the next we'll go with charlotte's web the biggest name in the hemp game they had about 20 more total cannabinoids than their label suggested which is typical of them i've tested a bunch of their product products over the years and they do run a little hot first off the label here says 10 milligrams and then 60 gummies everyone's going to think this has 600 milligrams of cbd but it only has 300 milligrams total right 300 milligrams on the front stop confusing people also tell me how much cbd is in each one and not just the total canned monoids but anyway small complaints it is 14.4 cents per milligram of cbd average is 13 cents according to my analysis of 450 cbd edibles charlotte's web is expensive but it is a premium brand so what are you gonna do now here's the deal with gummies this is the gram breakdown gummies are big so the amount of cannabinoids per gram is low it's below the reporting level for lab b for most of these other cannabinoids but it does add up it adds up because each gummy is four milligrams or four grams i should say a serving is two gummies eight grams so you're getting according to lab a 12 milligrams of total cannabinoids including 10.4 milligrams of cbd and 0.4 milligrams of thc that's nice plus 0.7 milligrams of cbc and a little cbg 0.12 milligrams of cbg so it adds up to a nice full spectrum but it's like they're low strength oils the dose the dose wise so just be aware that i showed the gram breakdown but the gummies each gummy is multiple grams depending on how big it is now this is actually good for gummies really good but charlotte's web is famous for their high levels of additional cannabinoids the question is for all gummies do you want to pay that much extra every day and obviously 10 milligrams of cbd is a lowish dose you can get their bigger potent oils for as low as 5 cents per milligram some brands go as low as 2 cents per milligram of cbd so 14 cents yeah it's a lot but uh these are gummies and not just oil gummies have added value because they taste good and these by the way taste great very smooth natural type of flavor made with beet sugar they are ginger flavor with a subtle turmeric taste just a little bit of that weird turmeric taste and just a tad of hem flavor but it's not it's not too bad for all the cannabinoids in here it's actually phenomenal i think it's great but if you don't like natural flavors you just get out of here walk away from this one oh and they also have a raspberry sleep flavor one sleep gummies these are fantastic they do help me with sleep most of the time they work not every time but most of the time and i think they taste a little better too raspberries are better flavor than turmeric right and there's only a few left that's how much i like them the one thing with all these gummies i chew on them and leave the juice in my mouth for a minute the capilla it sounds weird but the capillaries in your mouth are significantly better at absorbing cbd than your stomach is some studies show up to double the absorption rate i don't know what it actually is but it's a lot more than just eating cbd like like an animal like a savage animal just don't swallow it i don't know how am i supposed to say this so just don't swallow it for a minute don't edit that out now if you need large amounts of cbd you should really be using an oil also to find your correct dose an oil you can change the dose i was initially against gummies for that reason but i've been using all these gummies and more for the last six months and they're fun they're easy they taste good let's go the next one rnr medicinals i originally found this brand on amazon and i was shocked by how good their test results were they didn't list cbd levels on their website at the time which many companies don't because of marketing regulations so i couldn't give them a great review but now they are very transparent about cbd levels and they've got a usda organic cert and a us hemp authority search now these guys are less than half the cost of charlotte's web they're full spectrum well they have a fraction of the amount of additional cannabinoids that charlotte's web has at least in their gummies but that's normal they actually uh have more cannabinoids than the majority of other brands out there but it's still trace amounts 25 milligrams of cbd per gummy is strong that's a good dose i like that now if the lab shows it's five percent off that's still very accurate for edibles it's not going to be exact exact and their oils have shown that they test very accurately in the past now the good news is there's no hemp flavor they taste like those sour strips the sour belt candy that you would get at any big candy store if you want a lot of cannabinoids just get one of their oils and have their gummies for fun their oils have a ton of cannabinoids in a more than charlotte's web even and they're a fraction of the price of most companies gummies are for fun and these are a great price from a super consistent company with tons of positive reviews okay social cbd big brand this is broad spectrum meaning cbd and other cannabinoids but no thc and it does have zero thc and it looks like it's just isolated cbd that adds up to about 23 milligrams per serving and some isolated cbg which adds up to 1.36 milligrams per serving those really add up when you times them by 10 the serving is 10 grams or two gummies and that's a grand total of 24.28 milligrams of total cannabinoids so right on the money they're supposed to be uh 25 milligrams in a serving claimed not bad price is 9 cents per milligram under that 13 average so decent the red raspberry flavor taste was good i like it it's like a red vine zero hemp flavor yeah these are pretty good let's go with the next one cbdmd huge brand one of the first to go mainstream these tasted super good tropical mix from organic cane sugar and organic fruit no hemp taste zero hemp taste they say they're broad spectrum which should have other cannabinoids but this is just pure cbd that's typical of most broad spectrums and that's why i talk so much trash about most broad spectrums but who am i to judge how their marketing team uses cannabis terminology now cbd itself has no flavor so there's no reason all pure cbd products shouldn't taste this good but for some reason some cbd companies they just don't know how to do the candy business i tell you 10.4 cents per milligram is under the average 13 cents super accurate a scores from both labs and super tasty if you want pure cbd at an okay price this one's good okay next oh medterra you disappointed me not not in a bad way but this is one of my favorite companies this is the brand that i recommend most to people who can't have any thc in their systems drug tests or they're scared they might enjoy it too much or other reasons medterra is big reliable and they've tested squeaky clean at my labs in the past all their products have and that's why i recommend them for people that can't test positive for thc okay again they test accurately and it's uh they just have a little bit more and it's pure cbd a little cbdv is normal in those cbd isolates it's structurally similar to cbd and considered pure cbd over 27 milligrams per gummy it's supposed to be 25 milligrams so that's good tad more the price the price is under 5 cents excellent this would be my favorite for a pure gummy great company reliable it tastes like a gummy little gummy bear with no hemp flavor zero and but then they add l-theanine it's just an amino acid found in tea it can help calm you but these gummies have a slightly bitter aftertaste like tea i don't know if it's related to the l-theanine or not the taste is actually good overall it's um it's decent but why this is uh one of the best pure cbd companies out there that i've found why add other stuff to your product please medterra stop stop this madness and just make good old-fashioned cbd gummies with no added crap i do feel like it was calming like a natural calming so this is still an excellent product but just not for me okay that's it i think i like the charlotte's web the most just for all those uh extra cannabinoids even though it is weird with the tumeric and hemp taste but uh i wouldn't buy it personally because i'm cheap so uh for me i'd go with the uh the rnr medicinals personally it was just uh it's just like candy the cbd md that was which guy here cmd cbd md was good for uh pure cbd and it tasted good even though they lie about broad spectrum yeah who who am i kidding i'd uh i'd eat all of these i'll leave and probably eat the rest of these even though the lab says they're completely unreliable veritas okay i will see you next time you wonderful person you you", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews

components so these are really really good you", "nHJxUx_vpjg": "Hey guys! Welcome back to Remedy Review.\nMy name is Melena, and today we're gonna be reviewing the Sunday Scaries CBD\ngummies. So, previously on this channel we've reviewed a lot of CBD oils from\ndifferent brands, and what we've talked about a lot when it comes to taking a\nCBD tincute is the taste of it. It can tend to have a very earthy, natural\nflavor that some people don't love, and CBD gummies are a great way to combat\nthat and still get a dose of CBD without the hemp flavor. So, when it comes\nto CBD gummies, Sunday Scaries definitely have some of the best\nproducts on the market, and people love these gummies. Here we have both of their\ntraditional formula and their vegan gummies as well. They each contain 10\nmilligrams in every gummy, and there's 20 gummies in every bottle. So, I'm just\ngonna open these up and show you the differences between the two, how they\nlook, and then I'm gonna try them as well to compare the taste. So, okay, so\nbasically the traditional one is a little little gummy bear, and then the\nvegan looks like a gumdrop. So, I'll just try this one first... Probably one of my favorite videos because I\njust get to eat gummies. Tastes really good. Tastes like a regular gummy bear\npretty much but you get the added benefits of CBD. It was also red and red's my favorite\nflavor of gummies...or well, maybe cherry. Red's not really a flavor, but, ok. Oh, ok,\nthat one tasted really good, too! Especially because it was like lemony,\nand I love lemon. I would say the biggest difference is there's a slight kind of\ndifference in consistency, but...I'm sorry I'm just like chewing and trying to talk.\nThis one has a little bit of a sour coating, which is a really nice switch up\nfrom the traditional formula. But, yeah, overall they both tasted really good and\nI'll be taking these home with me now! So, a couple of other things that I want to\nhighlight about Sunday Scaries gummies is that they are completely THC free. And you can view all of their lab test results online for their individual products, so\nyou can dive a little deeper into the cannabinoid profile if you want to look\nat that. They also have a lot of other helpful ingredients that are natural to\nhelp you kind of have just an internal balance like vitamins D3 and B12. That's\nanother reason I like to take these it's 'cause I'm pretty sure...I mean I feel like\neveryone kind of has vitamin deficiencies, so this is a nice way to\njust feel like you're getting more than just CBD you're also getting other\nhealthy and natural ingredients as well. Okay, so now let's talk pricing. So, the\noriginal formula here is $39 for one bottle and the vegan is $44.00. But with that\nbeing said, you can also opt to get a subscription for either of these\nproducts where they'll send them to you with free shipping every month, and you\nalso get them at a cheaper cost. So, if you do the subscription - the original\nformula is $31.00, and then the vegan one is $35.00. So, yeah, a little bit of difference in\nprice there, but not a big change. I think the most important thing is that you can\ndefinitely cancel the subscription at any time, so you're not locked into that\nwhich is a great option to have and it's just a great way to get a consistent\ndose of CBD if you're looking to take it long-term. So, when it comes to taking CBD\ngummies in general they're definitely a discreet, tasty way to easily manage your\ndose of CBD, and when it comes to Sunday Scaries gummies, in particular , they definitely taste great, they have a vegan option, which is awesome, and they're also\nTHC free. Plus, they're the remedy that makes life not so scary!

Welcome back to the Remedy\nReview channel. Today, I'm going to be going over my top three favorite CBD\ngummies of all time. So, the first of our three CBD gummies up here is literally\nfrom Seabedee. Yeah, play on words, fun name. I love their branding and their products,\nespecially their neon gummy bears. They also have some peach rings that are\nreally great, but I like these just because you get more of them in the pack,\nand they're all multicolored, different flavors, and they just taste really\nreally amazing. They kind of have a little bit of a sour coating, and they\ntaste better than probably every other regular just gummy bear I've ever tried!\nAnd they're THC free, and they have 10 milligrams in each gummy, so I'm just\ngonna open this real quick just kind of show you what they look like, and\nprobably just take one for myself. Devon you might have to...Oh, I got it! Okay, alright, okay.\nI'm definitely gonna try a blue one 'cause that's like one of my favorites. But look\nat how cute this is! It's...it's like the perfect shape of a bear. Anyway... Can you hear the ASMR chewing? So, next up\nwe have cbdMD. These are their 750 milligram gummies for the whole bottle,\nso there's 25 milligrams per gummy. They also have a couple different strengths -\none that's lower, like 300 for one bottle which is 10 milligrams each, and the\nsuper-strong one that's kind of newer that has 50 milligrams per gummy. So, if\nyou're really looking for something strong, they have it at cbdMD. Yeah, these\nare also made with broad spectrum CBD so they're THC free! And they have assorted\nflavors of like strawberry, tropical, raspberry, orange. Yeah, they taste really\ngood also. Should I try one? I'm just I wasn't gonna try all these but now I'm\njust here and they smell kind of good. They smell really good! But these I kind of use just on a daily basis...if they're...if I'm at work or\nsomething they definitely stay on my work desk. So, if I need a little a little\nsomething extra to help me calm down when I'm stressed during the work week,\nthese are what I reach for. And then last but not least, at the end of the day I'm\na big fan of these MedTerra CBD gummies. They're actually a new release,\ndefinitely the new kid on the block out here, but I really like them already.\nThese are strawberry flavored, and they also have other ingredients to help you\nsleep like chamomile, and lemon balm, and just a little bit of melatonin - not\nenough to make you go groggy in the morning, but just overall all of the\ningredients in here kind of work together to just help you get a restful\nnight's sleep. So, that's what I really like to use them for. Oh, yeah, I mean they\nhave a very strong strawberry scent but I love that because strawberry is really\nfun. They're also definitely the squishiest out of the bunch, yeah, but I\nmean they're gummies! Oh sh*t. I probably shouldn't have taken that because\nit's a sleep gummy but whatever. It's fine. It's Thursday... it's almost Friday. Still good though! At this point... That was...yeah, I probably shouldn't have done that. But I just wanted to really... anyway thanks for\nwatching! Alright! So, I'm about to go take a nap! and I... So, all in all, these three CBD\ngummies are just kind of my personal favorites, but if you guys have any other\ntop brands that you really like, any of their gummies or edibles in general\nplease share with us in the comments below!

YouTube video today this video is actually sponsored by jefes just kidding it's not actually sponsored by hemp-based but I will be reviewing couple of their products yeah I give this video a thumbs up and subscribe if you like this video if you don't please still subscribe but yeah let's get started the first item that I will be reviewing for you guys today or the premium vegan CBD gummies they do come in the flavor of mango lemon lime raspberry and strawberry I believe I was actually really skeptical about taking these gummies because usually like any CBD gummy or THC gummy that I have tried in the past there are tends to be like a weird aftertaste to a lot of them but this one actually didn't which was really surprising and they tasted pretty good I could take one out for you guys just so you guys could see I know right now they are having a sale and this one will be 33 dollars but usually it's around 39 which is a cop but I guess the only downside to these are the sugar or like the sprinkle of crystals I don't really know what this thought that's called but it tends to get all over your fingers when you do eat it but like that's like the only bad thing and that's just me being petty about it but these gummies are pretty fire and I would recommend it if you you are an avid CBD user or you want to get into trying out CBD then go for it I feel like these gummies are pretty fire and it's affordable and I went ahead and looked at everyone's reviews and it seems like a lot of people actually do love this product and so one through 10 I would probably give this item like an 8 which is pretty good so it looks like this so the next item that I will be reviewing for you guys today is the CBD cooling cream this product has 500 milligrams of CBD it looks like this this this product has like a cooling sensation and then it's supposed to relieve any pain and your joints or your muscles I did try it on on couple other people just because I don't want to be like bias about this product and so far everyone has given in so far everyone has really loved this item this product is kind of like a tiger balm vibe or you put it on and then it like creates a cooling sensation and whatever pain kind of goes away I would probably recommend it putting on this item like before or after workouts if you guys feel like a sore sensation but I was able to try this product on my boyfriend because he recently had a sleeve retouched up but we definitely waited like a day or two to put it on because I feel like if we you apply it on an open wound it's kind of obviously gonna stain and so we wait a couple days and what we did apply it he really loved the product same with my housemate he has knee joint problems and we've been applying it every single day he said that his pain has been he like he's been seeing results so if you do feel any pain or if you have any swords and you want to relieve that I would definitely recommend this cream right now this cream is going for $30 and it is on sale it's usually $35 so if you guys want to check it out I will link all the items down below so you guys can purchase it if you want I think this is one of my favorite products so far out of the batch that I did get and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and families I really don't want to recommend you guys products that I don't believe in and I did see results with those when they're 10 this cream would be like a nine so that is the other product so for the third product I got was this cherry amaretto hemp extract oil it looks like this it's called milk but the flavor is cherry amaretto I don't know how this has ten calories I guess like you can eat it oh my god you eat it you eat this I've been putting it on my wrist wow I am dead I literally thought you put this on your skin so I've been literally putting it on my wrist but you do drop this into like cocktails or any drinks this is edible so all my research on this item I clearly didn't research this item I actually researched all of them bled this one because I was like it's an oil extract like this is so easy like I could easily talk about it but yeah this has 250 milligrams of hemp extract oil I'm definitely gonna retry this item I was gonna say this item wasn't like I wouldn't probably not purchase this item because I felt like I didn't really experience like the CBD effects and that's because I was putting it on my body like you're supposed to eat it or like like consumed this item and I didn't know it was edible at all so yeah because I was looking at this and I was like why is it 10 calor why do they put that it's 10 calories like it made no sense to me but I was like whatever okay and I was like applying it but apparently you put in your drinks I'm not a huge CBD user but I have tried before I don't like consistently use CBD items because I lean towards THC but I have been putting a hold or I've been kind of weaning off of using THC so right now the CBD oil is going for $15 it is not on sale but so far it looks like on there [Music] it literally says on here add two drops of carrier maretto oil drops to eight ounces of ginger ale sprite or coconut lacrosse for Lacroix for mocktail packed with 20 milligrams of CBD dropped directly under your tongue for a faster calm I literally have been putting this on my skin I really shouldn't be doing a review just on this item but I was gonna say it wasn't my favorite because I didn't feel the effects now I know why check out the item I'm gonna link it down below and if you are interested it's gonna be in the description box for you guys so the next item that I got was this animoso recovered disposable vape pen I actually don't have the vape pen on me I left it back at home I did use it this vape pen is going for 25 dollars right now it is on sale it's usually $30 it says on their site that it's packed with Clementine and grapefruit flavoring but I kind of only tasted the grapefruit but I feel like you can't really taste that much when you're vaping unless it's like a puff or something and it's like packed with like artificial flavors or something like that you know um what I recommend this disposable vape pen probably not honestly I mean if you're a vapor and you like if your favorite I would recommend this item it's not too strong and it's packed with 200 milligrams of hemp extract so it kind of looks like this the product so if you wanted to see what it looks like it's red and it says hemp base right there um kind of gives me like supreme vibes but so far a lot of people actually love this item but yeah this is my last item if I were to rank all my products that I got from head base I would say the cooling cream was one of my favorites and then I would say that gummy was and then this pen was third coming up third and then coming up last was the extract but also it's because I wasn't properly using it but yeah I would recommend CBD if you have a lot of anxiety or PTSD like personally I have been dealing with very serious anxiety for many many years and I know what it feels like just like waking up and like having all these like thoughts or like staying up and just being anxious all the time and I feel like I you lucked to a lot of different things in my life but I would recommend CBD it's like the safest route because like when I do use THC products are like when I do smoke weed or whatever like I feel like I get more paranoid and like I get my anxiety actually comes back even harder okay so I'm gonna be trying the cherry amaretto oil extract I just want to try and maybe we'll see like the effects it's it like recommends if you want like a faster effect to put it under your tongue but I don't really want to do that so I'm just gonna go ahead and put it in my coffee right now Wendie minutes lay down so I had a Starbucks cream because I don't like that - no kidding I had a Starbucks drink and I did put four drops of the hemp extract oil and I it's

one\nthey're easy to take some people have difficulties remembering to take their\ncbd on a daily basis if you're already familiar with taking\nvitamins or morning pills it may be an easier habit to integrate\ncbd gummies into your daily lifestyle versus an oil number two\nour gummies come in an assortment of fruity flavors and\nare delicious they're all vegan no animal by-products\nand they have zero bitter aftertaste number three well unfortunately in some\nsocial circles there may still be a negative social\nstigma tied to cbd oil so taking gummies is a more discreet way\nto ingest your cbd pulling one out of your pocket and\npopping into your mouth probably won't catch eyes\nat work or in public like an oil would number four the benefits of cbd last a\nlittle bit longer with gummies because of the way they're ingested they\nare metabolized through your liver versus oils that can get in your\nbloodstream sublingually that's under your tongue\nand number five it's often easier to measure\nyour dosage with gummies if a gummy has 25 milligrams of cbd\nlike ours do you know the precise dose when you eat one or two\nyou also have the option to eat a half a gummy or even a quarter

"SqQQ24elTUQ": "hi there and welcome to Green Valley nation my name is Jennifer Dixon and today we are going to talk about the joy organics premium hemp gummies in the serene orchard flavors but before we do make sure you like and subscribe to this channel the joy organics premium hemp serene orchard gummies contain 20 milligrams of a broad spectrum CBD product that is organically grown right here in the US another really great thing about these gummies is that they are naturally flavored and sweet so there are no artificial flavorings or sweetening now joy organics was founded by a grandmother joy who had trouble sleeping and she had some residual pain in her shoulder so the conventional methods she tried everything she tried didn't work and that is when she went to work trying to develop a product that one stuck to her wellness and natural minded proclivities but also really really worked so you will find a really large variety of products inside the joy organics website they have these gummies they have tinctures they have nano emulsified technology products in there soft gels they contain a huge variety of products that are all broad-spectrum that means they go through great lengths to keep the cannabinoid profile of the industrial hemp plant in place they just remove the THC they do use co2 extraction to get the cannabinoids out of the hemp plant but it is all organically grown and it's right here in the US so what exactly are the joy organics serene orchard gummies these are super super simple gummies in fact there are only eight ingredients the first three of which are apple juice agave and stevia so it's a very simple natural product that is a great way for you to get your CBD supplement in in a controlled and can way each of the gummies there are 15 in this container come in a little bitty plastic bottle that fits basically on the palm of your hand it is really convenient I love it because you can just toss it in your bag and go it's really convenient and each gummy again contains about 20 milligrams of CBD now the thing that you do want to keep in mind is when you eat the CBD when you ingest it like with these gummies it might take a little bit more time for you to receive the benefits of the product so compared to like a vape which is almost instantaneous or an oil which is within a few minutes when you utilize a gummy or an edible it could take a half an hour to an hour to really see the benefits of this product now let's talk a little bit more about what's in this bottle when you order it you will get in this little clear container and it will have a little seal on top of it you do get 15 milligrams of CBD and on the bottom of the bottle you will see some numbers right here at the bottom of this little container if you take your phone and scan the QR code or if you are on the joy organics website they will actually have a link to the test results which is where this QR code takes you you will be able to find everything you need to know about what is actually inside these gummies another cool thing about the joy organics website is right on the main product page they have a summary of the test results and then if you scroll down underneath the facts there is a direct link to their trust results which is where you can type in this number right now joy organics does only ship to the US they have three retail operations and they offer wholesale opportunity so you could get it in a local CBD shop near you possibly let's talk just a moment about the test results so one thing that is really cool that I thought about the test results is that it prefers the different levels of the different cannabinoids and terpenoids did positive for CVG CBC and CBN and although the science or some the science but the study perhaps of the cannabinoids specifically cbgc B and C BC and even CBD are very very new the fact is preliminary evidence suggests that each of these cannabinoids are very beneficial to our body and so I loved the fact that this wasn't just a CBD isolate this actually had different cannabinoids with the idea being that the different cannabinoids all in your system all together will actually help to enhance the overall effect of the supplement so you can find all of that again on the analysis which you can locate easily by scanning the QR code or going to the product page but guess what we've made it even easier if you check out the written review located at Green Valley nation.com we actually have a copy of the test results for this lot so you don't even have to go anywhere else you just click on that link right below this video but before you do make sure you subscribe to this channel so let's talk just a second about what it's like to actually supplement with the Joye organics gummies so when you get it again it is sealed and they are not exactly like gummy bears like you may remember as a child they're their little round almost ambery brown colors that kind of stick together most of mine actually did stick together the very first time I took these I wasn't really paying attention I was on my way out the door and it was gonna be a busy day I had already forgotten my CBD so I just kind of grabbed these and then throw them in the bag while first of all tossing one into my mouth I'm not going to lie it was not the most pleasant experience the first time I it actually gave me pause because I thought oh but I don't love stevia or agave much to my father's chagrin like I really don't like the flavor of either of those sweeteners although I know they are much better for you so keep in mind if you do use this product you will definitely taste the agave and the stevia the thing that I absolutely loved about it was about half an hour 45 minutes later I woke enough with the hip pain it was gone and I had to go teach a yoga class within 45 minutes and I was a little bit worried that morning because my was hurting but I was able to teach that entire class pain free because of these gummies and it lasted me through lunch a little bit you know about nap time for my kids so I really loved the fact that it lasted all day I have been able to take these for the last couple of weeks do you know just as I needed for pain or whatever and every single time I have taken them it has reduced or eliminated all of the pain that I had specifically in my hip in my low back so I really loved it however I have not gotten used to these gummies the stevia and the agave flavor they are strong so although apple juice is the main ingredient it's the first ingredient so there's the most apple juice in here out of all the other ingredients the fact is the stevia and the agave flavor it is strong so keep that in mind if you don't love that flavor the benefit of it is I don't taste any of the earthy flavors that's commonly found in even gummies or other CBD products so you know it's a it's a balance right so this is a supplement and it's used to help calm you down reduce anxiety maybe perhaps it can reduce pain so if you think about it more like this is my supplement it's like my protein shake I'm just gonna drink it it makes it a little bit easier they are easy to take because it is a good size and they go down relatively easy so let's talk about a few reasons why I think you should try this joy organics premium hemp serene orchard gummies first of all these puppies are convenient there are this plastic case it's small enough it can throw into your purse you can put it in your diaper bag you don't have to worry about it these are really convenient and they work within an hour easily you will notice the difference whether you're stressed out or there's pain you will definitely notice a difference now for those of you that are very very wellness or health conscious and you don't want any artificial sugars or even processed sugars this is another great option for you why because there's only eight ingredients the first three of which are apple juice agave and stevia like it really doesn't get much more basic than that these are vegan and forget they are made in a pharmaceutical grade compounding facility so that means that every single time you get a gummy it's gonna look the same it's gonna smell the same it's gonna taste the same and it's going to give you the exact same results so these are some really great reasons to use it the first and most probably the primary reason is the fact that this stuff works now let me talk to you about the things that you might want to consider when you're buying them the first one is if you do not like see if it stevia or agave you're gonna have a hard time with these because they are they taste like stevia and agave will just leave it like that so the flavor is definitely very strong but again it is a premium product that you know it's going to help you feel better the other thing you might want to keep in mind is these puppies are kind of expensive it is a premium product it is GMP certified so it's made in a really good facility but you're looking at about $3 or gummy which is kind of an investment considering the amount of CBD in each gummies so if you're on a budget these might not be the best idea for you because they are a little bit more expensive however you are getting some high quality CBD in these products it is all organic every single product inside this bottle is organic it has grown inside the US it is manufactured inside the US and so it is the quality control measures they cost something so if that's something that's very important to you the cost isn't going to bother you as much because it works and you know exactly what you're getting every single time you open this bottle so here are a few quick facts about the joy organics serene orchard gummies they come in 15 gummies per container they are broad-spectrum so that means you get the full cannabinoid profile of the hemp plant however they virtually eliminated the THC in fact it tests negative for THC in the test results they come in at about three dollars a gummy they are vegan they are manufactured in a GMP certified facility and they are all grown inside the US with a hundred percent organic hemp in fact this entire product is a hundred percent organic thank you so much for watching this review I hope you enjoyed it and maybe you learned something new and I'm really curious to know if you have tried these things and if the flavor was as strong to you I know everybody has kind of different flavor profile discretions but these had a really strong flavor however they worked like every single time I've taken one and I've given my husband one and I've given a couple of friends some they work inside of an hour the like if you're feeling super stressed which was me today like I just calmed down so these things work but they don't taste good so I'm just curious to know what you think of them

soon take care bye bye [Music]", "-oohjzQjDMs": "so to begin you're going to need your bare molds your dropper a knife a spoon a whisk if you're using gelatin you'll want to get out your gelatin if you're using jello get off your jello packet if you're using gelatin you probably want flavoring like mayo a half tea of mayo a third of a cup of water you'll want to have your cbd isolate also a sensitive scale and a ziploc bag to put on top now you'll want to spray your molds with non-stick pam or other oil this is a third of a cup of water and half a tablespoon of mayo now what you're going to want to do is slowly mix in the gelatin to prevent it from clumping so we're going to do one tablespoon of gelatin second tablespoon of gelatin third tablespoon of gelatin you want to make sure that all the gelatin gets wet you don't want any dry gelatin and then i'm going to add roughly another half tablespoon so the consistency that you're going for is you want it to be kind of like porridge or oatmeal you want it to be thick scrape that off and now we're going to microwave this so we've microwaved this for 30 seconds you can see how it's liquidy now uh i want to get all the gels melted spoons i'm going to sort of stir it around in here i'm going to use the whisk to help scrape it off so 30 seconds you shouldn't have any trouble with the gelatin the second 30 seconds you need to watch the gelatin to make sure that it doesn't boil over in the microwave so the gelatin will start to foam and boil as soon as you see the gelatin rising go ahead and hit stop in the microwave so we're microwaving for our second 30 seconds and we're going to watch it because near the end it should start to foam and boil all right you see that it's starting to boil starting to grow just make sure it doesn't go over the bowl so we're stirring you can see the mixture is very liquidy i'm going to put that aside we're going to measure out the cbd now we're using a ziploc bag to make it easy to transfer the cbd into not gonna scale all messy so where we want two grams which happens very quickly so we're just measuring out two grams here's why you need a sensitive scale too much this should be close to two grams so you can fold the bag get it all back on the scale okay there we go 1.99 there's a little bit here that's off the scale that'll include so we've got roughly 2 grams put that directly into the cbd get a little bit off the lid and we're going to stir it in so you don't want any clumps i want everything to be uniform so we're stirring really aggressively here we want everything to be mixed in now if your gelatin is cooled you can microwave this again or if it's still fairly liquid you can start putting them into the molds just like that i like to do five at a time for each dropper and uh if it gets too solid or it gets too thick to work with just microwave it again keep an eye on it make sure that it doesn't boil over and microwave as many times as you need to keep it nice and easy to work with we've got our bear molds filled we're going to put these in the refrigerator flat for 20 minutes they're still somewhat liquid so don't lift them up or else the gelatin will fall out of the mold so keep these flat in the refrigerator for 20 minutes so it's been 20 minutes the bears are solid and now we just pop them out i used like to use a paper towel and just start pushing on the molds to pop all the bears out and they should be nice and solid they should easily come out if they don't easily come out then you didn't use enough non-stick spray in the beginning and so we just pop all the bears out if there's any little dots like this on the mold you can just pull that off as well and there you go 129 bears which makes each bear roughly 15.5 milligrams of cbd now you want to take these and put these in the refrigerator don't leave them out they will eventually grow mold if you leave them out for too long my last test they grew mold in roughly two weeks but if you keep them in the refrigerator they should last for months", "aaOsASispno": "[Music] okay guys welcome back the supplement review now this week we have something a little bit different these are CBD Yanni's called calm before the storm in the chaos crew you may remember them there's a brand that brought us bringing the chaos pre-workout and we've also been testing their new my stint as well so I'm really excited to try these because bring the chaos with one of my favorite pre-workout stew last year now these are CBD gummies that CBD oil is a non psychoactive version cannabis oil so you shouldn't get them high in order to go too much into CBD I'm gonna leave that the guys from Kaos crew this video benefits of CBD dummies and I'm gonna be doing for the next 20 nights they recommended me to take one before bed you've got 25 milligrams of CBD oil in each one of these twenty gummies in the packet variety different flavors I wanted to open the video hey guys Stephen here from Kaos crew on cheap chefs nutrition and today at Eric is doing a review on or Kaos crew sweetie guys we've had them out for a while and I as you can see they look like sweets but they're definitely enough to keep you keep them away from kids anybody bought them so each one of them is infused with 25 25 milligrams of CBD which is quite high and just to put that in perspective here's another brand of CBD where we do it's a 500 milligram 30 30 milliliter and so each full drop gives you 16 milligrams of CBD and for a good oil and you care and the faith holders milligram range that you know that's what you'll be getting about 16 milligrams they can pay 10 milligram are you know 10 ml a liter bottles out of Holland board but you're not going to get very much CBD so 25 ml and won't call me is a lot going on the rest a minute you know somebody you know I basically I use things in a tank for sleeping to begin with I think it started with off would call me and it was Fame at the minute a use about one so just to begin with half ago me brownie but are you just the tried out if somebody's gonna be a bit bigger manifold full coming and we sell them most like a recovery a recovery go me for after trainin and to bring you down and after the chaos of the pre-work right and what chow anybody can use these and I can make medical claims on this or gets classified as in Madison so you know I can't say this can help with anxiety what else yeah snapping you need to be living under a rock enough to know the facets of CBD there's a lot of CBD on the market there's a lot of crop pollen Bart you can't wait to pay off or even with the likes of this this is fine for you general sort of stuff but my facts is if somebody is in a lot of p.m. and things like that and you're gonna want to go for a really a strength it something like a 1500 milligram 3,000 milligrams weight or something like that but for general use sleeping and sort of Lake sort of stuff recovery after tree mmm bring you down off the chaos this is the stuff and so hopefully you enjoy the review guys thanks so it's night one we're gonna open them up and have our first CBD gummy see it they taste like so much you open them up you get two packs of ten they're in their bags so let's open this up and try one so there we are each individual CBD gummy they're quite sticky let's give it the old taste test hmm taste why is very nice very sweet it's light off the taste but that's 25 milligrams somebody tells me this is gonna be a really good night sleep 1999 three trying out our gummies and yeah so far feel like I've slept a little bit deeper I haven't woken up as many times during the night yeah starting to really enjoy it a couple bills tonight so they're sticky and the chewy then he's gonna help me sleep okay so we're down to the last six I'm doing this I thought I think they're helpful to unwind in the day they seem to be helping me sleep a little bit deeper especially when you've been taking a hardcore pre-workout at like six seven o'clock in the evening and these help me calm down a little bit and for bed so the flavors are really good too so I think I'm gonna have green today today is the last day of the CBD Jionni's looking back on it they've kind of helped me to relax in the evening it doesn't make you sleepy it just kind of makes you calm it's always difficult when reviewing a recovery product to tell whether or not they're working what's attributable to the recovery product and moisture is natural recovery but overall I have enjoyed taking them a be interesting to see over the next few nights so I've stopped taking CVD how I sleep whether there's any noticeable difference when you finish in the course of Domi's here we go it's the last one okay so we've come to the end of our test of the CBD gummies from Kaos crew now in my research online there are a couple of things I came across that I thought it was worth touching on the first one is the issue of bioavailability of CBD when it's consumed orally now there are contrasting opinions on the effectiveness of edible CBD over CBD that you put underneath your tongue for example or CBD that you vape you take in through the lungs the main issue with edible CBD and CBD colonies is how much of that CBD is actually gonna make it into your system you're gonna lose a certain amount and the digestion process and then you're also going to metabolize a certain amount of that my benefits of vaping CBD and consuming CBD underneath your tongue but it absorbs straight to the blood vessels are that you will get a higher percentage of that CBD absorbed into your system however they come with their own drawbacks some people don't particularly enjoy vaping and I've heard from other people that they don't like the aftertaste that putting CBD under your tongue can give you again it's a matter of choice now how effective these gummies are for you is gonna depend on two things it's gonna depend on the amount of CBD that your system metabolizes and your sensitivity to CBD as you heard the guys at kau screw themselves say if you're looking for a high dose CBD then probably another product is for you if you're somebody who's using relax and to recover from sport than these may well be suitable personally my experience in using these was that it was enough I felt as you heard me say in the review that I was sleeping a little bit sounder that I was generally quite relaxed after I've taken it that's very difficult to say how much of that was [ __ ] bow and how much of that was genuine but given that I went into this with very sort of low expectation and I did feel a noticeable result that dropped off when I stopped taking it I feel like actually yeah for me these did yield the results now there $34.99 420 yummies so that works out to be about 1 pound 75 and 9 you can get that from the shapeshifter website I'm gonna put a link down below I'll also put some links to some different articles about the bioavailability of CBD when it's consumed orally so you guys can read and make your own mind up ok so in conclusion I enjoy taking these I felt that they did help me relax I thought they did help me sleep a little bit better as well especially when combined with natural ganda in fairness I haven't used the top side of the tongue so my experience with CBD is somewhat limited if you're in the market for CBD you like the sound of gummies you can check them out the shapeshifter website I put a link below thanks for checking out this review guys and I'll see you in the next video [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] panic spots place [Music]", "AFIp4GdoY-M": "[Music] hey guys what's up and welcome back to my channel I'm starting a new series where I'm going to try a bunch of things for 30 days first things I'm gonna be focusing on is CBE now I've heard of a lot of different TV products there's gummies there's oils there's edibles there's all kinds of things so in today's video we're going to be starting out with the gummies I'm gonna take these CBD not Pat gummies for one month and then I will let you guys know how I feel and I'm going to update you guys along the way and we will see what happened what's up guys I just got back from work a little bit ago and today is my second day taking the CBD gummies I only took two today I've actually just been taking two everyday because I feel like ten milligrams isn't enough but I don't want to go over too much I've seen people take crazy amounts one girl was like oh yeah I took 30 milligrams and that was enough for me I'm just gonna kind of experiment I guess that's what I've heard a lot of people do that's what it says to do on the website for the gummies the not pout W say to just you know kind of do whatever makes you feel best so I'm starting with two for the first while I might try three tomorrow and see I guess how I feel but so far what I want to say is that today out of all the days I've had lately it was a really good day and I don't know if it's because some like good things happened like you know I found out that I might get a raise soon and just a couple like good little things like that but it is kind of odd to me that like I have not been in good moods I have a lot of anxiety like I have a lot of mental breakdowns even just during the work day and today went really smoothly and I did take the gummies before work so it doesn't have to do with the CBD or is it like a placebo thing I don't know it might just be because there's been a couple of things that happen to me today I don't know but I'm gonna keep you guys updated and I'll talk to you in a couple days I guess okay bye what's up guys I look really gross I'm sorry I just got home from work and I've had a pretty bad headache I don't know I think it's just because I'm stressed out and that's probably why but yeah so this is like my first actual headache day where I'm gonna take some more of these because I took two of these earlier but I took them like really early in the day so I'm gonna try to take two more and now and see if it actually helps when I have a headache and I'll let you guys know and I don't want to look at myself in the mind anymore because like oh girl hard day I'm about to take my last to not pot gummies and then I'm gonna had to work and I will update you guys done okay I just ate one but I realize it was actually three because I'm trying to take the 30 milligram so yep last three meant to say what's up guys I am currently at work in the bathroom which is a really weird place system but I can't want to get in trouble there's cameras all around I know I shouldn't be filming at work my also and like trying to cover my work logo with this jacket like it's so hot at work I sweat oh my god so yeah I lost a lot of the footage I lost a lot of like the check-in footage so I'm doing a check-in today I took the CBD gummies about two hours ago so yeah I've been at work for about two hours and right now I'm feeling really great but at the same time I had a really good day today so that's the thing that gets me with the gummies aside it's like how do I know if it's work in if it's just my mood or if it's actually the gummies helping me but I did take thirty milligrams and I am feeling good and I don't like my job so I'm not always feeling good at work but like I actually do feel great today today's a good day look at my hair though like this is disgusting like I don't care when I come to work I don't care about my makeup I don't care what my hair I don't care what I wear I just come to work cuz like you guys I used to always get things out of this eventing machine but then one day my cousin got those cheddar and bacon things and they literally tasted so weird she's like dude taste these so I taste them yeah they were expired so now I'm like afraid of everything in here they tasted like dirt like I got one from a caveman not even kidding those now I'm just so afraid to ever touch those again let alone the vending machine that's a no-go for me I'll just start so these are my final thoughts on the knot pot gummies personally I did not experience anything that I thought was groundbreaking and really life-changing for me I have heard really good things about CBD oil which I really have not tried I think that two or three dummies just is not enough for me I would prefer to take more if possible because I didn't notice a significant change I obviously know that it's not supposed to make you high or anything like that you're not supposed to actually really feel anything but it's supposed to help with sleep anxiety and things like that I also did not notice me getting really tired when I would take these during the day so I don't know how well they really are for sleep if I ever do need sleep I usually take a melatonin but I heard that it's not good for you over time so even that I don't mess with too much but I'm usually pretty good about sleeping as far as helping with my anxiety I also did not notice a really big change with that I think a lot of the times my moods day-to-day depend on if I'm on my period what I'm going through in life during that time so yeah I just really did not notice a significant difference I just felt like there weren't many noticeable changes when I did take the CBD gummies but I did end up getting a third bottle right here which I might opt the dosage of it and see if that helps if so of course I will make like a follow-up but I just got this in the mail and I want to get this video off because actually these clips have been sitting in my computer for so long and I'm filming this outro quite a while later so I finished two empty bottles and this is gonna be my third bottle and then it comes with this bag is this guy cute you guys and then this also came with stickers this time so I really do like the little goodies that not pot throw is in it they're bands let me know if you guys have noticed anything when taking these specific gummies or if you've tried different gummies that work for you this is all based on my personal experience I'm sure that maybe there are other people whose bodies you know take the cvd differently and maybe these have worked for other people also I think I was going through a pretty rough time the last few months so I don't know but yeah let me know your experience as you guys and if you've had better experience with maybe the CBD oil and I'm definitely gonna try that I was thinking about maybe making another video that was very similar to this one where I kind of vlog each day when I take CBD oil and see if I notice a difference with that I also wanted to mention that my boyfriend has taken a few of these as well and he was not too crazy on the flavor of them and I don't think I am either they're okay they're not like horrible but they do kind of have a weird sort of like an aftertaste I can't really explain it they're supposed to taste like strawberry and they do but then they have this other weird kind of like a taste it's not horrible but it's just not super Pleasant either I don't know maybe it's just me my taste buds could be off so that's it for today's video thank you guys so so much for according me on watching my content let me know if there are any other videos that you want me to do that are similar to this I want to continue to do this kind of series where I try different things for maybe 30 days or kind of something that incorporates logging because I have really loved vlogging and I think that's super fun and

everyone's sheds and stuff didn't get blown away in the bad weather that we've just had so today let's get started on what we're going to be reviewing today we are looking at the CBD FX gummy bears these are great little products we've seen the effects I've been using these for over six months with my son he suffers with ADHD one before school seems to really set him down and he's doing really well on these so yeah a little bit about them so it's very in flavor I'm reading as well as talked to you guys I should know this product inside and out by now but it's 100% vegan which is good 300 milligrams total but that's in the whole pot there five milligrams each they're quite a low dose but perfect for children perfect for yourself a very easy way of working out how much CBD you're in taking a lot of my questions are you know what sort of dosage dosage should I take with CBD and really it's a bit of a trial and error situation there's a great link to dosage on our Facebook page so go and check that out that's very informative that's just proceeded eShop on Facebook you'll find us so add us on Facebook really good content on there but back to the dosage it's really a trial and error thing really you you're best off with like anything starting low and building yourself up until you see an improvement and basically these are a great way of doing that because you know you take one in the morning you know though five milligrams you take two in the morning you've antennae etcetera quick laughs so yeah it's pretty much it they are $44.99 on the website which is WWE but basically if you anyone that watches my channel wants to purchase from the website if they type in tube 10 at the end of the checkout with the basket you'll get 10% of each item so it's not only 10% off the full basket which most of our codes are I really love the YouTube community and oh where are hundreds of subscribers so we are getting there we are in the race to firown' top content of 2020 but yeah all joking aside yeah anyone that watches YouTube and wants to purchase from a website then just type in tube ten at the end and you'll get 10% off each individual item which is a fair amount of money so that's really good so far would you let's crack the pot open and get one of these a try now this isn't blind like I said I have tried them before because I tried them prior to letting my son have them in the mornings before school he's been on for about six months now he is massively better and this is only personal experience it's not gonna work for everyone I'm not a doctor or well I can relay is the the information that I read on a daily basis the articles the information and then obviously the feedback that I get from my customers and this customer even though he doesn't paint me isn't the Sun so yeah we've seen great results so on top you get a nice seal on there so you know that your product hasn't been tampered with what else they're burying flavor and another mention that there's no artificial sweeteners because that would be or sugars is its coating in sugars but there's no artificial no corn syrup you get sixty in a pot so even though its $49.99 it's quite good value if you're taking one per morning let's read their description these CBD gummy bears from CBD effects are easily and easily the tastiest purest most natural gummy bears available no corn syrup no artificial sweeteners no GMO and a hundred percent vegan a guilt-free CBD taste set sation wow they are so literally each Gomi contains five milligrams of foresee spectrum CBD so it's full spectrum such brilliant all of the guitar pins in there you can monitor your daily dose perfectly that's what I said yeah they must have ripped that from me these are also the perfect introduction for anybody who's interested in CBD yet edible herbs capsules allow convenience and control your doses click convenience and to control your doses are measured out equally so simply pop one in your mouth and you're ready to go capsules are best swallowed but gummy gummy tabs are good just to let melt in your mouth this will encourage the kind of a noise to quickly absorb in the bloodstream through the capillaries in the mouth they also taste delicious well we've said this so many times on this channel CBD with that earthy taste some people love it some people hate it's a Marmite situation so if you get like a drink or an edible I personally believe if it's if it tastes half decent and you're on to a winner so let's for a judoka Oh another interesting thing with CBD the CBD bomb just jumping on this review by healing cauldron so I don't know if you guys know I'm fashioning a beard I had a bit here that just wouldn't grow basically been robbing bomb into it this time round a lot beard and it's literally totally all covered in now like again I can't say it's gonna work for you this is personal experience I've had beards on and off for years and that patch there is never growing ever so I would like to say that it's due to healing cold and seemingly bomb check it out on the website alright anyway just crack this open oh I smell amazing yeah they smell really good just like pick-and-mix all right let's get one help show you guys up close the little bear there he is any child be happy to take know in the morning with their Pitman's hmm okay it's a soft texture I was expecting it to be chewy it's not it's it's quite soft I'm just love it around in my mouth dissolve slowly like I said now in the background you can definitely taste the sort of weed not weed the RV hemp Etape that makes sense well it's definitely disguised well not over empowering with the berries now that was quite palatable it wasn't horrible it wasn't like the oils you had like if you've ever had under sunt inches that's the flavor in the background but it is masked very well it's nothing we'll take it is masked very well by the berries now it's a better this product I would have liked to have seen him sour that's just personally I love sound sweet sour melons but I can see when the Sun totally enjoys that in the morning it's not terrible at all so what much else to say really go check

and why that led me to CBD so please check into that I'm going to go as deep as I possibly can with it and then hopefully it's going to be uncomfortable I know it's gonna be uncomfortable for me but

back to my channel unless you're new here hello I'm Madi I usually do weight loss videos fitness videos PCOS videos all the health-related stuff today is going to be something extremely different from anything I've ever films and anything I've ever tried like you saw in the title I tested out CVD for sleep for body paint I work out five times a week so I really wanted to try it for that for all the claim to benefits of CVD I wanted to know the truth and no this video isn't sponsored but I did get some products sent to me and those are the products I'm going to be talking about today I have no obligation to give you guys a good review or anything so I'm gonna tell you the truth with my little experiments that I did real quick before we talk any deeper about CBD a disclaimer I will have a full disclaimer in the description box if you're interested in trying CBD make sure you talk to your doctor first all the the full thing is down below alright so before we talk about the experiments I did testing out CBD for all the benefits I really want to go over what CBD is if you already know what CBD is just skip to this number right here on the screen and that will take you to the experiment side of the video but if you're interested in what CBD is I'm just going to do a quick little rundown of it first and most importantly CBD is non psychoactive it will not get you high it will not make you eat all the food it doesn't it doesn't have any of the effects that THC does so CBD non psychoactive know this stop asking me this grandma if you're watching no I'm not getting high other benefits is its anti-inflammatory which is amazing it really helps with muscle pain its antibacterial which what that's so cool and it's extremely moisturizing it's so moisturizing it contains 21 of the amino acids in a mega three an omega-6 which is like your skin feels so good after I will tell you all about that when we get to the experiment part of this video a couple other things it really helps with skin condition so if you have eczema psoriasis the hard work from you say psoriasis oh my gosh and it helps treat cold sores I have a lot of sources link to down below so if you're interested more information about CVD just go down there I just wanted to cover like the baseline because I'm just doing like kind of like a baseline experiment anyways let's get into all the products I use for this experiment first so here's a few of the products that I tested out all of these products that I'll be talking about today is from CBD you me.com they were nice enough to send these products over my way first up we have tea lotion and this is the recovery extreme-sports cream it has 400 milligrams of CBD it's an 8 ounce container and this off the bat when I first tried this out it smells really really good like tea tree and lots of different like essential oils my boyfriend actually thinks that kind of smells like pickles I don't get pickles off of it I really enjoy the scent of this next up is a bath bomb I'll put the picture right over here on the screen because I already use the bath bomb on the website it says it's 800 milligrams but down below in the description it says it's 250 milligrams and lastly we have all of these gummies that I try it out we have gummy party pack which is a thousand milligrams a waterbomb oh these ones were so good like watermelon candies everything this was 250 milligrams and then lastly we have gummy bears which was 250 milligrams as well little side note here I am going to be doing a giveaway from one of the bath bombs over my Instagram I will give more information at the end of this video so stay tuned for that let's get into the experiments I'm so excited the first one I tried out is the body lotion and oh my gosh I tried this only on the left side of my body for a whole entire week and it was weird like right away I felt like a warm almost like tingly sensation trained really hard I work out five times a week I do boot camps I do a lot of squats I do a lot of weightlifting I work out very very hard my body is constantly sore so I really wanted to see if this work just on half of my body and I really noticed a difference I laid down and like noticed like a relief like a side like like my body is relaxed like no it's not magic does it take away all the pain but I definitely felt like my muscles more relaxed which was amazing so I've been trying this out for a week only on the left side of my body and I actually have boot camp tonight and it is heavy weights with cardio tonight and I can't wait to rub this all over my body because this video is not done the next thing I tried out was the bath bomb I'll insert another picture over here for you the bath bomb I I was so skeptical about a bath bomb like working because I take baths a lot I love lush I love using bath bombs I love relaxing in the bathtub I did really didn't think that it would help with my muscles I just was like okay cool I'll try it out it's a bath bomb but oh my goodness it was the most relaxed I have ever felt like I just felt like I was like melting away like it really does like just melt away stress and then also like all my body aches I felt like jello after like yeah I feel relaxed after bath anyways but like I felt like extra relaxed it was such a great great feeling and that's why I'm gonna be giving one away like I said earlier but stay tuned for more information at the end of this video last but not least we have all of our gummies so this was a lot of gummies to eat I tried them out for sleep problems I tried them out for anxiety I tried them in the morning in the night I tried them at all different times to really see what you know worked best for me and I gotta say the watermelon was my favorite all of them were really really great watermelon was my favorite because of the taste and then also the first day when I try these out I tried them around noon and I noticed like my mind was a lot more clear like I was a lot more like chill I mean obviously I was still myself because this is non psychoactive like it's not gonna change how my brain is I mean but it kind of does because I was more relaxed anyways you guys get it I was just definitely a more calm and chilled like with anxiety I have racing thoughts all the time I overthink a lot but when I tried this out in the middle of the day I really noticed myself just like be more chill and I really liked that another day when I tried it out I tried it around like four o'clock before I went to the gym I didn't really notice anything different I do have gym anxiety which I've talked about before where like I don't like to work out in front of people in same ways like I don't really like to film around other people and I just notice myself just get through my workout and go home and do some body lotion on the half of my body the thing that really impressed me with this is when I tried them right before bed so the last five nights of trying these out I have been eating a couple of these at night right before bed and I have had the best sleep like I can't believe this helped my sleep so much some of you guys may not know I do have a lot of sleep issues like I you know I have insomnia and I lay in bed until 3:00 in the morning 4:00 in the morning sometimes I see the Sun come up I just have really bad sleep issues and with that no it didn't like the song coming out like I did it like make me like a zombie and pass out or anything but it definitely like I said earlier commish my mind and I was able to relax but the weirdest thing is I got really really vivid dreams when I took CBD before bed and I don't know if this is like an owned known fact or something it was CBD but like my dreams were insane and I mean I'm not complaining I love dreams I love looking at what dreams mean and stuff but that's just something I noticed with it but I did notice also when I woke up I felt so refreshed like I felt like I actually got like a full night's sleep and I felt I did get some deep sleep I'm not sure if this is what you think or what but I'm gonna say this is the only thing I've changed recently is this I used to take tons of sleeping medicine I used to rely on slinky medicine and I always feel so gross in the morning but I'm just so happy that like this made my mind clear enough to like get some really good deep sleep overall CBD has cleared my mind help with muscle pain has made me more relaxed and it's natural so I absolutely love CBD I love that I'm not getting like high off of it with my anxiety I don't like to be high I don't get high anymore I don't do that anymore just because I like to keep a calm clear mind and CBD has helped me so much with that I'm so happy to let you guys know I do have an

black uh I wanted to show off my dope shirt I'll show that later but anyway today we're going to review something that people have been asking me to review they've been asking questions about and what it is is CBD gummies I have some CBD gummies here and they are from tsunami these are from tsunami they are 1000 milligrams CBD gum is watermelon range then we that should get a good look at those 1000 milligram CBD gummies these aren't the wonderment of ranks like I just said and they aren't amazing I wanted to I've actually had this for about a week I want to live with the product for a while and try it and also give it to someone else to try and I wanted to see what the effects will be not just pop one in front of the camera because gummies take a while to kick in but these are they're 100% pure CBD gummies they are made from isolated I'm gonna read what it says on the label here it says grown extracted and refined within the United States I'll tsunami CBD products adhere to only the highest possible production standards during extraction we remove all other elements of the plan including TAC terpenes trichomes and other chemical compounds our CBD isolate then undergoes a unique refining process resulting in the purest form of CBB available each batch we produce is independent independently lab tested and the results are available to view by scanning the QR code on the label and this is the QR code it's gonna be right there on your dummy's now as far as how to use these these are fifty gummies that's in this package right here and it says they are 20 milligrams of CBD per dummy consume no more than two pieces every six hours because if you don't it may induce drowsiness you gonna be tired yeah it's gonna be falling asleep if you are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors ma oh I medication stimulates nice to steroidal anti-inflammatory medication under the influence of alcohol if you are pregnant breastfeeding or operating heavy machinery do not take more than two of these in fact I would suggest you only take one because you are going to be sleeping and if you're pregnant of course anytime you're taking anything while pregnant make sure you consult with your physician your doctor or your Midwife monitoring your pregnancy alone with you make sure you check with them first so let's get to it let me show you the dumbest no I am a huge fan of these this is what they look like who in the smell that watermelon smell is so good and the guys are tsunami they've reached out to me and they let me know that their CBD gummies they are infused never sprayed I didn't even know that was a thing that sometimes some companies excuse me some companies instead of infusing their blemish they just take the dummies and they spray them with CBD it's been in the wake of [ __ ] I've ever heard of in my life my mind was blown mind blown but these gummies these gummies are yummy I have a friend that drives uber and lyft and they suffer from back problems because they were in a crash a few months back and the back really aches them it hurts them a lot so I bet them I make a mistake I'm saying mistake cause my gummies is going down but anyway I made the mistake of letting them try some of these gummies and it's not really a mistake I'm just kidding I let them try some of the gummies and after a long night of driving uber and lyft the next thing that gets me a car and was like dude I'm gonna need those yummies what can I get those gummies so I told them to go to tsunami to get them some gummies and that was like well in the meantime in between time let me pull up on you and get some of them gummies so they pulled up on me got a little sandwich bag and put them like five or six gummies in there I mean they were like it really really eased their back pain there able to make it through the night of driving and you know when you're sitting in a car you're uncomfortable that's applying pressure on your lower back it's pressing down your spine is compressing so you drive an uber and lift in the car all night and these dummies were really able to help them I love them they do take about I'll say about I'm gonna say about 20 to 25 minutes is when they started to kick in for me and you can really start to feel the effects you you feel the coaming you feel the calming relaxation feel that comes over you which is a natural and a well-known feeling for me with any CBD products but then you'll start to feel the pain release the pain relief the pain is it it's like you can't really pinpoint the time that the the pain just goes away but all of a sudden you realize that hmm I was in pain and I'm not really hurting anymore it just it's a really soothing thing I love them and the other thing that I look I love the taste they taste good um these are some of like I wish hi I'm not gonna say I wish because they're good I was I was about to say I wish they weren't CBD infused because I would just be eating these gummies like candy all the time but you're not supposed to take to more than two within a six-hour period but I definitely can just eat these like a snack if you know if I was in the mood if I but they're gonna put me to sleep but I love these these are the 1000 milligrams if I'm not mistaken if I'm not mistaken I think this is the middle ground for me I think they come in 500 milligrams this is the thousand milligrams and I also believe they come in the 1500 milligrams so the thousand works for me this is this is this is where I need it to be at 20 milligrams perfect I mean this is what gives me that relaxation feel excuse me and this is what columns the pain in my back for me I'm gonna show you this again but also it is time it's Black History Month let me show you this is dope I'm having a dope short day let me that you get me that you see this shirt we are the grandchildren of the slaves you couldn't kill we are the grandchildren of the slaves you couldn't kill it but anyway up so yeah I wanted to do that let me show you these again like I said I got these from tsunami so you'll be able to go there if you want some that's all you need to know right there tsunami I like it a lot oh let me give me that let me give me a screenshot here that's what you - I don't I never know what they're gonna use as my thumbnail hopefully they'll use this maybe but even right so if you look and put some good dummies I suggest these right here I suggest these tsunami isolate dummies there I mean I don't know what else to tell you is this stuff I like them a lot I think they come in peach as well I'll have to try those patrons I'm kind of cleaning about my peach baby they beat you better be on point but this watermelon is good but would you expect anything else from someone of my complexion then to thank watermelon let's do it no it's amazing it's true I love it as we'd like to say here on smoking legal keep your positive oh well keep it pushing oh thank you guys for tuning in up for my

everything and you can even get copies of the COS which I will mention in this review these Charlotte's Web gummies are actually brand new to these Charlotte's Web lineup I just started hearing about him this summer the summer of 2019 so I was really excited to get these gummies just to try them there are actually three different ones you can try the recovery then they have one for sleep and then they have one that is just for calm so I was really pumped to try these recovery one since I am in the yoga industry and I am always looking for something that will help me to recover a little bit faster so I can get back to my daily routines with a little more ease right so each gummy has five milligrams in it the suggested serving size is actually two gummies so you'll get 10 milligrams of CBD each time you take a serving of this and guess what this is a full spectrum product so that means Charlotte's web uses the entire planet everything that basically grows above the ground is considered or they aerial part of the plant and that means that you get the full benefit of all of the hemp plant which is sometimes called the entourage effect so you get the cannabinoids and the terpenes and all the other wonderful things that are inside that hemp plant each time you take one of these servings which is two gummies Charlotte's Web is an American CBD powerhouse they've got everything from teen shares that are full spectrum and I they now have these gummies they have pet products and they also have capsules that you can take we have actually done several reviews right here on Green Valley nations so if you'd like to learn more definitely go and make sure to check us out at Green Valley nation.com let's take just a few moments to talk about exactly what you get inside the Charlotte's Web Recovery gummies right now you can only get it in this big container there are 60 gummies they actually don't look like teddy bears this is kind of new to me they're little orange squares also close in on it and you get 60 of those keeping in mind that one suggest a serving size is two of these gummies you do get 10 milligrams of a full spectrum CBD inside each serving size as well as 50 milligrams of tumeric and 25 milligrams of ginger now since this is a Charlotte's Web product you can get this all over US Canada you can get it in Brazil and some places in the UK but that is definitely depending on how much their inventory they have at the time you can have access to their cos there is a QR code right here on the back of the container and as well if you order it online and get the shipping label they'll put a QR code in a place for you to check out the COA there now you what you'll have to do is you'll scan that with your phone and that'll take you to another website in that website you actually on the bottom of this container and a really light green letter and number combination you'll have to read out the lot number and you you put in everything after the pound sign the number sign and that will get you to the certificate of analysis for these gummies now to take just a moment to talk to you a little bit about the certificate of analysis Charlotte's Web completely revamped how they disclosed information this year actually in 2019 so now when you go to that certificate of analysis you get to see the cannabinoid profile in thing that I thought was really cool was the fact that these companies have both CVG and CBC as well as the CBD so this means that it doesn't just have the cannabinoid CBD in it you've got some of the CBC and CBG which each have their own properties to help blend towards wellness in the COA you also can see that the these gummies passed for tests with pesticides residual solvents and microbial meaning that it didn't show positive for any of them which just helps you to know that what you're getting is a really high-quality product that isn't shot up with a whole bunch of crappy chemicals so it makes you just know that this is what it says it is and it's good for you you know like there's nothing really really terrible inside of it so that makes me like it a little bit more let's dive into what it's actually like to supplement with these guys so when you first get your container it's actually you'll notice this is actually a pretty big container this is really a lot bigger than other gummies that I've had of similar counts like 60 counts and the other thing you're going to notice is that they are orange it looks sort of like a cube of sweet potato now because this is a more natural product you're going to notice that it's not covered in anything sugary sweet I'm gonna set this down and it also can kind of feel and look hmm a little slimy I'm not sure if that's gonna be picked up in the camera so you do have to kind of get over the fact that it looks a little weird and it feels weird however it actually tastes pretty good it's a tumeric and ginger flavored candy ish gummy right as CBD gummy and it actually tastes pretty good you just coming up to get over the fact that it looks funny and it feels funny the first time I took them I actually took them after I cut I'm gonna call it a yoga bender I had practiced a whole bunch over two days and I went ahead and took the full dose the two gummies and within about an hour I was already starting to feel some relief from some of the muscle fatigue but more importantly the next day I was not nearly as sore as I thought it'd be like in fact I don't remember waking up and hurting at all which is amazing considering how much practice I'd actually done you will notice that compared to other gummies like if you use still some of your kids gummies these don't have the same texture they're gonna they're don't stick to your teeth as much which I actually appreciate and they're not quite as sweet but they actually still taste pretty good you can take one if you don't if you only want the five milligrams but the recommended dose is definitely two I'm gonna take one just right now because I'm not really hurting and I kind of like the way they taste now let's talk a little bit about what it's like to incorporate these Charlotte's Web Recovery gummies into your day-to-day life over time so every time I have taken these gummies it has been expressly to see how I would feel after a particularly hard day workout etc so I can take them in the morning and I have taken them at night and in the middle of the day the things that I've noticed every single time I've taken them is that the residual pain that I almost always have like in my low back and hip and you know feet cuz I'm 40 going on 85 apparently it always goes away it takes usually about half an hour to an hour and that pain goes away I don't use these to help me sleep but I do notice that if I take it at night before bed it will help me I seem to sleep through the night as compared to waking up between that dreaded you know like 1:30 and 3:30 and can't go back to sleep when I do take the gummies before bed I do tend to stay asleep the whole time I really love the fact that these help to get rid of the pain and make me a little bit nicer so if I take it when I'm just kind of wound up and stressed out they every single time I've taken them they kind of just they don't make me kind of they don't make me sleepy you're kind of they just make me feel good and so that's one of the best things that I love about these Charlotte's Web CBD recovery gummies let me give you a couple of other things that I really like about the gummies another thing especially if you're one of those that really pays attention to how much sugar you take you're gonna notice there's not that much sugar in here in fact there is only 3 grams of added sugars which if you're really trying to watch that sugar intake that's that's actually pretty good for a gummy I think another thing I like is how secure this is so it does take up some real estate like there's a lot of space here so it's not like you're gonna put this in your back pocket and it's kind of a hassle to throw in your purse but guess what like this isn't gonna fall apart the nice screw-on container and in fact it actually took me a little bit to get it open so it's a very secure container that will hopefully help keep these guys fresh a little bit longer it's just not the most convenient carrying size because these are slightly larger now let's talk about a few things that I don't really love about the Charlotte's Web recovery gummies so first one it's really just a tactile thing and it's because they kind of feel a little bit like my children have been playing and slime and then left it out and so maybe it's because I have little kids and the the idea of slime going into my mouth kind of bothers me but I do have that mental hurdle once I'm eating it it actually tastes pretty good so it does taste good but it is definitely a more natural I'm gonna use air quotes their product because it doesn't it's not it kind of slimy another thing that I want you to keep in mind that I don't really love it does have 50 milligrams of tumeric and 25 milligrams of ginger however according to like if you do a really quick google search on recommended dosage in for tumeric and ginger for the recovery or anti-inflammatory like these are legitimately like 1/10 of the amount of the suggested dose to have those anti-inflammatory properties so I kind of feel like they're claiming that this can do a lot more than it really can because if you're only giving 50 milligrams marek and you're supposed to get like 500 that's not really enough to do what they're trying to say it does however you are getting 10 milligrams of CBD and at least for me that's perfect for me to quit pain management and stress management and sleep so keep in mind the fact that it's not really that much to mary or ginger I want to talk to you a little bit about the total value that you get when you purchase these Charlotte's Web gummies so cost per serving is about $2 which it's just under $2 which is a little bit high per CBD like total milligrams however if you are one of those people that are very averse to the more earthy flavors that are commonly found in linked tinctures then this is it's worth it to spend a little bit more money to get a product that is all-natural full-spectrum and it actually tastes pretty good so in that regard it is a little bit more expensive but it's worth it if the taste factor is way way way a big deal another thing that is great about those Charlotte's Web products is that they are C GMP certified u.s. hemp certified they come with all of their test results so you know exactly what you're getting and you know you're getting a high premium product so it can't kind of gives you a little bit of security knowing that you're going with a company that's been around for a long time since 2011 they have been offering products on the market they're the largest CBD provider in America so if you are really really tied to not liking the taste of these pictures and you want to go with a company and a brand that is known and trusted across the u.s. this is a really really good option so to summarize all of these little bits and pieces together inside each Charlotte's Web Recovery gummies you get 60 of these sort of sweet potato or Yammy colored but tasty gummies they actually are a little bit more like fruit roll-ups if you will then an axe gummy they have 10 milligrams of CBD 50 milligrams of tumeric and 25 milligrams of ginger this is an organic product it is C GMP certified and US hemp Authority certified you can get it here in the States in Brazil Canada and also in some places in the UK once again my

outside of the Jurassic Park I didn't get called by the police but I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "Swk5IinRHN0": "hey guys Jessie with digital entrepreneur here just making a quick review for one of the other coming products that I tried from just CD I had an original video on the CBD 250 milligram sour gummy worms and I really liked it I made a good review on it that review will be in the description below if you want more of an overview of my first experience and what to look out for when you take these type of gummies but here I'm just making a review for this big pack right here once I tried the small pack and realized I liked it I just went for the big pack because I knew I was just going to continue eating them and I figured I could try a bunch of different gummies that they offer in one big variety pack and just tell you guys what I think about it so I'm just gonna click on here I'll just show you guys that I have it too I showed the website a little bit more in the other video like the home screen and things like that so if you want check out the the website the link will be in the description as well I have a discount code for 25% off for these gummies I am an affiliate for this company I really do like these products and that's why I promoted I use it myself daily so you know just quickly make I'm sorry I had a phone call I'll call them back in a sec here so I'm just gonna make my screen bigger show you guys that I have this myself it is sour bears sour worms and pee chose so I like all of them they all have different dosages so I'll just go back to the website and show you guys what it says here it says that the Bears are 15 milligrams the sour worms are 20 milligrams and the apple rings and like the peach O's things like that are all those are 30 milligrams so um so originally I said the sour worms were 14 milligrams but I guess I got that wrong and you know you know what it is is uh everybody kind of reacts to this differently I gave this to my girlfriend I would feel the worms because I kind of have an expectation of how they're supposed to work right like they they reduce my anxiety a good like good a little bit it's not like this overwhelming like feeling that you get when you take but it does calm you down if you're feeling a little antsy and you need to just to just take the edge off like real quick and it all depends like what you ate that day what your tolerance is to CVD so there's a lot of factors that that go into how it makes you feel and every person just is gonna have to test out how much to take and the first video I talked about how not to not take too much in the beginning because it actually can make you really drowsy and and affect you when you're driving or something like that so I definitely definitely recommend starting slow if you want to try more of it try it when you're when you're home and when you don't have to really do anything really too important or operate any heavy machine machinery or anything like that so just making a review of what I think about the different the different variety gummy worms and gummies in general in this pack so the 15 milligram sour bears are really good I think there's they're just a little like sometimes I'm even antsy in the morning right before I start work at Lee tried to change up my routine in general because once I work from home and I try to dive straight into my work I sometimes just get like all these thoughts of what I'm supposed to do throughout the day and it starts getting a little overwhelming and then I pop one of those even like I try to I haven't had any experience like feeling bad like eating one and before eating breakfast or anything like that so that's a good sign it doesn't upset my stomach or anything like that and it does take a little edge off it it seems to work on me I'm girlfriend Lee tried one piece so I think everybody's gonna have a little bit of a different tolerance um the worms work exactly the same way that they did before for me my tolerance is definitely getting going up a little bit sometimes like to feel like as much of a calming effect so I did notice that sometimes I can eat a worm and then I can also eat a bear and but usually I tend not to do that stuff as I know if I have to go somewhere or something like that um so usually like what I'll do is if I want to have a little bit more of an like edge now I'll actually eat one PTO's because it's 30 milligrams and it's instead of taking like 20 milligrams here from one of the worms and 15 milligrams from the bear I'll usually just pop on the PTO's and that has been kind of like the go-to piece for me when I'm trying to go towards like feeling a little bit stronger effects but not not overwhelming right so it's not bad like I can still drive on it but I definitely hits me with the the pecos or the watermelon rings whatever you want to call them so yeah that's pretty much it if I want to go to sleep I think that the pea chose even though there are 30 milligrams they're still not strong enough for me to really make me feel like I'm it's gonna make me like super tired or anything really like that but it definitely helps with anxiety and calming down so usually I'll do a combination of like a worm and a bear or a peach oh and a bear that will make me go to sleep there's not like a lot of worms in here so I've been eating the less of the worms so yeah it's two worms would be 40 milligrams and yeah that could work too honestly like though the the watermelon rings or just any of the rings I'm like like confusing what they call these things now but that and a bear has been knocking me out real nice and I feel refreshed in the morning and yeah that's pretty much my review I basically take them pretty much the same way that I did before sometimes if I'm not feeling it as strong as I used to when I first started I'll just either eat a peach o instead of a worm and that usually does the trick for me umm haven't seen like a huge tolerance shift but definitely a little bit of a increase in my colouring so that's it for this review umm I really like this variety pack because it gives you a lot of different options and if it's a really good bang for your buck compared to the small amount they that I first purchased and as you can see I've been a I put a nice bend in it already so yeah that's it for this video I hope you guys like this review of the variety pack and I'll have the links in the description for the coupon code if you want to check this out and I'll see you guys in the next video", "5XZqMXD7v0w": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is lauren if you're new here and i do tons of reviews on all kinds of things today i am sharing with you one of my favorite brands of cbd products and that is joy organics so as you can see here i have the cbd oil and i have the cbd soft gels which is just like a capsule and i have the cbd gummies so these are like my go-to cbd products any brand that i use that i like i'd say i almost always get these three products to use because it's just what i personally utilize the most when i am using cbd oil or cbd products which is pretty much every single day and i wanted to share this company with you specifically because it is one of my favorites um joy organics is a company that offers cbd products more specifically broad spectrum cbd products so they are thc free you don't get high from cbd products especially and definitely broad spectrum because they do not contain any thc they go through so many third-party tests to ensure their quality their potency and that they are again a true broad spectrum product so i am going to show you these three things uh starting with the gummies because these are some of my favorite i've tried a lot of cbd products and these gummies that joy organics makes if not the best like one of my top two or three cbd gummies they are so good i have the strawberry lemonade flavor and i'm gonna show you guys what they look like there is sometimes cbd gummies will have like a weird kind of like a weird smell to them when you open them up these do not at all as you can see i've eaten quite a few of them i have to get more um but they smell just kind of like a candy and they look like this each one of these cbd gummies contains 10 milligrams of cbd per gummy i personally find that around two gummies helps me with them having like if i notice i'm a little stressed more than normal throughout the day i'll take a cbd gummy i always use a cbd product before bed about a half hour before bed because cbd for me helps me get to sleep so much faster than i normally do on my own i have always i think in my adult life had trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep i've always been a really light sleeper and my mind just races i think a lot of us women our mind races at night and i used to lay in the bed like literally for hours sometimes before i could fall asleep and cbd like literally when i take cbd which has been for like years now i'd say i'm not in bed any more than like a half hour before i'm asleep which is great for me because it used to be hours at a time and my husband hits the pillow and he's like out which is so annoying but now that i use my cbd it's way less annoying because i can get to sleep way quicker and it helps me not wake up throughout the night as often so i really like you utilizing cbd to help me sleep it's also really great for anyone who suffers from like chronic pain or inflammation um anxieties stresses anything like that i love cbd if i have a really like i did a really hard workout and i have just a little more sore muscles than normal i'll use the cbd either the capsules or the cbd oil um capsules i usually find myself taking if say i have a headache or you know my lower back is bothering me or something like that kind of in a situation where years and years and years and years ago i would take like an ibuprofen or an advil for which i don't take anymore i use the cbd capsules for things like that that really help me and again they're also really great at helping with stress anxiety things like that so the capsules are just like this so the capsules have 25 milligrams each um in each serving which i think is one yes so 25 milligrams of cbd oil in one capsule so a little bit more potent than one cbd gummy um and the capsules look like so so they're super small which is good and they're really easy to take for me i've never really had an issue some people do but that's why i like that they offer the gummies as well and then the oil which this flavor by the way the peppermint i think it's just well they call it tranquil mint but it's made with peppermint oil organic peppermint oil um which is another thing why i love joy organics the quality of their ingredients is so top-notch um this flavor is so so good i was a little worried because like when i think like mint i'm like oh i don't want to be like too overwhelming but the tranquil mint cbd oil from them is actually not overwhelming at all it's really nice it's not too too minty or pepperminty and you just fill up one dropper full i'm shaky because i just drank my coffee but and there's 45 milligrams so again another like little bump up of potency from the other two products there's the 45 milligrams of cbd in one dropper full so that is like a serving these are nice because you can kind of like control like say you just wanted half of that right you want 22 ish milligrams of cbd you could just take a half a dropper and i drop it under my tongue and i leave it there i let it sit there i don't swallow it or anything for like at least a minute sometimes i try to make it go a little longer and then after the minute i if there's any left like we'll swallow drink a little water and that's how i use the cbd oil they also make cbd um rubs so like salves and things that you can use on your skin if you suffer from like certain areas that like for example my dad has a bad shoulder so he'll use cbd the cbd balm on his shoulder and it really really helps him with his relief so like bad knees things like that um anyone i think could benefit from a cbd product again joy organics is a broad spectrum cbd so there is no thc you don't have to worry about like failing a drug test or anything like that there's absolutely no thc in their products and they again do testing to ensure that but they also include like on each and every one of their products that it is thc free so i don't when i take a cbd if you haven't taken cbd before i don't feel like my state of mind is altered at all i honestly just feel like relaxed if that makes sense like it's not like something that i can like feel it's kind of something that's like an afterthought if that makes sense um so it doesn't like make you feel like altered or like your mind is altered or any way there's it's obviously like the non like they don't have like the psychotic like effects that thc does because that is a part of hemp that causes that which is not included in cbd if it was i wouldn't take it um so the broad spectrum products from joy organics is great they are a family um founded company and i really love their story if you have a chance go ahead on their website and check out their story and what else do i want to tell you guys about oh so they grow their own cbd plants here in the usa which i think is really important when i look for a cbd product all of their products are grown and made in colorado which is awesome their quality is great and oh so i also wanted to mention jewelry organics because i know a lot of people have questions about cbd products and like what's right for them or what is cbd they have so many great resources on their website that really help the consumer to like know okay what is it exactly that i'm buying what is it that i need do i need this so they have really great resources but i also wrote

supplement style thing we got going on here this obviously per the title is what it is and I'm sure somebody that watches this channel is going to be opposed to it just because usually you know the gun guys and gals and stuff like that and you know patriotic Americans conservatives Republicans whoever you are out there or against the weed in the disc that no thing this isn't weed this has no weed in it has no THC in it but it is CBD oil okay and it's koi brand five hundred milligram there is a bunch a bunch a bunch of reasons to take this stuff a couple years back I hurt my back pretty bad at work I was out of work for you know seven eight nine months and I still feel pain every day for the most part some days it's better some days it's worse you know it all depends and sometimes it keeps me up at night and I can't sleep because of it I can't get comfortable and it just sucks it really just sucks and I've been researching you know CBD and stuff like that for a while now and you know I came across koi you guys know I do the vape thing you know so I'm in and out of vape shops a lot and they've been carrying all this stuff as of late at least the one that I go to and they've got a wide variety of brands and different types of ingestion for your CBD you know they've got oils like this which this is like a tincture little dropper for one you're supposed to shake it up but you shake it up real good and then you take a dropper put it under your tongue hold it under there for like ten seconds and then swallow it this is the pink lemonade flavor from koi it tastes like cough syrup really but it's not that bad it's bad it's just one swallow and giggity and you could also vape this too I feel like it's definitely more efficient to do the tincture it absorbs quicker you're not wasting juice well you guys could do whatever you want here's a look zero THC made-in-america gotta love that here's the ingredients you know and so CBD itself you guys do your own research you know don't believe me do your own research especially if you're opposed to it but look into it because there's a lot of benefits to using CBD and it's totally legal it's a hundred percent legal in all 50 states there's no drugs in it there's no THC there's no nuttin you don't get high when you take it you know there's no euphoric feeling there's nothing but there's a lot of added health benefits to it it helps with inflammation it can help with pain it helps you sleep better at night there's it helps with anxiety and stress and depression and all types of different things if you're if you don't have an appetite it helps you gain an appetite you know if you're sick you have cancer stuff like that that's the other thing too is it may help you know with cancer or cancer like symptoms different things like that there's a wide variety of different studies on CBD and all the benefits that it has and there's a lot of people that take it anywhere from young to old I assume you got to be 18 at least to buy this I don't know if it says or not but it's definitely gaining in popularity and it's definitely helped a lot of people to the point where there's even been like major news stories on CBD and the people that take it you do have to be careful because some brands there's like a legal amount of THC that is allowed to be in the CBD and still be legal I think it's like point zero three percent or 0.1 three percent or something like that along those lines and if you do take enough of it and on a regular basis there is a possibility that you could fail a drug test even though you're not getting high you're not smoking weed you're not doing the pots you know so that is something to be concerned about but from all the research that I've done koi does have zero like completely zero THC in it and you will not fail test using this I don't know I've only been taking it for about a week maybe a little bit more than a week everyday couple tinctures of it a day you know one when I wake up maybe one in the middle of the day one before I go to sleep and so after this bottle is done I'm gonna go to Walgreens or wherever and get one of those at home drug tests for weed and I'm gonna piss in it and I'm going to see if the tests positive and if it does then I'll probably stop taking it unfortunately even though I've already felt benefits from it but I'm not going to risk you know a job or my rights or any of that stuff for this the main reason I've been looking into it and trying to take it is because the regular medicine you know advil Aleve vicodin whatever it is like the actual medicine the pills you know you go to Walgreens or your doctor gives it to you it might help but it's not natural and you can get addicted to that stuff and it's it all the side effects are usually worse than just dealing with the pain from you know whatever it may be your injury or or whatever it is so this is natural you know it's you don't have you can get it any time you want you don't have to wait for a prescription you know you could buy as much as you want different dosages like I said before this is a 500 milligram there's thousand milligram and I believe even 2500 milligram obviously the higher the dose the stronger it'll be the more effective it will be there's also ones lower than this but for me I have noticed an improvement I felt less pain my back hasn't been bothering me as much you know any type of stress related to work or just life in general seems to be not affecting me as much and then on top of it the best part of this is I'm getting better sleep you know I usually you know I'll get home from work later at night whatever it is and you know I've been at work all day so I want to I want to do something or I got work to do doing YouTube videos or whatever and you know sometimes I don't go to bed till 11:00 12:00 1:00 in the morning sometimes and but with this you know I I go right to sleep and I sleep soundly and I wake up and I feel refreshed where normally before I started taking this you know I'd be I'd be tossing and turning I couldn't follow this fall asleep and then when I did sleep I'd be waking up it felt like you know every hour on the hour trying to get comfortable again you know on the back was hurt and the neck was hurting whatever it is that all while taking this for the past week 10 days whatever it's been I've definitely noticed an improvement I've felt better I've slept better and that means a lot that means a lot because you sleep at night you wake up for the next day you got to go to work you got to do this you got to do that you're going to the gym you're hanging out with friends or going hiking going to the range you want to be the best that you can be you want to be as well-rested as you can be and this has definitely helped that's one of the things I can say it has definitely helped me rejuvenate during sleep and feel better and wake up refreshed and like I said you know calming down the stress not that I'm like totally stressed out and tweaking out man but everybody's got stress in life and this kind of you know I felt like it hasn't affected me as much without taking it I don't know if it's a placebo it's just in my head whatever maybe but I think it works I think it works and there's really no negative consequences to this whatsoever as far as health-wise there's only health benefits from all the research that I've done the only downside is that you might possibly fail a drug test but if you don't have to worry about that or if you know it's accepted by your employer or whoever you know they know you're taking it and you know it's legal there's nothing wrong with it plus there's a lot of companies that are even changing their policies and their drug testing to allow for this because this stuff is gaining in popularity you know not just koi in general but CBD and it really has there's a lot of stories out there if it really helping people and it's helping me so Pharr so like i said guys if you're into it if you're interested check it out do your own research don't believe anything I tell you and I will come back with an update in a week or two a couple weeks whenever this bottle is done it's a 30ml bottle so you know whenever I got a little bit left in there but uh I'll come back I'm not gonna do the drug test on camera obviously but I'll let you guys know the results and hopefully it stands true to what it says absolutely zero percent THC and I would pass the drug test and then that way there I would have no qualms or issues with taking this continually whatsoever and that's the thing too if you're going to buy this stuff you have to realize that it's not gonna work overnight you're supposed to take it for a little while get it into your system and then you will see the you know the the benefits and the effects of it a little bit down the road so that's something to throw out there it's something new for the channel something different and I wanted to share that with you because I know that when my back is hurting me it's killing me I know that if I don't get good sleep you know I wake up and I don't want to do this I don't want to do that you know I feel like crap you know then you're in pain you're you know you're upset you're frustrated if this can help with something just as simple as that let alone all the other better stuff that it can do why not you know so that's the video guys thank you so much for watching please leave any comments in the comment section below if you've got any experience with

helps me out like share comment subscribe all that good stuff anyway I'm done the videos longer than it should have been thank you guys for watching stay tuned for what's next we'll catch you on the next one", "G4F1Dd5UwNI": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I have a new video for you guys and in today's video I'm going to be sharing five top CBD brands that I've tried and I'm super excited because if you guys follow me on Instagram and on here I've mentioned CBD plenty of times so I'm ready to get into this and I'm ready to share the girls with you guys so if you guys want to know what those are then please stay tuned and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel and follow me on Instagram snapchat Facebook and Twitter and let's get right into the video I'm really excited about this video because CBD is like life CBD helps me when I can't sleep CBD helps me when I am super anxious if I'm going to be in a space where I feel really like tense and stuff it definitely helps me sometimes I get oh for plane right they are everything I eat them like just regular candy on plane rides and by the way for this video I'm only going to be talking about gummies so I'm gonna be talking about the ones that you can eat kind of like candy because they essentially are candy if you guys want me to do a separate video on all kinds of CBD products for example like the oils and stuff like that or even like the droppers cuz I use that as well and I've tried that those as well but the gummies are actually like my favorite kind of CBD products cuz it just tastes good it tastes like you're eating candy and then it just does magic so let's just get right into it because enough talking so the first company I'm gonna talk about is a Verma Farms I shared them with you guys on Instagram but you guys I got these not too long ago it's probably almost been a month if not shorter then that but these are so good I'm definitely gonna be eating them as I do this video eat them I really don't eat a lot but anyways I'm gonna share with you they actually sent me three flavors three different flavors so they sent me the blueberry way that CBD gummies and it looks like this so I'm gonna in that and if you guys ever these remind me of my childhood so much because I used to love getting from the grocery store like the peach rings I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about but once you see them maybe you'll know what I'm talking about or not if you never had them so this is what it looks like oh so good so good and I'm dumping gonna eat this right now it's so good don't let this video for you I do not eat these just for fun I'm just eating it because I'm gonna film a Y chat Wednesday for you guys like right after this so I not get all in the mood you know as this says it does taste like blueberry it has like a blueberry taste you kind of taste a little bit of bitterness because it is CBD so and essentially CBD does have like that very kind of taste but for the most part it's just my candy like honestly you can just give this to somebody don't don't do that you should know but honestly if you just give this to me and just tell me that it's regular candy I probably believe you just all of these have it basically the same thing in the front of them the same description it just says natural kind of Biddle tendon kind of bit I'm not saying that right but it has 500 milligrams of CBD THC free and it's made in the USA if you guys don't know what CBD is which maybe I should have started with that so for those of you that don't know CBD is short for I can't pronounce that it's short for this word right here I'm not even gonna try to pronounce that and it is a trending ingredient the natural products industry and it's the focus of a new area of cannabis research CBD is one of many cannabinoids or molecules produced uniquely cannabis family what CBD does is just basically like relaxes you so if you're in taking them like these dummies then you're gonna automatically just feel very calm and relaxed and it's gonna like calm you down overall I've never experienced feeling like woozy or like high or anything like that from taking CBD that's not what CBD does is the opposite so I really love CBD so anyways [Music] so anyway send me the blueberry ones and now I'm gonna talk to you guys about the melon ones so these are the Maui melon ones and these are also from vamp Verma farms and this is what they look like so essentially it's all the same thing just different colors so this one is like that pinkish color and this one smells the best to me as it smells super duper fruity and it also has a very fruity taste it tastes very very tropical so I really like these as well and by the way Verma forms is kawaii so these are actually produced in Hawaii the last one that I got from Verma Farms is the peach Pau Hana CBD gummies and these ones are exactly like the peach rings so they look like this and these taste so good they smell so good - oh my gosh but as you guys can see these are these look like regular candy these look like candy that you can just get from the store and honestly it tastes just like it so if anything I definitely would say I definitely would recommend for you to be introduced to CBD gummies no CBD through gummies so if you've never tried TVD I definitely say go for the gummies because the oil is just taste they don't have a taste it kind of tastes nasty some of them tried to incorporate like a better taste just like some of them have peppermint and stuff like that which fine but as long as it does the job for me it doesn't really matter but the taste if you guys are new to the CBD type of thing that I'll say just go for the gummies because then it wouldn't throw you off and then make your way over to the oils and stuff so the next one that I'm gonna share with you guys is called on Cali CBD um these are amazing amazing and you can tell these are amazing because I share these with you guys I think like a couple of months ago if I'm not mistaken I can't remember and it's almost done like I love these these are I'm gonna show you so these are basically like gummy bears they look like little gummy bears and I only have four left I need to repurchase but you guys see they're basically gummy bears and they taste just like gummy bears these have all of these gummies kind of have like that bitter taste like it's it's like it's kind of like an aftereffect though it's not like while you're eating it so I recommend that if you're gonna eat any of these companies before bed to drink some water or some juice because in the middle of the night it just tastes like it's just really better like and even when you wake up it's just like really really bitter like you just have like a bitter kind of taste here from home but it doesn't really bother me but if if anything if it's gonna be your first time trying CBD gum paste and that's just my my tip for sure because it's happened to me at plenty of times um this one Oh actually let me tell you guys how many gummies each of these brain ok so unfortunately the Burma farms don't say how many gummies and they have inside but the on Cali CBD gummies have 80 gummies inside and they are 500 milligrams six milligrams per gummy and they're also made in the USA and yeah that's pretty much it so on Kalia actually got my god brother to try these and he and my god mom really really liked them and I take like I can take two of these I think that's the recommendation is that you take two of these for the Burma farms I'll take out eat like maybe two to three but one you already kind of feel like very relaxed like I just ate one at the beginning of this video and I am pretty much chilled so that's that with these I have to make sure like these I can only take at night or if I'm on a plane ride or car ride or something for a long time because these knock me out they take me out I just I can't function after eating these at all if I can't sleep these are my goal too which is why it's almost empty because I use them a lot in the night time if I take two then I'll be asleep in about 20 minutes if I take three I'll be asleep in five to 10 minutes like I'm not it sounds like I'm probably exaggerating but I promise you I'm not exaggerating like it knocks me out and I can appreciate that because sometimes I really can't sleep like for no reason especially during this pandemic and everything that's going on in the world these are just magic so on Callie did their thing so the next one I'm gonna talk about I think you can find these at the store I've seen this brand at the grocery stores at any grocery store but I don't know just like random on the counter type of things and I wanted to try them because I just seen them being sold like randomly so this brand is called just CBD and that's the name of it there and this is these aren't gummy worms this also as all of all the candies that these gummies imitate just like it for the most part honestly I don't taste anything different except for like that's that little bitter taste but these tastes just like gummy worms to me these are also 500 milligrams and this one brings approximately 20 pieces so that's that okay the next one I'm gonna talk about is simply green organics I also shared this company with you guys on Instagram and these are their companies and these are flavored green apple and it's a premium and have extract it's 300 milligrams CBD per jar and 10 milligram CBD print gummy and this one has 30 gummies and this one I'm almost done with as well almost done with and these are little cubes which is super cute these don't taste as like chewy they kind of taste more like kind of like that jellybean type of texture so it's a little bit more like mushy it's not chewy as like the other ones so that's how I can describe these if I'm being completely honest the taste of these is not as great you can taste more of the bitterness in these for whatever reason I don't know but it still does a job so these are simply green organics okay and the last company that I'm gonna share with you guys is from Sunday's scary's and I recently just tried these as well and they have two different kinds that they sent me so though this one is the sunny scary's gummies for children with CBD 20 gummies and the bottle looks like this and these ones are also like ooh these ones are also like gummy bears and again they taste so good so so good and I really like like the aesthetic of this company actually so Sunday's series they also sent me their vegan 8f gummy and I was really excited for these because as you guys know sometimes I tend to eat vegan so I was really really excited to get these and these are sour gummies for children with CBD these also have twenty gummies in here and these look like gumdrops gumdrops I think that's the name of that candy and they look like this let me show you it's like a little I'm pretty sure it's kind of just like the gumdrops type of candy but these also don't have like that chewy consistency these also have kind of like the more mushy which I'm not a fan of but as I said if they just get the job done they get the job done so I really really like these and I really really love that they're vegan so if you're vegan and you're looking for CBD gummies and then I definitely recommend these these also work very very well honestly all of the ones that I mentioned and for the most part CBD gummies are my favorite as I said and they work really really well for me for me they help me calm down and just kind of relax so I really really enjoy them and I definitely recommend it to you guys if you guys have trouble sleeping or if everything that's going on in the world right now is really like freaking you out or making you overthink and stuff then I definitely recommend you try these you have to be 18 years or older to consume and tour by these I'm pretty sure all of these usually say that on the bottle anyways so yeah if you're 18 years or older definitely give CBD gummies a try I know a lot of people don't even know that you can consume you can eat CBD instead of using like the oils and stuff so I definitely recommend them I definitely recommend them all of the links to all of these companies will be in the description box below if you guys do try them please let me know what they do for you how they break for you and if you like them and all of that good stuff if I had to choose ones that really do the job and have really been my favorite I definitely go with on Cali just because they're the ones that actually like help me sleep and help me just see um so I I think um they all pretty much work the same though so let me know if you guys decide to try these and I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you guys want more CBD related reviews and stuff like that then let me know because I've tried I possibly tried like everything in the book possibly whatever you know about CBD and whatever companies you have tried let me know in the comments down below because I'm always down to try a new CBD products I love everything CBD so yeah let me know in the comments down below and thank you guys so much for watching if you guys enjoyed this video then please don't forget to give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel and follow me on Instagram snapchat Facebook and Twitter and I'll see you guys in my next video bye", "Dncnf1mNTpA": "so what exactly is in these cbd products mimit uh and i met up at a lab here in los angeles a few weeks ago because we wanted to find out take a look our teams managed to obtain some vials of cbd being sold by several different companies claiming to have our endorsement we send them to dr pedram sullenpoor to be tested at a lab we want to know exactly what is in this alleged cbd it's time to get to the bottom of this dr salampur how are you how are you thank you very much for coming can i show you around we'll follow you fantastic quite a large operation thank you so this is where the testing is done for thc cbd all of the cannabinoids all of the pesticides there are 66 of them that we test for and all of the heavy metals what's really important to remember is that cbd is regulated by the fda for only one drug epidiolex and that's for two rare childhood seizure disorders for everything else it's the wild wild west so you test these things here that aren't regulated and you're looking for what over here so over here we're looking for heavy metals right cadmium arsenic mercury lead pesticides and those things show up in a lot of the cbd products that come through here unfortunately they do because remember hemp is a bioaccumulator so whatever is in the ground gets sucked up into that plant if there's lead in the ground it's going to get sucked up into the plant and whatever gets sucked up into the plant is going to end up in the final product unless it's intentionally taken out what have you found in general we have found pesticides in general we have found heavy metals we have found mycotoxins aspergillus causes aspergilloma in patients that are immune compromised that can wreak havoc some of the people that are seeking this out are already immune compromised then they're especially vulnerable to the heavy metals the pesticides in particular to the fungus that you just mentioned because it grows like these big moth balls in your lungs takes over your breathing ability it can kill you it can burn its weight in the arteries it means horrible death i had no idea you were finding those kinds of elements as well it's just sloppy they're not bothering because they don't care about the people they're just a checkbook they're a credit card yeah they just want their money they don't care about the consequences and when if a consequence arises they're gone i mean they're like trying to sack fog you can't find them they just poof remember testing for this stuff isn't cheap one of these things costs half a million dollars this is the same kind of equipment that tests baby formula so what you're describing costs money and there's a financial incentive if you don't have to to not do it and then they're using our names to validate it fraudulently it doesn't cost them anything to steal our names they don't have to pay you money to test it appropriately it's cash cash cash which is all they're seeing dollar signs when they're talking to people that ask us for advice well when you skip steps and steal names it's easy it's all profit that's right so was there actually cbd at the level that's supposed to be in these products there often is not as much cbd as they purport to put in there because cbd can be very expensive it can cost close to ten thousand dollars a pound for the cbd so you can imagine there's a pretty significant economic disincentive not to put cbd in the product if you don't have to and no one's going to check could you take us through the actual products that we said absolutely sure so we tested a product that came to us from someone that was purporting to have you be their spokesperson but the test that we did on this failed it failed because it is not safe for human consumption under any circumstance it failed because it was too high in its lead content in lead in lead 15 times higher than safe levels 500 times higher than our level of detection okay 15 times higher than safe so this isn't a close call this is highly toxic highly toxic and very dangerous because lead accumulates and again because nobody takes just one of these pills or one droplet this is stuff that people use continuously it's interesting that one of the products that we brought here that tested positive for lead 15 times above acceptable level is called verified verified like we've checked this but we did verify yeah do you have a story or a question for me click the link in the description and tell me what in the world is going on you", "QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and thanks very much well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from GMA every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA", "_knJDER3PkE": "True or false. CBD is the same as marijuana. [Rachel} That's Correct.\nIt's false, Yes. Cannabis is the genus of a plant it's the category of plant. Under cannabis you have marijuana and hemp plants. Okay? The difference, they look the same by the way they smell the same. Right. But the difference between these two plants is the amount of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol now this is the active ingredient in marijuana that's what is the psychoactive ingredient. But you typically know when you think of marijuana you think that people are getting high that's the psychoactive ingredient. The difference is that if a plant has 0.3% or less by dry weight, it is considered to be hemp plant. Correct. If it has more than 0.3% by dry weight it is considered to be marijuana. So that's, right away, the definition. CBD is a cannabinoid. There are lots of cannabinoids that have a lot of active properties in our body. Our body produces endo-cannabinoids which are naturally occurring. Here on the screen you see two different things. To the left is THC. These have the same number of atoms. The same type of atoms, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But, the reason why we highlighted this structure is different. And this is what makes the big difference between THC which is psychoactive and CBD, which is not psychoactive. When the chemical binds to the receptor that structural difference will make something happen different in the body. Right. So that is the difference between THC and CBD. And CBD. Very important, okay? CBD, if it is taken exclusively solely from the hemp plant, it is legal. It is allowed in all 50 states. However, if the CBD is taken from the marijuana plant or it's partially taken from the marijuana plant it depends on the state. As to whether or not they allow it to be legal. As to whether or not it's legal, right. CBD comes in all types of products. When you go to the store, you're gonna see it in all different ways. And I want to kind of guide you through how to choose what you want. Here are some examples of things that you might find. And there are more than this, by the way. But this is a bath powder. So people put these into their bath they dissolve it into their bath.\nI've actually never seen it in bath powder. But I think that that makes sense.\nYeah. Because people soak to relieve pain and inflammation as well.\n100% Right. So it gets into your skin and it give you that soft tissue relief that you're looking for. Lots of lotions out there. So you go to a lot of these beauty stores and cosmetic stores, they have it in the lotions or some of the pharmacies.\nI use a balm. It's like a very thick.\nRight. Dense balm. That's right, so it's thick sometimes, like a salve or it's like a nice thin lotions so they're all different types depending on what you want to get out of it. There are capsules that you can take. Yup. Then you mentioned earlier for Isabu they're tinctures. You have the little dropper and it tells you how much to take and you put on your tongue, boom that's it. And then, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. A pain rub. So this is a freeze right here. This is not about the CBD, by the way that is a primary ingredient but it's about other components. So, the question is, you need to be able to get the CBD and the pain relief chemical into your skin. Right. So it depends on else the manufacturer puts in there to help it seep into the skin. The first thing, is you want to be very clear that it actually says CBD. CBD.\nPeriod. Because, that's right. CBD, it's gotta say that, number one. Number two. So you want to look to see what it says about THC. THC free.\nThis is THC free, very good. The other thing is, you want to make sure it tells you what type of CBD it is. This is very important, pay attention. So here, it says pure isolate. What that means is that the product is 99.9% CBD. It's as pure as you can get it. So it doesn't have any THC. But there's also something called broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means that not only does it have CBD, it has the other cannabinoids I mentioned before. Right. Other good chemicals for you. It's broad spectrum. And lastly, there's something that's called full spectrum. This is where you have to pay attention. Full spectrum means it actually has THC. Okay? So, when you see isolate, that's pure CBD. When you see broad spectrum it's other cannabinoids but still no THC. When you see full spectrum It includes the THC.\nIt includes the THC. Please look at the ingredient list. Because you want to know actually what's in there. So make sure you do that. And lastly, make sure it tells you how many milligrams are on here. Right?\nAnd that's where you get that huge price discrepancy. Ah, there you go.\nThat's right. There you go. So, if the price looks too good to be true. It is.\nIt is. (laughs)\nIt ain't true. Because CBD cost money and so if you want high quality I'm not saying you have to break the bank on it. And it's buyer beware. Yes.\nLike, you really do have to study up on this. You can't just dive in. Please. And the last thing I want to say. (crowd claps) The last thing I want to say is this. A lot of these products have a QR code on it. And you can take your phone and put it up and look at the certificate of analysis. Make sure that the product has been third party tested. Which means they've sent it out to a third party lab to test to make sure it has what is says it has and doesn't have, which you don't want. That's so true of every supplement and vitamin. (crowd cheers) (crowd claps) (bells chime)", "LzG0f5N5P-8": "[Music] and welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is Tina and so this video is gonna be my review on my favorite CVD products this video is so widely requested that I'm doing it while I'm sick I owe you guys a few different videos but I'm trying to get them done now so I'm sorry for my delay I started posting about using CBD as some of you may have so over the past year I started about a year and a half of half ago of just using strictly CBD products before that I was getting CBD products from a medical office in Manhattan so I was using it mixed with THC which I personally did not enjoy I do not like the kind that has THC in it when I started researching that there's companies that have just CVD products I found the one I'm about to show you which is sugar and cush and what a game-changer I'm obsessed I'm so obsessed that's why I've been posting about it I've been posting about it for a long time and I wanted to share it with you guys because I know a lot of you are into the same things and you're interested in using CBD for a variety of reasons I received countless dm's about what do I do for stress relief what do I do to sleep and things along that things within that nature probably because I've expressed before that I have trouble sleeping I've never said that I have anxiety but I think in 2020 we all have anxiety so we need new ways to calm down and get our sleep in and a lot of us are doing a million different things so I just feel like we all have trouble sleeping now for myself I've had trouble sleeping my whole life it is so frustrating I've went years with insomnia I've always had trouble sleeping if I forget my CBD I will still have trouble sleeping I have to bring it with me when I travel I have to figure out ways to get myself to go to sleep because it doesn't happen naturally for me don't know why I've been like this my whole life so anyway getting into the products I've been kind of sick I'm trying to push through but it is so annoying because you'll be okay but to talk the congestion Oh I've actually been I think you see PT all day just so I can relax and try to sleep through the day and get better and then it prompted me to do my makeup and do this video so I have all my favourite products here and I've already put these on Instagram but I wanted to share it with you and I'll leave the link down below because as a partner or what do they call us as an ambassador I have a code and I've been sharing the code with you for so long but I'll leave it down below and on the screen I believe it's Tina 15 and you get money off from your purchase I use my own code and I'll tell you why because I had what cookies to do this video and to try them because I usually just have the drops and the gummies so I bought the cookies and I wanted to try them on this video what had happened was I ate them before filming the video I ate all of them I'm about to finish the boxes that I finished so that I bought I have about three more boxes I figured I'll have one for the house and I'm going to bring two to my best friend's birthday party which is Saturday and guess what let me just show you so the cookies are made in the u.s. it was that too loud the cookies are made in the US and they have low carbs really low sugar they're vegan there it's all in the Box actually so here's the bag it comes in I'm gonna take a cookie out and show you so they're gluten and dairy free 100% vegan my favorite flavor is only 15 calories per serving a serving is a cookie and what a lifesaver because I've been on my dream body journey so having cookies is not in the make for that having these cookies are because they're only 15 calories so even if you wanted one a day as like your breakfast treat or as your dessert you absolutely can and I sugar and cush thank you so much they're also made in the US and I think these have I'm looking in the mirror and these have 200 milligrams of CBD these have 25 milligrams of CBD in them sorry I'm linked backed up so I could read the box and the calories each cookie only has 2 grams of carbs 1 gram of protein 1 gram of sugar I mean you could read all of the ingredients down here and they're really simple which I appreciate I don't like when something has way too many ingredients that makes me kind of like nervous I don't want to eat it I'm trying to be very organic in my new lifestyle and my favorite there's no THC I don't know about some of you but from me I don't respond well to THC I'm not gonna get into it but I don't respond well some of you do that's great you can use this in combination with whatever other remedies you used to go to sleep and relax but for me I cannot have THC ok the other thing I love is let's just be honest not everyone understands CBD I'm hoping we get to a place and a video like this will be helpful I'm hoping we get to a place where everyone understands how helpful CBD is but there's people who don't understand so to have it in the discreet cookie to take with you on the go to work to travel is so helpful and they taste really really good so they're nice to have out at parties and things like that I'll show you what it looks like cuz this is my favorite favorite snickerdoodle I love I love cinnamon like I really love cinnamon how many do I have left ok I ate a bunch there's eight in a bag and I only have two left it has cinnamon sugar all around the outside it tastes like oh I mean it is a real cookie but it tastes like any other cookie and I am a sweets expert the other flavors are just as good because let me tell you I leave one chocolate chip 50 left the chocolate chip cookie has a few more calories I think each cookie flavor varies but that's just because you have to have chocolate chips in it here's how the chocolate chip cookie looks it is so good it's not too hard it's not like a brick and it's not super soft either and they're in the stealable bags so they stay pretty fresh but they're not gonna last long enough for you to need it to stay fresh for a long time I promise you that I kept the box to show you but you don't actually need the box and here is cookies and cream cookies and cream is so good these have a little bit more calories it's 85 calories per serving 25 milligrams of CBD and same amount of cars for carbs 3 grams of fat and 3 grams of sugar so it's not that much more it's still just it's still enough and there's only two of these left as well I eat tons of cookies so embarrassing like here's not the cookies and cream looks it is so good even if you're just dieting and you use this in combination with the drops or if you want a low carb cookie in the house maybe you're on keto or something these cookies are definitely it I'm definitely ordering more sorry to my friend because I was supposed to bring these to her party guess I'm not doing and also the gummy bears I love the gummy bears but let me just tell you I love gummy bears I used to eat a bag of gummy bears a week back went back when back when not recently but I love them I have to resist them I no longer eat regular gummy bears anymore these gummy bears have one carbohydrate there's tons of CBD gummy bears out there and I used to have a different brand over a year ago but the carbs and the sugar was too much like that is a fast way to gain weight these have one carb zero protein zero sugar zero fat I don't know how they made them but all of the ingredients and everything is on here and these again there's 30 gummy bears in a container and one gummy bear has 25 grams of CBD which is pretty great and there really good I'm almost at these two sometimes I'll just chop on one during the day look if I wanted pizza candy I have a CBD gummy and it doesn't make me too sleepy it's just relaxing okay and then moving on to the drops the drops are the easiest form in my opinion because it's more concentrated and you could put them in other things so you could put them in your lattes you were your coffee in the morning like if you like creamer with your coffee you could replace it with the vanilla flavor the vanilla flavor is so good it is soaked I got one for my friend who wanted to experience EVD he blew through a bottle of the vanilla in a week I thought that was so funny like what were you doing just sucking on the sucking on the dropper let me show you I keep them in the box only because they're glass here's the nola this has 500 milligrams and I believe you could choose there's different options so you don't have to have 500 I think there's ones with lesser milligrams it smells so good and it comes with the dropper so you know how much you're actually dropping into your mouth and there's already recipes online on how to bake with these I haven't gotten to that place I love to bake some going to but you can bake with them you can mix them in your food you could put it in your coffee and it's not too oily I put them in my lattes all the time I make be good vanilla lattes and I use the dropper instead of regular vanilla extract another favorite flavor is creamsicle orange creamsicle this is so good if especially if you'd like orange creamsicles I loved those as a kid and I have cotton candy this one I saved because I haven't tried this yet I wanted to try it I've never had this flavor it's so fun experimenting with the flavors well I don't know about you but I love new treats like I said follow those those Instagram accounts with all the new stuff that comes out like the new Oreos I'm totally a fat kid so I love having new sugary flavors hold on let me get this I don't want to go to bed yet so I'm gonna just do a little bit oh my god you know what it tastes like do you remember the ice cream truck that had the ice Popp oh my god was my favorite ice pop and it was cotton candy it was blue and pink and it was always the coldest ice pop like I feel like you would burn not burn your tongue but almost like ice burn your tongue on it do you guys remember that this tastes just like if I can find a picture of it I'm gonna put it right here this tastes just like that okay so I can't pick a favorite I love sweets there is no favorite when it comes to sugar and Kush I absolutely love it so I didn't want to do this video for you guys I hope that answers some of the questions and basically how I'm using that and if you feel more comfortable trying out a product I suggest the cookies especially with your hot coffee in the morning just trust me have snickerdoodle dipping in your coffee and you let me know how that goes you let me know how you feel if you like them and then pick up the drops if you need them to go to bed because I feel like it's much more relaxing you could do a few drops you lay in bed and you relax you could put them in your bath and there's new bath balm coming I saw that I ordered some because who doesn't love a bath bomb and I just really want to see like what does the dudes is it really make you sleepy I hope I was able to answer some questions about the stuff that I loved from sugar and cush and what I use them for and if it works for me if you happen to her questions definitely leave them down below if I was a little chaotic and all over the place I am on cold medicine and I'm so just out of it from not feeling that well but hopefully you got what you needed from this video and that's it so all the information is gonna be linked down below again leave a comment let me know if you have any other questions I'll do my best to answer them and that's it I hope I see you next time bye [Music] [Music] [Applause]", "gtXD-PH9w0Y": "hello chef here back again with another review for you the viewer I'm trying to help you and educate you on CBD so there you hear CBD every day no matter where you go radio TV billboards pharmacy a friend the gym biking hiking weight lifters hockey players basketball players football players CBB everyone's using it why because it works plant power so CBD is a naturally occurring compound found in the flowers the leaves the stems of hemp plants hemp plants have been used for thousands of years around the world here in the USA we're kind of new or emerging it's now legal in all 50 states basically CBD has lots of therapeutic benefits and there's zero THC and this CBD right here it's all about education and about learning and about getting it from the right source number one you want to get gummies or oil that is organic and non-gmo that's what this is right here and that's why I take this one also you only want to buy CBD after you read and learn about the certificate of analysis certificate of analysis CoA sheet should be posted on every website or given what the product if you buy this at the gas station you're probably going to pay 75 bucks for it I found this and I buy this for eighteen dollars it's great I love it I know exactly what's in here there's zero percent THC I'm confident I could pass a drug test there's no THC I'm looking at the certificate of analysis right there on the website so that's important to me also made in the USA is important to me ingredients knowing exactly what I'm getting yeah there's CBD oil in there and there's coconut oil in there and I know exactly what it is and the milligrams and the servings this is great stuff here I need a few droppers for to feel the effect personally gummies are a lot stronger there are they're encrusted as well as penetrated with the CBD right in there really really nice I'll get up on the camera there for you so the gummies are nice and these are a thousand milligram per jar so that comes out to be about 31 milligrams per gummy yeah they're about a buck buck and a half a piece but man the stress goes away you're gonna better recovery after any physical activities nothing's gonna bother you as far as work-related stress or issues everything's cool it's mellow so I suggest you get out there and check out the the CBD and I get it from this source right here I suggest you check them out and it's good stuff with that said that you never stop learning about CBD so I'm gonna tell you just a little bit more here lots of people have questions like first of all why would I use CBD well it relieves stress it relieves pain helps chronic conditions arthritis anxiety digestion swelling back aches legs fingers hands neck you got pain CBD works also if you're seeking a better night's sleep then this helps trust me you take one of these and after you take it you're gonna doze right off I don't know within a half-hour hour maybe but it doesn't make you Drowsy it just gives you a better night's sleep it's hard to explain the healing properties of CBD are still being tested and confirmed by scientists and by doctors around the world USA is you know moving forward and making some steps for sure by the way this is non addicting it's a safe substance it does not get you addicted it's just plants natural healing power by the way it is safe for cats and dogs the recommended dosage depends on the weight of your cat or dog myself I like to bust these in half or split them with a dog and makes the dog happy especially around fourth of July so uh loud noises and booms and noise really scare dogs and by giving them part of a gummy with the CBD the dogs relax doesn't hurt them so uh let's see one more thing I wanted to go over here recommend the dosage it's really up to you and your body I'm at 200 pounds so for me I kind of like this thirty one milligram gummy of CBD and sometimes I'll take the dropper as well it's eight milligrams so I'd take at least two droppers full the only thing is this can be put in your coffee in your drinks for sure but it's diluted so you're getting coconut oil or other oils be careful where you shop if you buy this at a gas station it could be palm oil fractionalized or corn oil it could be coming from India or Egypt or Russia or somewhere else I have no idea it's all over Europe it's all over the world depends on what you're looking for I like to buy made in the USA it's the safest cleanest purest CBD that I have found like I said it all goes back to the COA sheet the analysis of what exactly is in there where it comes from how its processed and the fact that there is zero percent THC in my gummies in my oil that's important to me so the dosage really depends on your body weight your size your desired effects you might talk with a doctor or health professional to confirm it won't interfere with other medications and please like share subscribe

love to read comments I\nread and reply to every single comment you guys make so if you have tried CBD\ngummies before if you try CBD products before or know anything about this\nsubject I'd love to know please put it in a comment in the comment section\nbelow and give me a cheeky follow on Instagram so in this video we're gonna\nbe covering what is CBD what is CBD used for why make CBD into gummies how\nmuch CBD are actually in these gummies we're gonna look at the smell taste and\ntexture of these specific ones I'm reviewing today also I'll be assessing\nwhat effect they had on me do I prefer them to like CBD oils and how can you\nget your hands on some of these okay so this is the main event this is the CBD\ngummies they are a greenish grape flavoured gummy which is comes in a\npack of 60 but you take one a day so you got roughly about two months in this\nspecific pack I found them very very interesting the box is awesome I love\nthe color of these and I love the packaging I just love really neat I just\nlove really neat packaging look at this I just Oh God so good I love it okay so\nwhat is CBD? let's get into before we look at the details in the raw kind of\nurgh let's talk about CBD what is it so CBD is a cannabidoil  but it doesn't have\nthe psychoactivity that THC has coming from the marijuana plant so CBD is\nhigher in the indica  plant I hope I'm pronouncing this right part of the of\nthe cannabis plant because I think there's male and female cannabis plants\nso the indica don't which one it is but so indica is high in CBD so they use\nthe indica plant to take the CBD out which is how they\nmake things like these gummies and the oils and like creams and stuff like that\nand the cool thing about it is that it has no psychoactivity which is\nmore normally associated with cannabis and marijuana so this is why CBD is\nlegal in most countries it's legal here in the UK now it has been for a couple\nof years and I know it's legal in that most of the USA and part of you know\nEurope and things like that I'm not sure if it's legal everywhere in the world I\nknow that Australia are having an issue with it even CBD oils so I'm just kind\nof lucky that we live in a in a country where this is actually legally allowed\nso what is a CBD used for and that's a great question a lot of people use CBD\nfor things like aches and pains it's it's an anti-cancer supplement as well\nlook I don't know the science behind the specifics of it but they do use it a lot\nof people use it for you know like a cancer prevention thing just like eating\nhealthy and things I got like a food supplement it's also used a lot for\nthings like arthritis and fibromyalgia being on the autism spectrum I know that\nfibromyalgia is very common within females on the autism spectrum\nso CBD oils are used a lot there to help with that but one of the main things\nthat it's used for and one of the things I've used CBD for is anxiety now having\nAsperger's syndrome it comes with a whole host of crazy stuff and one of the\nthings is extremely exciting anxiety about kind of all kinds of crazy stuff I\nget anxiety social anxiety daily anxiety anxiety the postman poster through the\ndoor and that if people phone to me picture my phone thing like oh my\ngoodness you know like you know all this stuff really really freaks me out so I\ntake CBD to try and feel a little less anxious and more relaxed in my day and\nI've been using the CBD oil but I found that I have to take it as and when I'm\nfeeling anxious rather than a daily supplement because it tastes really\nnasty and the oil is kind of it's a bit it's a bit potent when you put it in\nyour mouth so that begs the question is why make it gummies now the reason\npeople made CBD gummies is because again the oil tastes a bit nasty and you've\ngot to take like a quite big dab on your tongue and you know the the oil tastes a\nbit rubbish the oil is very very expensive and this is\nnot fun you know you don't get there davon oil and tabacky or your throat and\nespecially say you're out and about you're traveling or you travel for work\nand you you're using as a pain relief you don't be like opening this like\npipette in the middle of the office meeting just like dabbing in some oil so\nI would say that the reason CVD always existed because it's a more convenient\nway to take it and like it doesn't like sweets or candy if you're American you\nknow like sweets are just great you know you just like punk hey I can give me\nanyway you've been laying in the park be like hey man what's going on I'm having\na great day in the pack sunshine and a feeling about anxious clunk let's take\none of these TVD gummies I'm feeling pretty fly and that to me is way worth\nit because before I knew that they made gummies I was always kind of like oh\nI'll try mix it in with tea so I used to drop the pipette in sysm tea and drink\nwith teas to get rid of the nasty taste and then I'd kind of like put it into\nall all kinds of stuff to put into food you know if you don't like a yogurt or\nsomething or smoothie but you know it wasn't as effective sticking and on the\nin orally directly into your mouth rather than mix it in with something\nelse but when the goes-- were released I thought what a great idea and the lovely\npeople are yummy nutrition actually sent me these to try I've worked on them\nbefore and I did a video on melatonin does melatonin help people with autism\nsleep I will leave a link for that up in the description above here so you guys\ncan check that out as well but this company is really really nice that these\nare all like this is a vegan product as well which I really really like and this\nis the product we are talking about today so these are the yummy nutrition recover\nand destress a CVD 16 gummies food supplement take one a day these are\ngreat flavor and it sounds you in a back here what it's got in it so it's got a\nbit of vitamin E vitamin C and the cannabis kind of at all which is a CBD\nhas 10 milligrams per serving one serving is one CBD gummy so let's let's\nget them or another look they smell phenomenal these things smell\namazing so this is well this is what they look like um these are just like\nthese the little green kind of gummy sweets you know there's nothing amazing\nabout the look of them I know a lot of people kind of make see me to gummy\nbears and gummi whatever but little gummies like these these things so these\nare really cool and a bit more grown-up as well you know you take it like a box\nof best weed still like your meeting again you look kind of a little bit\nchildish maybe I don't know but I just feel like this is way more like\nprofessional slick unlike grown-up and stuff like that they smell amazing the\ntexture it's really really gummy like this in capacitors just like a normal\nsweet that you'd buy like any other sweet the smell is really really great P\nand I really like it Anna yeah so it's really chewy it's full of\nflavor and this is something I noticed when I did the the video with the\nmelatonin gummies they were strawberry flavor and they absolutely tasted\nexactly like strawberry these are such a good flavor so this is the CBD gummy pack as you can\nsee there it's got all information on the front and then it has all the\nnutritional information on the back and you can also reach out to the company on\nsocial media they're really really cool and I tweet them all time on Instagram\nthem and stuff like that so please check them out on social media is all because\nthey're super super awesome if you're interested I did a video on the CBD oil\nfor Asperger's syndrome and autism and I'll leave that in a cat above as well\nif you want to go and check that out because it's obviously related to CBD\ngoes-- to the CBD oil so I thought you might actually want to check out ok so\nnow we've gone over the idea the ideologies the taste of smells the\ntextures the type of sweets these our type of comas these are\nwhat fact did they have on me so like i said i have been using CBD oil for about\na year and i used to take it daily but the taste was so nasty that i used to\ntake it like every other day and then obviously now i just take it as and when\ni'm feeling anxious and it takes a little while to get into your system and\nthen it you know it takes a while for it to kind of just kick in and it's it's\nannoying that i can't just take it in the morning but it's nice to have it\nthere as backup now i've been taking these i k told you\nthis is the fifth day taking these the CBD gummies and i gotta tell you that it\nis the best like relaxer I guess I've had ever so when you when you don't when\nI don't take the CBD I feel kind of like on edge a bit like I've tie in a bit\nworried and anything can trigger me at any one time but when I take the CBD\ngummies it kind of just chills me a little bit more than usual but it also\nmakes me not like stress out about the the smaller things that would really\ntake me off here in a day but like the small things that would take me off tuna\ntoday it doesn't trigger those things but something I will make you aware of\nit's not a cure for anxiety or a cure for being stressed what it does is it\ngets rid of most of it yeah so with autism there are gonna be things\nthat are going to trigger you and cause meltdowns but this will eliminate I\nthink I would say good 80 to 90 percent of it I have to tell you that these are\nthe best things I've ever seen I was so excited when I seen these\nsweets so I reached out to company and said hey look I'd love to do a video on\nthem and they were kind enough to send me this bottle of of them which is which\nis absolutely amazing and yeah I find that taking them in gummy Pharma is when\naccident taking of an oil former and so to me yeah the effects yeah it\ndefinitely helps was like aches and pains I still wake up with like really\nnumb hands and my my feet and hands ache a lot but now having the CBD gummies I\nactually haven't had those aches since taking them because I'm taking them\nduring the day every day and it's been like consistently not for five days so\nI'm feeling pretty awesome when I wake up and I'm feeling super more children\nlaughs and this make me a bit more productive with my work and things like\nthat I'm doing for YouTube so while the side effects of CBD\nthat aren't really any side effects and CVD a lot of people say that it can make\nyou a bit more drowsy bit more sleepy and I've experienced that with CVD but\nonly when I'm already feeling a bit tired during the day it's kind of like\nif you're feeling a bit tired and then you take like a sleepy tea or some more\nmilk you're gonna feel way more chilled and way more tired because it's making\nyou bit more sleepy so CBD is kind of like that if you're feeling really tired\nanyway and you take some CBD there's a potential like you could feel a little\nbit more sleepy I'm not like dangerously sleepy you're not gonna fall asleep in\nyour desk alright the wee little car but I'm just saying that like you know that\nit could be a side effect it's not really a side effect\nso do I prefer CBD gummies to CBD oil yes 100% and I think I'm going to get a\nsubscription with this company to actually have CVD gummies every two\nmonths get a bottle of these and just this is this is awesome I love it I\ncan't believe how good this is I just awesome so if you don't know where to\nget your hands on your very own tub of CBD gummies like this I will leave a\nlink in the description below so I will leave all the links for that in the\ndescription below so you can get your hands on these very CBD gummies if\nyou're really interested in it I'm pretty sure these guys ship worldwide\nbut don't hold me to it make sure you check out the website\nfirst and all the small print but yeah awesome I highly highly recommend these\nand I highly recommend the company they're a manchester-based UK company\nthat make fantastic supplements peace", "fLoc9hP-i0Y": "everybody this is the CBD just CBD gummies the gummy worms I've already started eating some just as a test run one it helps numb the pain a little bit - is where you want to get just right for 500 milligrams but if you do three you are asking to going to a sleep coma and you won't wake up for like an hour or two but I've been through about this whole jar so far I recommend that you try it but keep out of hands of children also it makes them drowsy but definitely get this at any cannabis shop perfectly in Ex exhale or almost any smoke shop", "yEq-IosJLHY": "hello everyone present-day Stephanie here so I found this video a few days before the protest began because of the murder of George Floyd and I didn't know when an appropriate time was to post this video because I clearly do not want to be insensitive to everything that's happening right now but like many of you I have been glued to my phone social media the news and also the last you know I guess how many days I've been I've been out and about at the protests in downtown LA and Hollywood as well and the other day I honestly needed a mental break after coming home from the protest it's been very emotional and powerful but I did need to just I ended up watching some Gordon Ramsay and then I watched him RuPaul so what I was saying is I I think it's okay to take a little bit of a mental break this is something that so many of us hopefully all of us watching this right now are just so passionate about and mad about and and ready to fight to make change for which is already happening but also we need to be able to recharge as well a little bit so I'm not saying that watching a video like this is necessarily an escape but a little bit of a mental break and a little bit of a ability to recharge and then get back out there and do what you can I also did reach out and speak to some of my subscribers out there and asked if this was an appropriate thing to do and they kind of voice the same feelings that I am feeling right now so clearly YouTube videos are a lot more plan they're not necessarily in the moment and right now with what's happening everything is so in the moment it's changing so rapidly so if you want to catch up with me and see what I'm doing in the present moment you can catch me on Instagram I'm posting on there quite a bit any Adsense made from this video I'm going to be donating to blacklivesmatter and I'm planning for at least the month of June any videos I make adsense there I will be donating to an organization affiliated with black lives matter and I also have a very important message at the end of this video that I personally would love more information about and I do need to learn more about and I feel like as a community we need to as well so please stick till the end of the video and yeah I hope you all are staying safe out there I love you all and enjoy what's up everyone AC girl Stephanie and today I am gonna share with y'all some of my favorite CBD products I've been a big fan of CBD for quite some time now is really impacted my life positively as well as other people all around me and Josie's too so before we get into it if you haven't yet please make sure to subscribe below come join the sisterhood no matter your true pronoun or gender identity come join the family alright let's get started okay so before we get into the products let's talk a little bit about what CBD is so CBD stands for cannabidiol which is a chemical compound derived from the cannabis sativa plant aka marijuana CBD is non psychoactive meaning it does not have a strong effect on the brains cognitive activity and doesn't cause the hive associated with marijuana and in fact has been found to have a lot of great health benefits currently there is so much research going on with CBD in terms of cancer research epilepsy but in terms of just 182 CBD in daily life I think I have four health benefits that you know anybody out there would use CBD for these ones I personally use them for so here we go I have pain relief so studies have shown that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity reducing inflammation interacting with neurotransmitters we have anxiety and depression reduction so CBD acts on the brains receptors for serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and social behavior third we have sleep aid so one study showed that CBD improved the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder a disorder in which a person acts out in their dreams RBD is associated with poor sleep and nightmares and then in terms of on the outside personally we have acne treatment so CBD oil may help treat acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to reduce sebum production and also there's a lot of research on CBD in terms of other skin issues like really dry skin eczema and that kind of stuff so those are really the health benefits that I guess I'm gonna be talking about with these particular products and of course we have different ways of using we have ingestion and topical so we're really gonna go through a variety of different products here we're gonna start this off with ingested CBD and this is probably the form that I use the most and these are gummies so here are my favorite ones in particular this is by plus and as you can see I have different kinds here so if we're just starting off with two of these here these are 700 milligrams the CBD per 10 there's 14 gummies in here so that means our 50 milligrams of CBD per gummy that is a lot for a gummy product I actually have now tried and maybe over like 10 different brands of gummies and these are quite small but for me this brand tastes the best but also because there's so much CBD in there and you can taste it a little bit more it's a little bit more bitter obviously with so much packed in there you're not gonna avoid the flavor or like the terpenes of the plant itself so typically because this is 50 all like cut this in half or even into quarters sometimes or you know eat one whole I want to I started taking CBD because of anxiety I definitely deal with daily presence of anxiety I don't think that I have the high some anxiety ever at all but I feel like as a normal person we're all dealing with anxiety you know what issues within our own lives all the time the way that my anxiety Manifest is I just feel like I'm going a million miles an hour while I'm doing nothing and I'll like hold my breath really and I just get really tense and I don't even realize I'm doing it I have to consciously just like let it go CBD really really helps with that it just helps me just relax a little bit and just slow down has absolutely no effect on my brain function like I said or anything it just makes me just relax a little bit more so that's when I started eating these gummies I really like these but the ones I really like these are my favorite just CBD gummies are these ones they are 90 milligrams CBD and 10 milligrams THC now there's a lot of research out there currently that says that CBD is more effective when you have a little bit of THC with it and this is called the entourage effect and it kind of shows that in terms of like the chemical compounds of the plant they work better together than as their individual components so that's why when you look at a product that contains CBD it'll either be full-spectrum broad spectrum or isolate I'm really not going to go too far into that because this is a lot to talk about but I'll just say that full spectrum does have a little bit of THC in there legally for it to be just sold everywhere it has to have under 0.3% I believe so this one is not legal to be sold everywhere I had to get this from a dispensary because in terms of like one dummy actually there's point five milligrams of THC you don't feel it at all when you're eating this one but I do feel like this one in itself gives me the same relaxed feeling the feeling of calm as one of these so this one only has four point five milligrams of CBD per gummy this one has 50 milligrams so I really do believe in that entourage effect there is one more from this company that I think it's worth talking about this is their melatonin gummy this one is 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy one milligram of melatonin so it is a very low amount of melatonin per gummy I find that eating one of these has the same effect as eating like a melatonin pill and I want to say usually those are like five milligrams of melatonin so I really like to use this I don't eat melatonin super regularly but I do have racing thoughts sometimes like I said my anxiety can carry like into the night so sometimes taking something like this really does help and I will say that in terms of like whole flour marijuana or something like that I do use like a little indica pen to go to sleep as well that's pretty much my the scent of my marijuana usage but of course I live in California and it's all legal I use it to help me go to sleep but sometimes if I just have this I don't need that the pen at all I do know on their website you can purchase any of these separately and you can also buy these three as a pack which I did and like I said I had to get the one with th seed a little bit of THC and they're from a dispensary another brand of gummies that I do enjoy our CBD effects and this brand in itself has so many options for CBD they have got like gummies tinctures everything so and I believe on the site that might even have packs you know that you can have a variety pack of different things so if you're just looking into like diving into CBD and just trying whatever you want this is a great company to go to I like the concert or this one and itself too because it's pretty small pack I think they're like eight gummies or there were four gummies no eight gummies in here these ones for only five milligrams per gummy so you're not going crazy oh oh like going 50 milligrams and you don't have to obviously cut it up all by yourself so if you're really very new to CBD I think this is a a brand to look into I think that they have one like small pack like this left and it's there like spirulina you're not gonna get this specific flavor but you're gonna get the same like five milligrams CBD gummies another thing actually that I really do want to circle back to about doing your research is you really have to look at the ingredient list in the back and if you can't see it if they're not displaying it on the website do not buy from that website because there are some brands they label their CBD like gummies in particular like extra chil CBD and actually they've added melatonin to it without telling you explicitly on the packaging like you look at this one it's called sleep blackberry tea with melatonin there was one brand that my sister really liked no where on the packaging did it say CBD with melatonin but she was like Stephanie these ones are so good for sleep every time I just eat one of these gummies it knocks me out right away and I was like whoa that sounds like it's a little bit too relaxing but maybe my sister's just very sensitive to CBD so I bought it and I remember it was like 5:00 p.m. I was working on my computer and maybe like 45 minutes later I was like I'm so tired right now what's going on at first it felt like I was just like really relaxed so I was like this is crazy this did not have that much CBD in it and also like it's making me not just relax but really sleepy then I just went ahead and looked at the packaging and you know back here it said melatonin I was just shocked because I went on the website on the page of the gummi know we're on there to say anything about melatonin until you went to this teeny little ingredient list at the very bottom area that you had to like click a tab for and then under everything it said melatonin so just do your research and look over everything before buying a product and if a product doesn't explicitly say that has something like melatonin in it I'm not sure if I would trust that brand so next up after gummies the product that I use the most are tinctures so I have two here for you I have one by Lorde Jones this is their royal oil a thousand milligrams CBD and then I have this one by anda which is their full-spectrum CBD hemp extract now the Lord Jones royal oil is advertised as being topical and I do use it in that way as well but I didn't have the pleasure of meeting one of the cofounders of Lord Jones Cyndi Capobianco and she did tell me that this isn't just about as well because all that's in here is I believe grapeseed oil and the CBD oil one dropper pool is 40 milligrams of CBD so maybe I'll you know do half put it underneath my tongue and just hold it there for a minute if you're really not trying to mess with a lot of added ingredients you don't want you know any sugars or anything from the gummies this could be a great way to go and it is a very multifunctional product because I do have some neck shoulder pain issues and this is a product this is the first really effective CBD product that I found to really help with my my pain in my neck I think especially topically the thing that I really grasp about CBD is that it reduces inflammation and inflammation can be the cause of a lot of bodily issues in terms of pain management skin issues a lot of it has to do with inflammation and this product actually what they recommend is to use it in your skincare so you could put it in your moisturizer a little drop of that or even end it just on your face but like I said this one I use mostly for ingestion and if I were to put it topically like on my shoulder and then this one by and I just wanted to mention it because I haven't used it too much but I have seen a friend who does like this brand I need to look into it a little bit more I believe actually the all the packaging has changed very drastically since I received this one but if you are looking into another brand if you look into this one if you just don't want to taste anything at all you don't want to deal with any oils you don't want to deal with any gummies we have capsules here for you of course so I have two here where I'm from CBD effects again it's one these little envelopes there is 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule and then we have a little jar here of the Lord Jones hemp derived CBD gel capsules this one as well has 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule you know in terms of all these methods of ingestion it really comes down to I guess just your preference personally for me a lot of CBD is about the process I guess and it is I hey it's the word of like mindfulness of understanding that I am you know rubbing this thing on me or eating this thing to help calm me down or to help me in some way so I enjoy that aspect of CBD cuz it makes me kind of focus and be like okay just chill out this is what I'm trying to do to help myself so it's a little bit of a self-care moment if you don't need that moment for yourself like go ahead and just take a capsule or you know this could be that process for you as well I personally have not used these too much because I enjoy using the other ways but I have gifted these to friends you know a bunch of these in the bottle I have gifted to a friend and they were dealing with some real pain issues in their back and they said that this one really helped them along with other products I did give them though I'll talk about the other one in a sec it but yeah this is just a way that you'd want to ingest EBD go ahead and try it in terms of incorporating CBD into your daily life I have been enjoying some these products that make it even more of I guess like a ritual so I have a couple honey products here so this first one is from potli this is their cannabis infused raw honey this has 100 milligrams of CBD and 10 milligrams of THC so this is another one of those that you might have to purchase from a dispensary I believe this one is only sold in California and again because it has the little bit of THC in there you get that entourage effect to make it a little bit more effective this is something that I would put into you know anything that you want honey some tea you put it on some granola it just incorporates CBD in another way into your daily life without maybe making it feel so Medical like you're not taking a tincture or a capsule you just have it in your honey and this honey tastes great this brand potli is wonderful the founders are fell and Christine very are my Faria girls and I feel like they're killing it I have another product here from them that I want to talk about this is a product that I really really like and then if you're looking for one that has absolutely no teach C in there that you could just purchase online this one is from iki pers natural this is their beat chill raw honey and hemp there is 500 milligrams high potency hemp oil which is CBD in there I actually personally know the founder of bee keepers Naturals as well which is so cool so now I've talked about three female or four female founders but her name is Carly Stein she started bee keepers naturals because she actually has grown up has lived with her whole life with an autoimmune disorder and she found that natural bee products like propolis and royal jelly and I guess now added with CBD actually really helps with her extra so you're looking for just a really nice honey that has some CBD in there as well but no THC you can look into this one I have one more food product here again from potli and this is their hemp infuse extra virgin olive oils so this is cold-pressed estate Tuscan olive oil with 250 milligrams of hemp derived CBD again just one of those products where you can put it on to a salad you know just put it into your daily life and this olive oil is like really really delicious this is my highlight my special occasion not a special occasion but I wouldn't I would not cook with this olive oil I would use it for something raw I mean my favorite dressing for our salad would be some olive oil and some nice balsamic vinegar and we're good to go so you're fairly new to CBD and the idea of taking a pill or gummy or something is not practical for your life but you are a tea drinker or you're a salad eater you know this could be the form that would fit into your lifestyle earlier I mentioned my friend who I gave these capsules to who was having some really bad back problems I'm not sure it she it was like a pinched nerve feeling but she's not positive that's what it was but it made her very immobilize some of this one for her to put on topically and this is the bebo therapy's high potency CBD body balm there is 750 milligrams of CBD in this jar so topically what this balm claims to do is to reduce inflammation so if you're having just general body aches maybe just from working out this is a product that you could rub onto your muscles to help you out the other day Michael had a really weird back spasm it happened while he was bike riding and thankfully he wasn't that far away I think he was just like in Chinatown so I had to drive and go pick him up like he could not move his back was in so much pain it was actually really scary but when we go home he took a hot shower and then I rubbed this on its back for him oh no it was it was like his shoulder within his shoulder blade down his back you know some it was really weird but I rub this onto him for like half an hour and what they do recommend is to keep this on for at least half an hour and I think that it really helped obviously it's a combination of things like he took a hot shower clearly I'm giving him a massage which I think in itself helped there are other ingredients in here a lot of really nice oils that could help but in itself as a balm I feel like it does give some relief the CBD in there gives some real relief in terms of physical aches and pains this one plus the Royal oil are ones that I personally have used on my back and my neck for the pains that I have and you know when you're rubbing it on yourself you clearly can't really work it in and I personally have felt just that strain and my neck down to my shoulder just like loosen up after having this on for an hour it just says it just feels so much better even now like I still have the issues if I'm doing this all I'm hearing is just like I can't got crack all throughout my back you know just when I'm on my computer I'm hunched over and that's my tension as well that's my stress I I carry all in my shoulders and I hold my breath when I'm doing stressful things so all of it all CBD kind of helps me with those issues without having you know necessarily to take the next step into taking other things I will say this bomb is not the most friendly in terms of soaking into the skin it definitely is one that's great for massages because you can just keep working working working with it it does not soak in that well but that just means that a little bit goes a really long way because if you just use a teeny tiny bit of it it will obviously spread thin and soak in but it just is it's just I know it smells great it's a really nice bomb but yeah be careful if I don't know laying down on your white sheets or anything because it does a little bit of a tint on there and if you're slathering it on you know clearly you see that it has a color to it we're gonna jump into some other skin care products before we really hop into the face stuff there's another bomb here by Lord Jose and this is their high CBD formula body balm and this has 200 milligrams of CBD in there so you know this one over here has 750 this is 200 I would say if you are looking for something for aches and pains and those kind of things for inflammation of the muscles this is one that I would more recommend this one I don't even think that they don't claim anything about helping your muscles or helping aches and pains this one is just like a balm that you would put on for really dry skin the thing that lower John's really talks about in terms of CBD with this product is that it is very soothing and very a restorative ingredient and it is really good for dry cracked skin so especially now that we are all washing our hands so much using so much hand sanitizer this is the kind of product that like at the end of the day I'll like rub on my knuckles and my cuticles of course like I said with the previous product there are other ingredients within this like beeswax and oils that do help with that I think this product is a good example of how CBD can be really incorporated into your regular products in your everyday life it's not a miracle ingredient every single time they're claiming in this one that is just good for you know maybe some dry skin some cracked skin it's not going to solve your arthritis or anything so just do your research I guess on the product with CBD that you're purchasing so I have two more skincare products here another one from Lourdes Jones I just you know I think Lourdes Jones is maybe was the first CBD brand to go into Sephora they really did break out in the high-end skincare realm I really don't know a lot of other skincare brain ants that have CBD in them so that's why there's so much Lord Jones products if you have any recommendations for me please let me know in terms of CBD skincare clearly I have a lot of other brands that I like with CBD but I just haven't seen much CBD skincare that I really like because Lord Jones uses some really awesome ingredients outside of the CBD but yeah if you have any recommendations for me please let me know the thing in terms of skincare from Lord Jones I think I really like I really really like the most and this is probably the newest one for me is their whole plant formula acid mantle repair this is a CBD moisturizer this is quite a rich cream I am an oily person this is good for all skin types so typically this is my nighttime cream and it's this is gonna last me a long time because I've been using this for a minute and it looks like I haven't even really skimmed the surface you don't need that much at all along with the CBD there are some really great ingredients there's hyaluronic acid so it's highly moisturizing but because it does have the CBD in there it is really a restorative kind of ingredient it is great for acne and it's so funny because I do really love just scrolling through online reviews whether they be really bad or really good and it's it's awesome because on Sephora there are so many positive comments about this from people who look dry skin people who have acne prone skin it just seems like an all-around great very positively reviewed product so if you're looking for a really nice nighttime moisturizer if you are oily or disah all day everyday moisturizer if you got dry skin yeah this is just a really great straightforward moisturizer and the last product for the face that I have here is the Saint Jane luxury beauty serum again this is kind of one of those products that supposed to be for all skin types it has 500 milligrams a full spectrum CBD with 20 potent botanicals so it supposed to hydrate detoxify help with dullness uneven skintone wrinkles it's just kind of supposed to be yeah a miracle serum I haven't been using it for that long but I will say I feel like my skin is glowing afterwards I did have some breakouts that I had like I want to say they started like a week and a half ago I really consistently was using both of these at nighttime and my chin is just like really cleared up and I thought that there was gonna be more popping up but it did kind of back back then they went back in there so I'm gonna continue using this one I would say out of any of the skin products this is the one that I've used the least and it is also the most luxury product that I have here so I'm really being stingy with it but also again from all the reviews that I've read online a lot of different people with different skin types really have been enjoying this product hi Joe I just woke Josie up from snoring heavy sometimes when I'm recording now she just starts snoring so loud that I do have to I have to wake her up because she's just right here in front of the camera well speaking of Josie we do have a product for her this is the blossom full spectrum hemp oil this has 300 milligrams per bottle here this is the one I purchased for medium dogs you administer 0.25 milliliters per 25 pounds of pet weight CBD for pets is super effective I I feel like it might even be the most friendly gateway into CBD for a lot of people because they see immediate effects in their pets whether it be giving it to them during you know hard car rides where dogs have a lot of anxiety during that time or with fireworks so there was one night for some reason that there was a bunch of fireworks going on all outside Josie was a little bit nervous she's not usually nervous about loud noises but I think Michael wasn't around so it made her a bit nervous and I gave her some of the CBD and she calmed right down it was very I don't know it was pretty amazing and I have you know babysat other dogs where they're really anxious dogs and CBD just helps so much so I feel like just in that to see how CBD works for your loved animal and how it calms them down is just a really great testament to how effective CVD can be for you it's all not saying that everything you would give your dog is be good for you but I'm just saying we have a direct example there I do like this brand I feel like there are a lot of CBD for pet brands and a lot of the brands that I'm showing here let me see I know this one onda I saw on their website they have one specifically for dogs so I feel like a lot of brands that make CBD is just smart for them to also make it for pets as well so I would definitely recommend tinctures I'm not so sure about treats but I'm sure those are you know also effective I just have one last form of CBD not for pets but for humans and that is just the flower here so these are from Lowell smokes first off I have their premium hemp smokes so you can actually buy these from Lowell smokes it's just hemp and in this pack they also give you these little matches the packaging little smokes just kills it with the packaging is very very smart and I have gone through a good number of these little pre-rolls like I said I feel like for me personally part of CBD is the ritual and I am NOT a big just like weed smoker like I went sit down and smoke I was gonna say blunt I wouldn't go it's a ton of smoke a lot maybe you know back in my bay area days maybe but I went to sit down and smoke a joint on any given day but I do enjoy that process of sitting down lighting it and just relaxing with it so in a way I can I can have that without the high and we have it here with these CDP rolls if you don't want to have a whole approval because I understand I'll usually have to just like smoke a little bit of it put it out and then doesn't necessarily taste that great you know when you have to relight a joint they also just have the flower so this right here is 3.5 grams or 1/8 of the CBD hemp flour it's just crazy because in my mind like this just this is weak but yeah there's no THC in there it is just CBD is just hump and you can put this in your little pipe and smoke it so that's another option for you if you just really want to have that also I feel like if you're trying to not smoke so much weed but you enjoy that process this could be a great thing you know for you to do just smoke a little CBD so you're you're you having your ritual but you're not getting super stoned all right all those are all of my CBD products I have to show you it was a lot but I wanted to give you some options and I honestly I didn't realize that I really use a lot of sea wheedies so I hope you enjoyed this video before we close this up I did want to touch upon this in that you know currently marijuana is legal in California and in a lot of other states decriminalized in certain states I believe and it really is moving quite rapidly a lot of people a lot of companies are making a ton of money now in this industry and yet there are still thousands of people currently incarcerated for charges as small as carrying marijuana just possession and as a user of these products we need to be mindful and understand and become educated and become advocates for people who are currently in jail for crimes that are no longer criminal and I mean shouldn't not have been criminal in the first place I know myself I need to become more educated on the subject so I would love to hear from you any suggestions for anything that all of us should read about any kind of information or charities or organizations that we should look into because there's there's a lot of information out there but it's hard to really weep through it so I would love your help on that and I would love to be more educated and with that said I hope y'all are well and hope you are staying healthy and safe there's a lot of stuff going on right now and I hope this video maybe gave you a little bit of a break from that and I love you and I will see you in the next video bye", "m51kj3LBlv4": "what's going on the guys it's George and welcome back to my channel or welcome my channel my name is George and today guys we're going to de-stress relax and talk about CBD this is a product that was made aware of that I could not wait to try these are vegan CBD gummies by not Potts know I am NOT a vegan disclosure although CBD is legal under federal law it is still subject to regulation when it's sold claim to have a therapeutic benefits so know that these gummies cling to promote good vibes only and the benefits stuff such as sleeping pain anxiety your mood and I can definitely pick me up and all those apartments often so if you guys are interested in hearing my review on the NAP hot gummies then keep on watching some of you guys might be wondering why is he talking about with CBD products that's irrelevant to your channel you talk about skincare grooming and men's beauty but guys beauty comes from within as well you need to take care of yourself you need to de-stress you need to do whatever it takes to possibly have sanity first and foremost these gummies did not contain any component to get you high no THC nothing of that nature this is no psychoactive product it is simply just therapeutic not Paes ethically sourced from hemp not marijuana and it is legally available for anyone in the United States also they are partnered with small-scale farmers from Oregon in Colorado which is pretty cool I don't have much experience with CBD but I have tried a CBD pen before and let me just say it claimed to have the same type of effects benefits but the result was just nothing like I got from these maybe you're wondering what CBD is and like I said I'm not a CBD expert but you can find out tons of information about not only this product but CBD the manufacturing process and the benefits of CBD on not pot comm of course I believe that in a link in the description down below without digging too deep into this I definitely recommend for you to check out the ingredients on the website just so you're familiar with what exactly this contains and also it's a good idea to speak to your doctor before trying because CBD although it is claimed to be therapeutic it does affect everybody I feel it differently so it's good to maybe like have a consultation with your doctor about this before before having a enjoyable company and feeling less stressed but now I like I said I'm not too familiar with what CVD exactly is just the benefits that it promotes so good thing is like I said on the website it does have tons of facts about CBD and what exactly the product does and contains so one thing I found to be cool on here was it explains what are cannabinoids and I heard that word cannabinoids and I was like what the heck yeah I'm obviously a Martian when it comes to CBD but it did fill me in I feel pretty good about my knowledge on CBD right now after looking into this so I'm gonna read to you from the website what cannabinoids are cannabinoids I'm probably Necedah over that word like a million times so bear with me says here cannabinoids are the main chemical compounds made by the cannabis plants and there are least there are at least 113 active cannabinoids rights identified in cannabis out of all the known cannabinoids THC I'm not gonna like try to pronounce this word is the only one that's psychoactive cannabinoids work by binding the receptors and our endocannabinoid system ECS so it sounds very scientific but um disclosure I guess it's good to know so the main question here how did I feel after taking a not pot gummy well I said before the pen did not have any type of results benefit for me but I must say these have more of a reaction for me for some reason the gummies taste quite amazing they're very fruity cuddly tropical tasting but the effect did mellow me out it relieved a headache I took this after I got out of work and after working like nine ten hours I usually get kind of a headache not on a daily basis but if it's towards the end of the week a long week I get headaches like every other normal person so this is definitely a reliever in my opinion so I like that factor that's definitely something that I found to be a benefit as far as like putting me in a better mood um I didn't really notice any mood changes and I have not taken these before bed yet because I have my own concoction I make before bed a sleeping pill sometimes not every night but I don't really want to rely on CBD for like a sleeping method but I'm sure it is something that a lot of people may benefit from on the other hands this does claim to also help out with like anxiety I don't really have much anxiety at least I don't think my partner says something else but maybe it's like a mild case of anxiety but I don't really have that so it really can make the 100% determination whether or not it benefits anxiety so overall these did mellow me out helped out with a headache that's good enough for me now these go for $35.99 for a 30-day supply and I notice I have not been taking these everyday I only have been popping one of these gummies in when I felt like I could use a little pick-me-up I absolutely loved the marketing that this company provides not hot your marketing is fun it is very psychedelic very hippie esque very like bold I don't know they have cool things on your chill AF not Potts legal just really fun sayings on the bottle itself the bottle is very very cool I like how it just I don't know it's a bowl I like it I like bold stuff and it smells amazing these gummies just like any other gummy bear that you find there are like a cream color just like this and yeah didn't really need one right now but you wanna know what it's not gonna go to waste I just love how this brand promotes not being like psychedelic or psychoactive with this component but yet their packaging looks very like I don't know 60s is this 60s now whatever the hippies whatever air they run I love that they also send me a little bag like this which my partner already claimed is his and some cool stickers with sayings on it self-love free plants and people we want to free both of them of course yeah very fun guys I highly recommend checking this company I also have another bottling here but this again is an honest review this is not a paid sponsorship I don't have any affiliate link I love any type of sponsorship with not pot but this is honestly something I feel like anybody that is interested in trying out CBD should try it is easy to consume tastes pretty good and really does make a difference I have like you said again try to do pen before and that's not too many thing for me I love gummies I have gummy vitamins I take every single day so I'm not taking gummy for a nice little therapeutic moment well that is pretty much it for this video guys hopefully I inform you a little bit about CBD again I'm not a professional but this is a fun product I had fun trying this out I'm gonna continue using this and if there's any update on my type of like reaction or benefits of course update the description in this video and with that being said guys hopefully you enjoyed this hopefully found this to be helpful if not but with that being said guys I'm gonna end this on a good note self-love is extremely important you want to take care of yourself not just at the gym not just at beauty products but also on the inside and your brain

CEO want to thank you for stopping by to check out this explainer video of green roads CBD infused relax bears that's right see buddy making a ton of noise within not just sports nutrition but the world so today we're going to talk to you about a nice little convenient product these are the on the go packets of relaxed bears from green roads but they also provide it in a bottle form as well for those of you who want to store it at home so today we want to dive into this and discuss it to you a little bit more so CBD in general what does CVD well though these are cannabinoids okay cannabinoids receive II D is a is a spectrum of various cannabinoids that are they say are over a hundred of them but right now the industry is really focused on anywhere from five to seven so you typically see C be laid out in three different variations CBD I slit which is Iceland CBD and isolate cannabinoid there is CBD broad spectrum which is a broad spectrum of cannabinoids that does not contain THC the THC is removed and then there's what they call full spectrum CBD which can contain up to 0.3 percent THC green Rhodes uses broad spectrum which means this is th free CBD CBD per research studies have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety can help alleviate pain and discomfort these are the big the big benefits of CVD that people are looking for the big difference here between relax bears the gummies and their oil is essentially the application how you use it the CBD gummies you eat just like a gummy bear the oil is an application that you put underneath your tongue for about thirty seconds now I'll tell you that they both work great but the relaxed Bears taste better because CBD oil straight doesn't have the best taste to it so what is going on here with these CBD gummies these relaxed bears from green woods well these are pretty simple and the I'm the gold package you get five gummies you get ten milligrams of CVD per gummy for a total of fifteen milligrams of CD which is a sufficient dosage especially for people trying CBD for the first time now a big thing with gummies as it can compared to say the oil is it's gummies it's going to have sugar aka carbohydrates so what we recommend here that find how we've been using the CBD gummies is we actually use it pre-workout typically with a higher stimulant pre-workout powder why well stimulants albeit can call biet are good for energy production too much can provide anxiety and too much stimulus can provide this crazy anxiety so taking the relaxed bears from green Rhodes pre-workout helps alleviate that anxiety while still getting the full benefit of the stimulants in terms of energy wise of that pre-workout another cool thing about relaxed bears pre-workout is it does contain those carbohydrates so you are getting 15 grams of carbs per packet that 15 grams of carbs it's simple simple carbohydrates which means it's going to go into your body quickly it's gonna it's going to increase your blood glucose levels which is gonna cause your body to release insulin the reason why it's good pre-workout is you get that glycogen up for energy and you have bigger fuller pumps while reducing anxiety now that's not to say you can't have relax bears at any time of the day you can but the biggest benefit that we see the relaxed bears for us and those in the fitness community is really pre-workout post-workout as well would be nice to help alleviate discomfort any sort of pain from the workout restore glycogen stores quickly but you can have a slight crash from simplified carbohydrates or simple carbohydrates like if you have that Vegas skills for instance you might have a slight crash so this for us is a versatile product we like the on-the-go packets because they're quick convenient you can take them honestly on the go but they do have the bottle variation as well the CBD is a full spectrum CD which means there's no THC you're getting good cannabinoids it does seem to work in terms of alleviating stress and anxiety it's a unique flavorful way to get your CVD daily these are delicious they literally tastes just like candy you don't taste the CBD in at all and green roads is a company that is pioneering the CBD movement partaking in legislation helping out with regulation and enforcement and with quality controls each of their packet contains a QR code as you see here you as a consumer can scan that QR code it takes you 2/3 tested results so not done by green roads who have done by a third party to insure you that you actually are getting real CVD in your product in an industry that's blowing up so quickly there's many copycat brands out there providing absolutely no CVD but making a ton of money off it that's not green roads each and every single one of green roads products including their oils their gummies even their topicals all have that QR code that you can scan with your iPhone or your Android device and verify that you're actually getting a CBD prac relax bears from green roads pretty cool product pretty neat very simple in terms of its just sugar and CBD essentially so pre-workout is where we love it the most but it definitely helps you get that CBD in daily fifty milligrams if you take five of these a day in terms of the on-the-go packets or you can obviously pick and choose how many you want to take given how you decide to buy the product you guys want to purchase this product look below for a link to take you over the green roads website to purchase this there is a link below that takes you to

[Music]", "eiyrIiRPsF0": "[Music] hi friends welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is amanda and today i am bringing you another cbd review penguin cbd was kind enough to send me these products to test in exchange for a review so thank you so much penguin cbd and i do want to point out that all opinions are my own and they are honest so if you're interested please continue to keep watching before i head into my review i do want to remind you that everyone's bodies are different and they could react to cbd differently so this is just my opinion and how it worked for me so it could have a completely different reaction or effect on you so let's go ahead and get started first off i'm going to start with the penguin cbd oil this is in the flavor citrus and it has 250 milligrams of cbd in here and it is broad spectrum cbd oil first off look at this packaging this is super cute and i love how cute and modern this is so definitely love that i feel like patch packaging is like the first thing that catches your eye it's a dropper and you just fill it up to one milliliter and that's pretty much the recommended dose dosage then you're supposed to put it under your tongue for 60 to 90 seconds and then swallow i want to point out that this is my first time using cbd oil so take my review with a grain of salt because i don't have anything to compare it to you but first off the flavor it is again citrus flavor i do like the citrus flavor even though it's a little bit light if you like citrus you'll probably like it um i if i wanted to repurchase it again i would definitely choose this flavor i can i tried taking this both times of day so during the day or during the night and i didn't really notice too much of an impact or an effect on me i feel like on average maybe one out of four times it would make me feel a little bit more relaxed but i do want to say that i have been kind of chill like in general the past couple weeks so i don't know i just didn't really notice it making me even more calm because i was kind of already calm to begin with also after i swallowed the oil i don't know if this is common but it made my throat feel a little bit scratchy so i would have to like drink water afterwards or something like that i don't know if other oils do that or if it's just an oil thing but that's just what i noticed when i was using it next let's move on to the cbd gummies first off the packaging is super cute again i really like this and it just has like a chill vibe like look at that rainbow ombre color it's just a very positive packaging the taste so i love these gummies these taste like gummy worms or did i say like even better i feel like they're even more sour than regular gummy worms they look very similar so this is what the gummy worms look like the sugar crystals are a little bit bigger than regular gummy worms but yeah i just feel like it's more sour and i actually really like them you can barely tell that they're cbd gummies because they just taste so good so if you're looking for sweetie gummies that actually taste like gummy worms these are it there is 10 milligrams of cbd in each gummy worm and that's like the recommended daily uh intake so that's what i stuck with and there are about 30 gummy worms in here i did try testing it during the different times of day so i tried taking it during the day and at night and i didn't really notice any benefit for me i didn't really change the way that i felt or made me feel any more calm or less than i already was so i didn't really notice a difference on me but again i was pretty calm the past couple weeks so that might have to do with it as well overall i didn't notice a huge impact in my relaxation while using these products everybody's bodies are different so they could improve your health and well-being so it is worth trying but again for for myself personally they didn't work out too well let me know if you have any questions in the comments and i'll leave the link to penguin cbd in the description box below in case you're interested in trying out these products if this video helped you don't forget to give it a like and subscribe for more video reviews like this i hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye you", "e2VDBa6rKlk": "True or false, CBD actually helps relieve pain, true or false? The answer is true, overwhelming true. The great thing about CBD, and by the way, this is anecdotal, but the reports have been experiences that it can help relieve pain, it may reduce inflammation. It does for me.\nOkay. It can reduce anxiety and stress, people take it for that. So there are a lot of things that have been reported about what CBD does. The research is still ongoing, and they need to catch up to it because a lot of people are reporting this, but no really scientific studies have confirmed it, which doesn't mean it doesn't happen, by the way, it just means we haven't confirmed it scientifically, but people are reporting this, and lots of people, as you said, are using it because of that. For me, I find a very big difference in the quality of product that I'm using. Yes.\nYou know, and you have to try several to find something that actually works for you. But I can physically see the inflammation in my elbows. It looks like a baseball some days, you know, from my tendonitis.\nYes. And if I use the CBD that I'm happy with now, that literally I can physically see it with my eyes, the pain has lessened, but the inflammation lessons as well.\nIs down. So this is a good segway to this part. So CBD comes in all types of products. When you go to the stores, you're gonna see it in all different ways, and I wanna kind of guide you through how to choose what you want. Here are some examples of things that you might find, and there are more than this, by the way, but this is a bath powder. So people put these into their bath, they dissolve it into the--\nI've actually never seen it in bath powder, but I think that makes sense-- Yeah.\nBecause people soak to relieve pain and inflammation as well. 100%, and so it gets into your skin and it gives you that soft tissue relief that you're looking for. Lots of lotions out there. I see a lot of these beauty stores and cosmetic stores, they have it in the lotions-- I use a balm.\nOr some of the pharmacies. It's like a very thick-- Right.\nDense balm. That's right, so it's thick sometimes like a salve, or it's like a nice, thin lotion, so they're all different types depending on what you want to get out of it. There are capsules that you can take. Yep.\nThen, what you were mentioning earlier for Isaboo, there are tinctures. You have a little dropper, and it tells you how much to take. You put it on your tongue, boom, that's it. And then, this is what I wanted to talk to you about, a pain rub, so this is a freeze right here. It's not, just not about the CBD by the way. That is a primary ingredient, but it's about other components. So the question is you need to be able to get the CBD and the pain relief chemical into your skin-- Right.\nSo it depends on what else that the manufacturer puts in there to help it seep into the skin. You say that you do it, you know, for your-- Very dense, kind of a clear, like a salve-- Yes, yes, yes.\nYou know, a balm. And you really have to rub it in-- Right.\nIt's very dense. You rub it in, and then they have certain chemicals that will help it go into your skin and provide that relief 'cause remember, the CBD and other cannabinoids, they bind to receptors in your nervous system, and that is what gives you the relief. The first thing is you wanna be very clear that it actually says--\nCBD. CBD.\nPeriod! 'Cause that's, right. CBD, it's gotta say that, number one. Number two, so you wanna look to see what it says about THC. THC free.\nThis says THC free, very good. The other thing is, you wanna make sure it tells you what type of CBD it is. This is very important, pay attention. So here it says pure isolate. What that means is that the product is 99.9% CBD. It's as pure as you can get it, so it doesn't have any THC. But there's also something called broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means that not only does it have CBD, it has the other cannabinoids I mentioned before, other good chemicals for you, it's broad spectrum. And lastly, there's something that is called full spectrum. This is where you have to pay attention. Full spectrum means it actually has THC, okay? So, when you see isolate, that's pure CBD. When you see broad spectrum, it's other cannabinoids, but still no THC. When you see full spectrum-- It includes the THC. Please look at the ingredient list because you wanna know actually what's in there, so make sure you do that, and lastly, make sure it tells you how many milligrams are on here, right?\nAnd that's where you get that huge price discrepancy. Ah, there you go. There you go.\nThat's right. So what happens is if the price looks too good to be true... It is. It ain't true.\n(laughs) Because CBD costs money, and so if you want high quality, I'm not saying you have to break the bank on it. And it's buyer beware, like you really do have to study up on this, you can't just dive in and go out--\nPlease. And look, the last thing\n(applause) I wanted to say is, the last thing I wanna say is this. A lot of these products have a QR code on it, and you can take your phone and put it up and look at the certificate of analysis. Make sure that the product has been third party tested, which means they've sent it out to a third party lab to test to make sure it has what it says it has and doesn't have what you don't want-- That's so true of every supplement and vitamin.

"what's up youtube budget baller here with another quick one take review today i got the 3g delta 8 thc gummies i got 400 milligrams of delta 8 thc per pack milligrams in each little gummy and 16 gummies per pack and this retails for 39.99 if you want a quick brief history about what this is uh it's a cbd gummy basically made with delta 8 thc which is basically like the brother of delta 9 or the thc that you would normally find in marijuana delta a contains similar psychoactive properties as its little big brother delta nine thc but the catches it is still federally legal here in the united states um the problem with delta eight is it's very hard to get it concentrated to give you like a real high it doesn't exist too much in abundance however companies are finding way like 3g to concentrate the delta h delta 8 to give you um a nice cool relaxing experience i took mine about four hours ago it's starting to wear off a little bit uh it came the high high quotation marks came about an hour and a half in and i will tell you if you've tried cbd gummies and you don't feel like you're getting anything out of them like they're not getting you that relaxing feeling that you want uh 3g delta 8 thc gummies did it for me past two and a half hours my body's been really chill kind of relaxed um a little bit tingly just nice i've been having a real nice feeling what i don't have is too much of the head high or feeling like oh hi or any kind of the psychoactive properties they don't feel like they're they're you get that kind of head high that you get with the some strains of marijuana you get just a more like peaceful relaxed chill feeling and i honestly think like that's what i've been looking for in cbd gummies and this is not a sponsored video by the way this is just me being truthful i like these you i tried multiple cbd gummies and they haven't given me that chill relaxing feeling at night when i'm just chilling that i wanted but this did like i i feel good right now um i've had a little bit of trouble filming these videos uh today because i mean i feel like you know i'm pretty chill like i'm not on top of my game as much as i would but i wanted to do this um i want to get this out there because is it worth it even at 39.99 a pack definitely definitely this is cool this i like this experience i had a good experience with these sorry guys this budget baller uh thank you for liking subscribing doing all that i really appreciate it um have a great day and then i'm gonna close out on the pack for you here there you go nice little look on it cool see it", "cFdOv1RAHJY": "hi everyone um its I think like midnight right now and um I just came back from like a rafting trip and unbeknownst to me we rafted like 14 miles or something like that and I was stuck in a raft full of like people who like didn't want to raft so they like didn't do a lot of work and you know what of paddling so right now I am in a fair bit I'm not in pain but I am sore I do have to go to work oh my god so crazy looking I do have to go to work um I'm like fix this light nope still look crazy I have to go to work tomorrow and right now it's like my shoulders are sore oh that really hurts so yeah like my arms are sore like here and here and then my wrists hurt um I don't know my neck is okay it's just mostly it like you know from going like this I really the show good hair is still wet and go to bed so figure now is a good time as any to try my new CBD gummies my life hurts okay so these are can a sour gummy worms right over here look and here is eat back and again there's no ingredients out here well the oil what okay so the ingredients are here on the bottom and so basically it's like I'm gonna assume gummy worm ingredients plus hemp oil and if they're 500 milligrams so that means that oh there's like five gummy worms in here so it's that's a lot of milligrams so normally I would break this up and like with other edibles of the past like I had like frogs that were like 25 milligrams each or something like that and I like broke them into five pieces so for this I would normally break I I was planning I can't talk about breaking them in half but I'm not gonna do that um I'm just gonna eat one whole and I will smells like plastic I will check back after my shower are supposed to see how I feel and if I don't do that I'll check back tomorrow but let's take this one out it's really sad because it's like if I just ate half you know I don't know I'm gonna do 500 yeah I feel like I should just break this in half let's not waste waste nut Lana all right I just feel like a hundred milligrams is just a lot there okay sets into pieces and saving the other piece so basically I have oh this is such a bad video I'm sorry guys 500 milligrams so this is 50 milligrams and I'm gonna eat this ready these don't taste too bad um a lot of the that means that I've had in the past always have like like a CVD tasting undertone or they just tasted awful like CBD these actually you don't can't really taste it I'm surprised so now I'm just gonna go wash my hair dry it and get ready for bed and um I'll check back later I am back from my shower and I'm feeling chipper as a bird I feel awake and I don't know if that's because of the CBD coming or because of the shower that I just took but yeah I'm feeling way more awake and way better than I was and that's usually like the opposite of what I feel when I take CBD when I take CBD I'm usually like tired and like I don't want to say sluggish that's not really the word but um when I take CBD I usually just feel tired and ready for a nap and I feel pretty much the opposite which is great because I did learn recently but not all CBD makes you go to sleep again if you don't know this DVDs industry is largely unregulated so obviously you don't know what you are getting when you buy it which makes it really important to buy it from a reputable source um there are many out there but I really like trying new things so maybe sometimes I get like stuff that isn't great what is this Oh anyway so yeah um feeling pretty good feeling awake which is bad at this point like normally I'd be like ooh yeah I love being awake but I have to go to bed because I have to go to work tomorrow and it is now like 12:30 and um on the muscle front my armpit hair is growing back but you know what feeling pretty good um before I was just like I couldn't like lift my arm like above my shoulder and like it kind of still hurts like a little bit like it's sores not pain but it hurts to go like this but it's not like bad like I'm not like oh so yeah feeling feeling okay I don't know what else to say other than very effective yes so this is pretty much it it's just weird because like I'm so awake and this is definitely not a feeling that I'm used to having with taking CBD if that makes any sense so I'm just like woo but for right now I guess the only thing that I can do is try to go to bed and I know this is going to wear off in my sleep so I'm going to have to take the other one during the day to get me through my workday the other half I mean and um yeah so that's pretty much it so I guess now I'm just going to try to sleep and now it's also bothering me that like my video is two different colors because like the the white balance didn't kick in soon enough because I didn't want wait because I just want to go to bed um yes no non awkward way to end this so I'm just gonna go now and I will check back in in the morning to see how I feel and obviously like it's gonna be like pre other half of CBD coming so I'll see you later bye e hi everyone it is the morning after and I slept through the entire night I usually get up in the middle of the night to like pee but I didn't obviously because it took CET and I just slept today I feel great I have the most minimal minimal minimal soreness um and I do not feel like I rafted 14 miles yesterday like I feel good and like you know everything working order and everything is great so I was going to take the other half of the gummy this morning in case I still hurt but because I feel so good I'm just going to UM not take it so this was pretty much my first impressions of the brand of excuse me of this DVD got me that I tried and yeah I like it a lot I'm definitely gonna be by that friend again just because you don't really taste it at all and that's actually really impressive yeah and it's very effective as you can see so this is the end of my video thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time bye", "kXmXt-7ar98": "How we doing YouTube, my name is Dennis Morales and this is let's chat CBD Reviews and education I'll probably start posting educational content, too. But for now We'll be reviewing different types of products. And today we have CBDfx's mixed berry gummy bears boom For those of you that like gummy bears gas-station gummy bears are the best Walmart, gummy bears are the best don't at me Catch me on Twitter @Dennismorales13. If you really want to @ about my gummy bears, but if you don't Then stay away These gummy bears are where it's at I genuinely think that a broad spectrum Gluten-free non-GMO and overall vegan product is a totally solid way to go for anybody that is interested in getting the CBD in a more healthy holistic way Being that it's broad-spectrum broad-spectrum has a 0% THC. Can you see my about zero percent which means look I can take My daily serving of CBD chill myself out, catch a vibe at work because I'm probably stressed right? And when my boss comes in hey Dennis, you need a... You need a drug test. I'll be like, yeah, no problem I'm good because I take broad-spectrum CBD products that have 0% THC there are pros and cons to it overall But for anybody that does get drug tested regularly, I would recommend a product like this that is broad-spectrum 0% THC. I'm gonna say it as many times as possible So you guys get the point but my overall experience with again the mixed berry CBDfx gummies Was pretty solid I have been taking CBD for about two years now And I've been in and out of different products as you can tell I ate at all. So it was really good It wasn't overly sweet when I saw mixed berry. I got kind of nervous because I I don't really have like a big sweet tooth But with this product I genuinely enjoyed it. It wasn't too sweet. It wasn't in your face sweet like gas station gummy bears, although I love... I love gas station gummy bears I need to stop buying those But This product was a solid product and I would recommend it for anybody that has any interest in getting into CBD that doesn't want to smoke or consume tinctures Like I get it both sides of it. Smoking lately has been kind of a turn-off for people and tinctures, not everybody's cool with putting oil in their mouth I Totally understand that that being said these guys go at on their website for About $49.99 I believe. Yeah, $49.99. I'll double-check and add a caption in the video and It's pretty dope if you guys are interested in buying this product, there's gonna be a link below I am an affiliate of CBDfx.

review today on some CBD products sent to me by Dr Fischman labs they are by the brand of golden coat so I'm not sure if they're two different things but I was sent them and I'm going to review them so let's just jump into it all right so the first product I'm going to show you guys is the pain cream that they sent me it is a 350 milligrams CBD infused pain cream it has quite a few different things in it here is the packaging or like the bottle it comes in I'll probably have some closer up shots of it also so you can get a better view of it but it's pretty cool how its dispensed if you take off the top it has a roller right here which you'll just roll on your skin or wherever else you would want to use the cream so it kind of makes it a little bit less messy and easier to apply I would say so one of the main ways I've been using this pain cream is on my hands I do play quite a bit of video games I play on PC and I strain my hands quite a bit just pressing different buttons and stuff like that so I've noticed they tend to hurt after hours of gaming so I've started to use this cream on my hand and it tends to work fairly well I would say it's not gonna cure my hand problem I know I should just play less video games and that would probably do much better for me but since I don't this is a good safer way or more natural way that I can use to help bring down the pain I would say even though it's not the most pain but it's still something that's an annoyance while trying to concentrate on video games and you're just worrying about like oh this is like making my hand hurt a bit so it does help in that way and I like it and that's one of the biggest uses that I found one of the other ways I tend to use this cream is when I sit down in chairs I tend to sit crisscross applesauce and that can kind of cause some strain on my knees I just I don't know why I say like that it just feels like comfortable like while playing video games like I said before and just age I just like it and it just kind of hurts my knees a bit so I have been using this cream also a bit on that and it does help quite a bit with that so yeah if you have other pains and stuff like that I'm sure it worked just fine like I've shown the reason I'm using it on the most dire and I'm not being I'm not in the most amount of pain but it still works for them and I think it could work for some other things that you guys might have and need help with so that's what I like about it also there's a couple other things this cream doesn't leave like a nasty residue or anything like that it rolls on really easily you can rub it on with your other hand or just however you need to and there's not like a greasy residue to it it dries fairly quickly and you don't even really notice it's there besides the menthol effect to it and the menthol effects pretty nice it doesn't cool your wherever you use it it's it's a nice effect I mean it doesn't really add to the pain relieving but it kind of makes it feels good and it just kind of helps in that way I would say so yeah those are some things I like about it and things that I don't like I mean I haven't really found any yet it's just kind of like pain cream I mean the smell from it I mean it's really menthol II some people might not like that they might prefer something without a smell so that's kind of one thing that because some people could find it's a con but for me I've liked it so far and I would recommend it so for the second thing that I'm gonna be reviewing it is their gummies right here this is their 500 milligram set of gummies and they go all the way up to a thousand milligrams so I'll leave links to all these products down in the description so if you guys want to buy them you can just go find them right down there so these gummies they have worked quite well for me in some ways and not so well in other ways I would say the ways it worked best for me is sleeping if I take like two to the two of these like thirty minutes or 45 minutes before I want to go to sleep it does tend to really help me sleep help me calm down and just feel tired because that's one thing I have an issue with I just started for me to really wind down and get tired and these helped quite a bit with that other things that I was hoping it would help me for is my anxiety I do have quite a bit of like social anxiety and stuff like that and I was hoping that it might help me a bit with that but I didn't really notice any change from these gummies so that's just one other thing it didn't really help well with but the sleeping it did work quite well so I would recommend them for that there's probably a bunch of other uses these might work for but I haven't found one yet the flavours the flavors aren't bad I mean they are gonna still taste a little earthy like just like how CBD products taste I mean you it's kind of hard to get all of it out but these ones aren't bad at all I mean I want to eat too it's not like just eating like crappy medicine or something like that I mean you can taste that it's there but it goes down pretty easily they have a variety of flavors colors and stuff like that's I mean if there's certain ones that you don't prefer or whatever you can just eat the ones that you like and I mean you'd be wasting some but give them to a friend or whatever but yeah I do think these work quite well in helping me fall asleep other than that not really haven't fairly found much form yet so I think that's gonna be it for today's video thank you guys all for watching if you guys like the video it'd be great if you could go and like it and also leave me a subscription that would mean a lot I will be leaving all of the links to the products shown in the video down in the description below as well as

"quick update on my experience this past two days with a happy hemp gummies I will say I am very very very satisfied and I am a loving known I know it's only been two days but I've been doing the job so I've been using it for the past two days for menstrual cramps headaches muscle soreness and so I can sleep better so a quick little story yesterday I started getting really really bad cramps oh I get really really bad grams to the point where I can't do anything I just have to kind of squat down and put he and it's really bad and I've taken really strong medication sometimes they do something sometimes they know they don't I've gone to the doctor and it's just endless sometimes it's really bad so I decided to try something a little stronger and see if it would help more so yesterday I was working and I had a really bad cramp and I was like ah [ __ ] starting so I got up and I took one and within 5 to 10 minutes probably even less they were gone my friends were gone it was like do I even got cramps and I was able to work out perfectly fine I didn't get a cramp while I was working out but that it was quick usually it's not quick it's like excruciating pain so that was really good and then I've been really a store from the gym and I realized that it helped me kind of relax and feel better from being sore as well as the headaches that I get sometimes and being able to sleep or full night's sleep which is amazing this one's 1,500 milligrams which is stronger than what I was using before I was using a 750 CBD oil that one does help but sometimes when it like for example when my cramps really bad I had to take a lot more drops and it's really expensive so I didn't want to just waste it like that it sounds like I rather just got something stronger that I can just take one I take one you can take one two three every four to six hours it kind of just depends what you're using you for but I got mine off Groupon but I know they have an Instagram and they have a website so

bell scribe y'all know this if you ain't dipping dripping I'm out", "VeZ79z78neg": "hello so today I'm gonna talk about the Orange County CBD gummies absolutely love CBD gummy bears so I was really excited triose I've tried about eight different brands so far and I have to be honest with you this is my favorite one one of the first things you'll notice as well is they come with all different types of textures and if you can see but there's like a soft sugar coating to it also unlike some upper ones they do actually taste different each one my favorite is actually the blue one couldn\u00b4t table salt there is ten milligrams of board sectin CBD in each and every gummy bear they recommend between three to eight gummies meaning 30 to 80 milligrams of CBD per day depending on what you prefer um I like to have it first thing in the morning because I don't really want sugar before going to bed so I normally have a CBD oil before going to sleep and it got me first thing in the morning enough for highlight is these are actually vegan friendly so they contain no gelatin because is around forty pounds for the ten milligram CBD pack without actually know the exact number of gummy bears you get in here but I think it's about 50 so it's a lot more than usual tub you'd get with this kind of brands best-before has a nice long two-year date on it so I've had some sent to me where you've only got a month left on it Martin cannot express how nice these taste it's really hard not to have more than one that's all I hope you found that useful bye", "Ue5Kk_UsSbw": "[Music] hey guys it's Brandi with green wellness life I am here today to chat with you about a new line that we've decided to carry a cream on this life from koi that's koi like the fish koe they've got a pretty broad range of products including topicals lots of vapes tinctures as well and we've started by carrying just a few of the options to see when people think of them so this product line is new for us we would love to hear your feedback love to hear what you think they do have a few things going for them that are unique that that's one of the reasons that we decided to start carrying this product it's apparently Wild Kingdom day in my house today because I've got a cat fully distracted so here we go this is normal see people alright let's start with the tinctures we've chosen to carry the koi Naturals tinctures and orange flavor they also have a lemon line and then they also have a line that has not considered their natural so what makes it natural you say well they've not added any color into it and they're not using any artificial flavors so that is what makes its eligible to be in their Naturals line so we're carrying their t-shirt their orange t-shirt in two strengths a 500 and a thousand milligrams both of the bottles are gonna look like this little cutesy black frost and bottles and they've got the same ingredient list so they've got the full spectrum CBD natural orange extract and coconut oil so again a lot of our products do contain MCT or coconut oil as the base so that's something to be mindful of if you've got a coconut sensitivity definitely reach out if you want to to avoid that otherwise it's a great healthy oil to add into our bodies so one thing that is unique about koi and one reason we decided to carry out is that they utilize a process that manufactures a full spectrum oil with zero THC so you might have heard me talk about isolate before where the CBD compound is ice and added in to a product one they do the opposite they isolate the THC and yank it out so they're leaving him the rest of the full spectrum the plant matter and the other cannabinoids that are naturally occurring in hunt plants they leave it all there so that's pretty cool they've also figured out how to make it taste decent so with the tincture you're just gonna shake it up and then measure it out so we talked a lot unfortunately this one does not have a measurements on the pipette boo we wish that everybody did because boy wouldn't that make serving sizes a little easier and we talked in terms of full drops full droppers so when you press and release the bulb top here you can see I think you can see then that's really about three-quarters of the way full it's not all the way full but that's considered a full dropping your full dropper rather you're gonna get about forty of those out of each and B is one ounce bottles so on a 500 milligram we do that math handy-dandy calculator take 500 divide it by the forty servings at a full dropper pool which really looks like more like 3/4 you're gonna get about 12 and 1/2 milligrams of CBD so that is a reasonable middle of the road starting serving size if you find you want to step it up then you could always look at going to the thousand milligram because then you'd be getting more like 25 per dropper again zero THC otherwise full spectrum this is the orange mmm it smells in it taste it's actually really good they've done a nice job of adding a flavoring that compliment that hemp flavor and really controls it so the orange is really nice that is Charlie that is moseying around the table no worries we never actually eat at the dining room table it's strictly for show okay moving on we've also carried the koi gummies gummies have a little bit high price point per milligram of CBD we get a lot of requests for them and I was pretty Costin to carry them there was a company with a similar name to ours that was manufacturing some gummies that were not terrific and putting people on monthly reorder programs so we got a lot of calls for them when we were initially in business thankfully they have disappeared and we've had a lot of requests for gummies so we did decide to carry them I'm in my opinion a Gumby is a good booster I got occasional if you if you just need that quick boost of CBD it's not something I would include daily as a supplement the price points not great and then quite frankly it's a gummy so it's got all of the stuff in it that you would consider a gummy to be it does have gelatin so this is not a vegan product something to keep in mind does have artificial colors what they have done though in is that a lot of companies just kind of dust the CBD on the top and they actually use it all the way in the gummy so they believe that to be a better product I will tell you I have eaten a lot of gummies too many guys and these are actually really good so they taste good and I have noticed that if I'm struggling a bit in the day then they do give me the boost that I'm looking for so good product good occasional booster if you will to add into your daily regimen if you're looking for coming we're also carrying the Kois soft shoes the price point again on these is a little high it's higher than some of the other dog treats that we carry we're kind of talking about this for the picky pups so these are nice and soft and meaty they are pretty small two and a half milligrams of CBD per juice and you've got a big dog keep in mind that you'd be giving them a few of them but the dogs really like them kara that I work with she has a great day have a seat Lily oh good dog she has a Great Dane named Molly that will not touch any of our other pet products this is a serious dog snap not interested and she goes crazy for these helps if I show them so you got a picky eater that you're looking to add some meaty into their regimen this might be a good fit for you 25 choose about two point five milligrams of CBD per chew and they really like them Lily is enjoying hers camera right now okay then we move into the e-liquid quois got lots and lots of you liquids to choose from we chose two flavors and two strengths as a starting point something to keep in mind when you're buying a bottle a liquid which is what these are they're not in a cartridge form and they're not disposable these are bottles so keep in mind how many tanks you're going to be getting out of that bottle for example this is the koi a thousand milligram this is the blue the flavor of the blue I don't know if you can see that but it's blue raspberry and dragon fruit that is the flavor of this one this is a traditional a liquid in a bottle which means it does contain VG it does contain a PG so vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol if you're someone who's concerned about those ingredients and it's not something you would want to add they really like Italy everything smells plus I'm not usually home during the day so I think that it's an added benefit any you not really okay these do have VG and PG in them which means that you get that nice big smoke and a nice smooth vaping experience they taste wonderful but these are not the natural signs they do contain some artificial flavors they are a little stronger that as I was mentioning before I got distracted is you have to keep in mind how big new tank is and how many tanks you're gonna get out of it so the tanks that we carry and sell are just little guys these are a point 5 ml is the line where you're going to fill it up so this is a 30 ml bottle so you're gonna get sixty tanks so again if we grab our calculator and do our math this is a thousand milligram CBD bottle right so if we're gonna divide that if I get my calculator to work that'd be super so I was a milligram bottle we're gonna divide it but we're gonna see how many of the tanks we can get so we'll know how much our thousand is so we know 30ml bottle 0.5 milliliter tanks so that's gonna fill this little tiny tank that we carry 60 times so a thousand milligrams in a bottle divided by six seriously 16 so when we've got some of our high-strength cartridges that we carry from other manufacturers that are about 250 milligrams per tank this is going to be about 16 milligrams per tank so something to consider that it's not going to be nearly as strong with that set these do taste wonderful and they've ate really really nicely so if you're someone who really likes that traditional CBD vape no nicotine know th team wants it to taste delicious and sweet like candy then this is a good fit but if you're looking to stay away from VG or PG then I wouldn't go this route or if you're looking for something that's going to be really strong to me then this isn't going to be a great thing for you between this and my animals that apparently need all the screen time in the world I think that's where we are going to wrap it up we are here and available if you've got questions concerns anything that we can help you with that's what we're here for so our email is support at green wellness Life come again that support at Green Lomas life.com can always call us at eighty eight seven seven to seventy

call me down but you got to be careful if you eat one why cuz they're spooky spooky huh I'm just spooky right yeah I guess you'd shown yeah yeah that's so good and also so spooky spooktacular oh I already know how to say it they're just spooky they are good [Music]", "zrL0wlu_H-E": "so i had some requests to do a delta 8 gummy review and i definitely was not opposed to that so i decided to try out the 3g brand because that's one of the most common brands of delta eight that i've come across and there's a bunch of pretty solid reviews on there so let's check it out now i actually had to buy this one i didn't get an offering to do it for free but whatever wasn't too bad they're currently 25 off right now so we have here the gummies i got the watermelon flavor they have watermelon or black raspberry i'm just going to give you a quick breakdown try it out come back later let you know what's going on so i got the larger pack there's 32 servings in here serving size is half a gummy i really want to take two but just for the sake of trying it out for the first time and giving you guys a solid review i'm just gonna try one just so i don't get blasted out of my mind because i did see some pretty interesting reviews that even one gummy would do the job for a while before i do that let me first read the back and try to reenact my initial reaction so i turn it around and then i see right here can take up to four hours what to feel full effects that's not really a good actor but i don't know i've seen some of the reviews say it's just been one hour until they feel the effects i highly doubt it's gonna take four hours i did eat some food before this the ingredients i'll post them up on the screen it's basically just a bunch of sugar and hemp extract this feels like one big gelatinous blob i don't even know how these will separate but let's see oh these smell really good they are pretty separated it looks like so it's not that big jello blob i thought it was so let me try one out wow ooh damn it tastes like that old school bubble yum watermelon or whatever the brand was called let me just read a couple of these reviews that i'm looking at on their website here because i'm not going to get too too in-depth with anything with that because you can check it out for yourself i'll link it in the description and probably post some screenshots here too so the first one that got me anonymous may 11th 2020 eat a handful and you will literally be tripping i doubt i'll be fully tripping but i don't know maybe a handful would uh you know definitely do something i don't want to quite need a handful yet maybe at a later date um just to you know cost effectiveness and everything let's see here anonymous may 11th they are tasty great consistency i wish they weren't out of stock all the time that's partially why i jumped on buying these because apparently they're out of stock a lot and for some reason my new phone is freezing when i'm going onto the site so whatever so overall taste is great i'll be back in a while hopefully not four hours and i'll let you know what's going on and then i'll probably based on what i'm feeling have another one so we'll see see you in a bit these are [ __ ] great it's about 6 30 p.m now i took the first one at i think it was around noon so i rode my bike down to the park i usually do this and it wasn't too cold out so i ended up for just a couple hours really a mix of working out stretching riding my bike whatever and then as this stuff continues to just you know kick in it was it was awesome so absolutely perfect especially if you if you've ever you know when you kind of just get in that groove of either working out or stretching or whatever and then everything just feels phenomenal and i just look like a weirdo doing all these weird stretches in the park and whatever so i'm back now i took a shower and like i said it's around 6 30. it definitely would i feel like this feeling would definitely just kind of last feel like it's leveled off and now it's kind of slowly calming down and i feel like this would last this still uh like the euphoric very nice just both uh both body high and then just mental high of just feeling just really nice really relaxed and it's fantastic so i'm sure the vast majority of you know exactly what i'm talking about so these are 100 worth it based on what the price is and then having 16 in here and mind you the serving size is one half gummy and i just took one full i would never suggest just going outside of the full dosage the first time you try it because everyone's tolerance is different but with that said i'm just gonna have one more and i'll be back tomorrow to let you know i assume it's just going to add on to the current effects spike them up again and whatever so i'm just going to enjoy the rest of my evening have this and i'll be back tomorrow morning and let you know what's up the next day wow i absolutely love these so the second gummy as the other one i said was kind of just wearing off after several hours the next one definitely i'd say started to kick in but is the way i experienced it is that that leveling off just kind of built up again and i went to sleep and say maybe around 11 o'clock and i was definitely feeling it for sure no signs of that slowing down or anything i slept great i woke up today i'm still pretty early i've been getting up pretty early even on the weekends and i noticed maybe the slightest bit of grogginess but it wasn't anything that you know made me sleep in for a long time or feel uh bad or impact me negatively or anything but all i contribute that to was just the fact that i had two of them and then the last one i think was around six or seven pm and uh yeah so it wasn't really even a bad thing at all i just wanted to mention that little aspect and that kind of occurred the first time i tried a delta 8 anyway after not having any sort of thc for several months but if you were looking for a gummy delta a thc whatever a good substitute to delta 9 thc and especially if you are trying to find something that's not smokable and edible this is a hundred percent awesome i love this and as with the other uh tinctures and everything but this one was very familiar to the erita hemp tincture that i still need to post a review on but maybe by the time you're watching this video that's already up so check that out but these were very intense very similar to even having a delta nine edible but it was still no sort of paranoia or anxiety or any anxiety or anything i know people mentioned the paranoia and anxiety can be a bit less on delta eight which is you know i find that to be true but even throughout years of smoking or eating whatever delta nine i feel like the anxiety and the paranoia that one can experience with that just in my experience just in my personal opinion it really all depends on your mindset beforehand because i've known that in times of my life when i was when i had much more much higher levels of anxiety in general and you know whether it be anxiety depression whatever other lifestyle factors things that have been going on in my life at the time that the majority of time that i would smoke pot or delta nine my anxiety levels chances are i would my anxiety level levels would go up exponentially when i would smoke until i'd have to actively just force myself to calm down really and just relax and enjoy it and then other times i would have it frequently and that did not occur at all so i feel like a lot of it has to do with your mindset but once again you know thc the endocannabinoid system and everything it's all going to be entirely different from person to person the way they feel the effects as is with these gummies or certain delta a cartridges or certain types of bud whatever the way i experience these gummies here could be totally different for you depending on where you're at in your life your own genetics a bunch of other things but me personally awesome so if you are into this type of stuff which you probably are if you're watching this video and you've been curious what these three chee gummies were like that's how they were for me so i'll put a link in the description below if you want to check out their main website i'm not affiliated with affiliated with them at all but hey if you want a business partner

"hey guys just wanted to say one quick thing on CBD hemp CBD dummies edibles choose ours are called hemp freak shoes Liberty brand hemp these are ours this is my company before you buy a CBD gummy what you want to look for this is important and not a lot of companies do this you want a full spectrum product so you want the the CBD that goes into making them that input material you gotta want full spectrum taking a CBD orally in edible form works for a lot of people it's not the absolute best way to take CBD so if you're gonna do it make sure you do it right we always tell everyone to you know chew up the gummy and let it sit under the tongue for 30 seconds before you swallow that's actually a really good tip but you definitely want to make sure they're full spectrum they gotta be full spectrum if they're not you just you know you're you're selling yourself short a lot of what's out there is an isolate sometimes they'll use a distillate in the material most of its isolate based ours

that's Wednesday I'm May 13th 2020 oh yeah Benny wagon um a few days ago I got a package in the mail from koi CBD they sent me some stuff you know basically for free but you know this isn't a sponsored review or anything you know these are all my opinions no just saying but anyway I haven't had this kind before of the CBD gummy so does one do a video of them you know I'm betting why I forgot to mention in my last video of the normal like koi CBD gums the tropical fruit ones you know the six-pack like with the one that comes with six guns of my local smoke shop is $11 but the bag I had yesterday had 20 guns so gnarly for sure how much the price would be probably a little bit expensive but you want to mean you know from the amount of gummies though you get and because they work good to you you know I think it's worth it you know just saying anyway I haven't had this flavor before but they also have this and a six pack on my local smoke shop I didn't get this one before but you know you know since they sent me them for free though you know I'm just gonna try them anyway you know just saying anyway today I'm gonna be reviewing the sour tropical fruit Koya CBD even gummies

koi standard WWE Naturals calm so Facebook Instagram Twitter and YouTube logos so you know canon comes with the red green and orange from gumminess basically I'm gonna take half a bite of each gum and it has you know the sour powder on them the normal ones didn't have that sour powder so see you know anyway I might have forgot a napkin or something these are a little bit greasy and sticky anyway first one I'm gonna try is the red one and they say coy on them you know but yeah anyway well these ones are like really soft we're competitive the normal ones they're not really as chewy or gummy you know I was just gonna eat half of them each of them when he ate that one full but I'm just gonna half of this one why [Music] well the cherry one was sweet was a little sour though but tasted most of the same as the original cherry one lime one yeah I definitely liked their original wine one better than one sour line one has basically the same lime flavor but um you know lime is not really like one of my favorite flavors you know anyway no one made it a little bit more sour a little bit like nasty or tasting so you know wasn't really as good as the original my mum here's the orange one I didn't get to review the orange one on camera of the original kind but it's my favorite kind of these gummies so this one's probably really lit you know just saying also they don't really smell you know maybe a teeny bit but um can't really probably smell anything off these gummies see what I mean anyway here goes [Music] sweet but also sour basically has the same orange flavor so normal gummy just a little bit sour you know it's also a little bit worse than the normal the only one these gummies that I like to um was the cherry one actually I like it about the same as the normal cherry one but the cherry normal one's a little bit better though I like I'm about the same though but I think up or heard the cherry one best of these sour gummies so you know what I mean but you know they're so pretty what you know and they'll help you get unlit I guess you know they may help with pain relief and anxiety relief and stuff so you know I already had a few of these normal kind of guns they definitely helped me and get a little bit of pain relief they help you sleep better at night you know and also yeah they definitely help to like relieve some anxiety and sub 2 and pain relief yeah I think they're pretty lit um they definitely work better in those one extreme um CBD come inside oh god the gas station like about a month and a half ago and then make a video on them though but I put a picture on my Instagram stories on these will definitely way better than those and those were like way more expensive you know for only like five gummies it was like almost $25 you know that was like a bad idea for me to get those in wasting my money I guess yeah but these though these though definitely work better though but I'm I still think my favorite CB product is the hem bomb CBD pills those ones work like the best for me anyway so you know these those really help calm me down you know help me feel good you know just saying yeah these are still pretty good though you know like the normal ones a little bit more and means these are still pretty good though so I probably get the sour tropical quite the CBD gummies um I'd probably give these like an 8 out of 10 you know just saying they're so pretty good but um I like the normal ones better in the sour ones you know still pretty good though so you should definitely try them you know just saying yeah I don't know the price of these but on my local smoke shop a six-pack is like um 11 dollars you know so this would probably be more not you know I'm just saying yeah I definitely try them nothing fun they're actually still pretty good so yeah I got an 8 out of 10 I'll try to do some more CBD videos soon steer more videos for watching see you guys later peace out and bye", "5hsCZVvIsbU": "all right what's up everybody your main homie EDF India's bringing you guys a little review of wild edibles now these are a delicious way of consuming cannabis or the consistency to match so finding your perfect dosage is honestly really easy my favorite is about thirty milligrams or three pieces which I personally found was the perfect high before you start hitting that area where you start getting anxiety here and there you know ten milligrams was also a very comfortable micro dose amount it was a really easy high and you weren't really gone you were just chilling having a good time the packaging was a fun experience honestly I really had a good time just opening it up for twenty dollars for a hundred milligrams this is like your average price and honestly it's a really good flavor it's consistent and it's really potent which make it worth trying but it honestly is just another edible on the market there's nothing so special where it's like oh man I'm gonna keep coming back but honestly it really is a great

zero THC per package per package yeah the one thing that you will need to keep in mind is this funky farms doesn't like give you all of everything like all of their reports and I'm not sure if it's just because it's an isolate or if it's just the way that they are they do show you your certificate of analysis so you know you definitely get 50 milligrams inside the package or five companies with ten each but you don't know everything about the plant like some other companies might they show you the microbial reports and the residual solvent reports and things like that we don't get that with this one so this product of ID's sugar and corn syrup so you get about 20 calories per little gummy and the product is manufactured in a place where Trina's and soy is processed just for those of you that have allergies are aware it is $10 so it's pretty cheap it's like 10 bucks or two bucks a gummy to go around the gummy we're down to our last one and I mean I'd like to so you could share it maybe cuz 2 & 2 this was five so we need to share it marriage is Shari yeah you all know about that what's hers is hers and what's mine is hers yeah that's usually about the way it goes I don't give birth to two of your children so I deserve a half a gummy and my right ladies we love the funky forums guys enjoy the guys they do taste well and they don't leave a weird aftertaste which some of them do mm-hmm for two dollars a gummy that's not a bad rice that's kind of doughy market right oh yeah and it's if you're kind of new to supplementing with CBD these are a fun way to get into it do keep in mind though that you see that I had to stop to make sure he only took half do keep in mind that you get five of them and when you take your CBD by gummy it's gonna take a little bit longer to get into your system than you then it would say if you were taking a tincture or if you were smoking abate now it's my turn are you done chewing so that you can talk I might I might continue to talk so the other thing that I really like about the product is the fact that it is when I was like one with that sweet and also a little bit sour yep it is a little sour kick to it but it's not bad it tastes really well and like I said in video it doesn't have a weird aftertaste some of them do know that we took really good babe yeah they do taste really good I think I said that you said taste really well oh sorry for all those English people out there I apologize which one's right guys does it taste really good it tastes really well I'm pretty sure it tastes really good okay well never know well we'll have to wait for other people comment below to comment below and tell us oh yeah I can subscribe our channel if you want to do another now back to funky falling on the back there's three different flavors and they've got watermelon tropical fruit and great and this one is much like favorite flavored favorite that I have received we got a box of these from the company because they were wanting to know we would carry some of these particular gummies in the studio drive temp store and so I was very thankful that they sent it to us and we've loved it we've enjoyed it and the jury is not out anymore we know it I think I'm going to be starting to carry the watermelon I preferred the watermelon over the tropical to be honest I'm topical oh you better get over there because there's just a couple left no so we're taking that of course so I do have other funky Farms products we're going to review so definitely subscribe to our channel to stay up to date with all of the best and hopefully

couple of products from industrial hemp farms these guys contacted me and sent me a little care package to uh try their stuff so i wanted to give them an honest review after them uh supplying me with some of their product first thing we'll get into is the cbd hemp flower they sent me some of the banana kush and uh i couldn't find any info on this specific strain as far as how much cbd is in here but i will go into the effects and the look and all that uh the look on this bud is actually pretty impressive for a cbd flower uh it had a good structure to it good amount of density and it was a decent sized nug i only got one gram but it was basically just the one nugget you won't see any trichomes on this because there's not any thc in this bud so you're not going to see too many trichomes but overall decent looking stuff for a hemp flower now on the effects on this stuff it basically to me it relaxes me a bunch like it'll really relax you but you won't have any sort of intoxicating effects and i think that's the main goal with cbd i think ideal uses for this stuff would be uh if you're in a job that gets drug tested and you still want to like simulate smoking weed this stuff definitely will achieve that i think it's good for if you're trying to conserve your stash you can maybe like roll a half j with some really good flour and then half with this just to kind of supplement it if you don't want to supplement with like tobacco or something like that so i think is really really useful in those aspects and it's very very affordable stuff so if you're interested in the cbd hemp flower they did supply me with an affiliate link so if you want to buy some definitely go through my link in the description and check out the cbd hemp flower they also did give me some of the cbd gummies i'm not huge on edibles i did consume some of these i didn't feel too much from them but i don't think you're really supposed to i gave uh some to my wife and she did remark that they did help her sleep uh very very well and one thing i wanted to remark these things tasted amazing they tasted really really good the cherry one especially i mean it tasted better than most gummies that you buy just for taste so i was very very impressed uh with their cbd gummies there so like i said if you're interested in any of the industrial hemp farm products i have a link in the

everybody welcome back to my channel I'm ray thank you guys so much for watching in today's video we're gonna talk about something very very very interesting CVD but before we do I want you to subscribe to this channel first and also follow me on instagram ari why underscore mmm DL my Instagram page got hacked and I'm trying to build my following again so make sure you do that and now let's get right into the video so before we start talking about the CBD part I just want you to give you a background story of how like everything happened or how everything started so for about nine ten years now I've been like depending on coffee like crazy it got to the point where I was drinking coffee like way more than I was drinking water it was the only thing that I would drink that would allow me pretty much to get out of bed every single day every single morning and for me to focus on what I had to do it got to the point where I was drinking it so much that I'd know sort of like effect on me whatsoever so I would like still drink it but still feel sleepy and I was very anxious like all the time I was agitated super super impatient I didn't have no sort of like appetite whatsoever I was losing mad weight it got to the point where I got so so so skinny reduce my anxiety problems I started you know looking for things that I could take in order for me to be more relaxed and feel like a normal person all over again and there is wheat you know like people smoked but I honestly cannot stand the smell we'd and so that's when I discovered CBE I've tried other brands but the one that I'm gonna talk about right now is took it to a whole nother level lasting like a huge difference in my skin and then my mood and everything pretty much so now talking about CBD if you don't know what CBD or haven't heard about CBD I don't know like where have you been living it's been training everywhere for the past few years I think and if you don't know where CBD is CBD is a component of the cannabis plant however it has no THC whatsoever in it it has pretty much all the benefits of medical marijuana without the intoxicating effect and it helps a lot with insomnia pain and also anxiety which the brand that I'm actually gonna talk about is sugar and cush and the reason why I feel like I've been using this one is because everything is so yummy and they have like different alternatives so they have the cookies and the cookies has its gluten free dairy free 100% vegan it's all-natural you also have like the gummy bears and the gummy bears are honestly like one of my face like they taste they taste so good and in one bottle you have 30 gummies and you have also the CBD oils so the ones that I've got or cotton candy cotton candy and vanilla they taste so good so what I like about these is the fact that you have like different alternatives so so the way I do it every single day I would take one in the morning and one at night and I like the fact that they different alternatives so I can take one gummy in the morning and then take the CBD oil at night or even one cookie depending on how I feel and I would definitely recommend you to take one before like starting a stressful activity and usually whenever I take these I will start filling it after like let's say 25 to 30 minutes whenever I take it I feel like such a huge sense of like calmness and I focused so much better on my stuff it's like I'm easygoing and for some reason whenever I take the CBD or I feel like it acts faster so let me show you so this is the vanilla and candy my favorite one is that peanut head but the cotton candy you have 500 milligram CBD all in this bottle right here so the way I'll take it I was literally drop it on my tongue and then let it sit for like 10 seconds and then swallow with so let me show you you can actually add the CBD oil like in your food in your drinks depending on what you prefer I would say but I like to put it on my tongue and just I like to taste the oil I feel like and the gummy bears as well then I already ate one this morning but I'm just gonna eat it actually just for you guys down so you have like colorful gummy bears each one of them taste different it's chewy and doesn't it doesn't stick to your teeth at all you have the cookies I haven't tried the cookies yet let me try it so this is one of their cookies right here so you have 8 cookies in one pad and it's amazing oh my god well what I like the most about on sugar and push yourself but whenever you go on their website they have like a specific tab not like literally a whole list a whole report of each and every ingredient added into these products I would definitely recommend you taking CVD if you have problem with insomnia pain or anxiety especially on sugar and cush is definitely my go-to I'm the chip using it now and I'm probably gonna keep using it I mean they have different flavors I know that for the CBD or I only shows you the vanilla and cotton candy but they have so many other flavors that you can actually go on the website and check it out hey I just want you to know guys that all my reviews are honest I don't care how much I'm getting paid I would never lie just for me to get paid and when the products is pretty much cheap I just feel like it's supported for everybody to feel good in their own body so this has helped me and I hope that

"d7HcVsPa_hk": "[Music] welcome back to the channel in this video we're talking all about Nirvana CBD and why it's by far the best brand that I've ever dealt with or tried okay welcome to the channel if you're new here and like what you see consider subscribing and before we get any further I do want to say a huge thank you to Nirvana for sponsoring this video the only reason I accepted this and went through with the sponsorship is because I absolutely love these products and I will break down why the first time I ever tried CBD I was at a vapor expo in California and a friend of mine Louis when I was down there with hometown hero he and I both tried it and we got rocked like three sheets to the wind completely high there's no other way to explain it we were high I used to smoke weed a lot so I know what that feels like and we were high and then so from there I was very reluctant and hesitant understandably to to try CBD again there was a reason I quit smoking weed and stopped getting high and I did not like feeling like that in that setting and you know it was a big surprise and it was just really terrible I did not like it that's forward I've been getting a lot of a lot of emails from a lot of different CBD companies asking if I will review their products and because of that experience I had and then because of the lack of regulation in the industry and some of the shadiness that I see I'm very skeptical about CBD it's a supplement right and like other supplements even the ones that like health stores like GNC like I don't know I don't know if what they're saying is in the bottle is actually in the bottle and at what amounts and dosing was always kind of weird to me because I always saw like you know tinters and and all kinds of stuff and it was never really clear on like how to dose and and for me here's what I'm dealing with I get migraines frequently I've got neck issues knee issues and I'm just getting older you know I'm just getting older so I've got kind of you know aches and pains and and some other things and I eat ibuprofen by the handful all day long and so I've been really looking for something to help take that pain away and not to mention just deal with my general anxiety that I have a really bad anxiety keeps me up at night and Nirvana has come in and really just kind of blown my mind CBD in general and if you guys would like me to cover CBD and kind of break it down what is it where does it come from the different types in a separate video let me know in the comments I've been doing a little bit of research I think I want to tackle that topic so if you're interested in that please let me know but CBD comes in a lot of different forms and some varieties so there's isolate broad spectrum and full spectrum all of Nirvana's products are broad spectrum and in my opinion that's the good stuff like that's where it's at now unfortunately because of the way YouTube is I'm not going to show you using this product because I think that might be against their Terms of Service I don't really know I really do not want to get a strike on my channel but what I can say is that I've been using these products for about a month now and I love them let me show you some of the varieties they offer and then I'll talk more about about the different products CBD isn't like a cure-all there's definitely a lot of research that needs to be done and all I can talk about is my personal experience and anecdotal evidence and experience that I've I've seen from other people CBD comes in a variety of different forms and the form you choose will really depend on what your end goal is so for me personally for like topical stuff like my knees for some reason I'm having pain in my hand kind of feels like arthritis I'll use something like the CBD roll-on which is awesome so this is like an oil that you roll on and then rub in or one of the lotions and I love these on mine on my back on my neck and they have a muscle recovery lotion which is great for like after the gym for me personally it helps with soreness and any kind of aches and pains for anxiety things like that you're probably going to want something more internal and same with sleep so for sleep they have the excellent melatonin one right here and this has melatonin in it and the CBD alone so even if you just did the natural one the CBD by itself helps me sleep and helps me stay asleep which is key and so I like the capsules for that they also have gummies and twenty gummies at 500 milligrams so what I love about Nirvana CBD products as you can see right here 20 gummies by 25 milligrams per gummy equals 500 milligrams of CBD other gummies aren't as detailed as far as what's in what you're getting and this just makes dosing a lot easier dosage recommendation was big for me too because I didn't know where to start and I didn't want to feel like I was getting getting any kind of head change which most people say you won't but I definitely get a little bit of a head change if I take too much of really good CBD this has zero THC in it some CBDs will so make sure you you check the label and if you don't want any THC like me I don't want any THC at all broad-spectrum is the way to go for me because of the zero THC CBD legally can have up to like point zero 3 or 0.3% of it I think something like that but there's a very trace amount in some CBD allowed by loft make sure you check the label and know what you're getting into if you don't want CBD or if you don't want THC as you can see here we Jess and I really like these gummies she's primarily been been going to town and these gummies she'll take one before bed helps her stay asleep a note about the gummies they are delicious without like any kind of weird flavor they're just really edible you can see yeah they're definitely like a little they have some residue in there but one thing I've noticed about these gummies is that they're just quality they're built well they don't have a bunch of extra sugar and stuff on them and yet they still taste delicious and they're still really effective one of the big reasons that I stay away from most brands is because of the dosing and with with Nirvana it makes it extremely easy to dose even if you're gonna do at inter right you because the bottles have this really fantastic dropper that outlines the milliliters so you can figure it out and dose exactly what you want and at that point for me like this is more this is definitely like a medication I treat it like a medication and I want to be precise with that and this brand allows me to do that which I love so not only is it extremely high quality stuff they have amazing flavors for the Tincher peppermint vanilla strawberry grapefruit and all of these are extremely high quality you know what you're getting you know it's good stuff that's why I'm such a huge fan of this brand now premium brands are going to be more expensive and Nirvana is no exception in my opinion I'd much rather spend more for quality stuff that has in it what it says is in it so if it says 500 milligrams that's what I'm getting rather than paying you know cheap prices for some cheap cheap CBD that could be god-knows-what or maybe not have as much as it says it does and I just don't want to have to worry for me this is one of those things that paying the extra money really pays off this Nirvana CBD has helped me sleep better have less anxiety it's helped me stop taking as much ibuprofen as I do really awesome because I don't know what God knows what that's doing to my stomach and it just works it just works roll-on oil is fantastic for my hand that started hurting all of a sudden I just roll it on both sides and rub it in a one word of caution like I have small kittens small children so I don't use any of the lotions or the oil roll ons and then go play with them because I don't want it to contact them and get on them so if it's going to be during the day I'll just take a capsule know exactly what I'm getting the exact dose its repeatable its precise I can't say enough good things about this brand I love the product and I'm a believer in CBD if you haven't tried it yet I would highly recommend trying it and if you don't want any kind of head change like I didn't start at a low dose starts small and work your way up I started with 0.25 milliliter dose for the first couple couple nights and then worked my way up to the recommended dose overall I highly recommend nirvana if you're in the market for CBD I will have them linked in the description

CBD and gummy bears right there's 30 in this packet there's 10 milligrams of CBD oil in each one and about 24 quid I think if you want to get a hold of some I'll put the link to buy them in the description or in the comments or something like that but yeah I've never a CVD before I've heard a lot of people talk about the health benefits of it especially long term health benefits of it if you've got anxiety or some sort of pain yin and it good for pain relief and all that and you may not take it every day but I've also heard about short term effects of it some people are saying that if you eat CBD oil or ingest it in whether it's an oil form vapor or whatever that we've in like an hour where you feel like chilled out relaxed you know anxiety goes and things like that so that's what I'm going to find out today I'm gonna eat two of these so that's 20 milligrams of the oil right let's give this a go I've been told I have to chew them up properly before I swallow them I don't know what they're gonna taste like it tastes pretty good I'll definitely feeling something 100% I'll feeling more relaxed my eyes are feeling a bit heavy about five minutes a girl caught myself saw just staring into space now I'll do that quite a lot anyway because I'm proper lazy if I'm honest I'm always daydreaming and that but I was in the middle of doing something and yeah I just saw caught myself drifting away from it and just literally staring into space being about two hours time I'm supposed to be gone out a couple of drinks but right now I'm thinking a copy positive that I just want to sort of like relax and do nothing maybe I took them at the wrong time a day maybe I should have taken him like half an hour before I was ready to go to bed but either way I know that I know that they are giving me an effect so I'm gonna have to it day now for the next fourteen days just before bed and when the tubs finished I'll come back to you with a little follow-up video and let you know sort of the more long-term effects or sort of Abbot's hours help me sleep basically and whether I feeling any different within myself plan if you can hear on that mic there's a cat outside that sounds like he's wrestling for guinea pigs and losing quite badly but all in all though fit needs are worth taking a look at if anybody's had any experience with either DS or CBD oil and gym ball whether it's vaping or the oil itself or whatever let me know in the comments had any effect on you short-term or long-term or is it done nothing at all [Music] you", "woybDqonW5E": "I'm having issues with my hair so sorry I was over here trying to do stuff with it and like nothing I can't get it to stay anyway I want it to so and it's getting on my nerves so yeah I need to straighten that anyway so want to let you guys know about the CBD stuff okay so it works it doesn't work like smoking weed it doesn't work like THC you know so it's a different effect but I feel it and what I mean by that is it isn't like some kind of chemical weirdness or whatever it is actually where I feel calm it's like a subtle calm and it's like my my brain like my thoughts and stuff like are very calm it's like all of the overthinking all the racing thoughts all of that has gone away I even went to Chipotle like thirty minutes ago and it was busy as heck the lines were wrapped around my passed the door all that stuff and usually when I go into Chipotle and it's like that or any time really I started getting anxiety and I start freaking out I'm like hurry I want to hurry and get out of there you know as fast as I can and this time it didn't affect me I stayed in line everything and it was perfectly fine so what I'm saying is this the CBD sorry the CVD works amazingly well so it just calms you and like all my symptoms of anxiety and stuff are like they went away too and so I'm hoping I really need to get my hair on my face no uh so what I'm saying is I would definitely do see video oil I was asked in the last video with the different okay CBD oil first of all is an all-natural product I am NOT against I'm against man-made medication I'm against prescription drugs things like that of that nature you know I am NOT against all natural stuff that's how I heal I'm an all natural healer that's what I'm used to that's what I do even with my kids wait I don't vaccinate my kids first of all and we're not gonna go on to that I'm not gonna get into some kind debate with you guys but I don't fascinate my kids everything we do healing wise is 100% natural my kids have had the flu before and I feel them naturally I don't there's no medication no antibiotics under that crap so that's what I mean like using natural stuff from the earth and so we need help is actually all natural cannabis is all natural so I don't feel I feel like that's amazing and CBD oil is a form it's a chemical taken from the marijuana plant but it's not THC that's gonna get you like all high and crazy right so there's actually see whatever dude I don't know I'm just trying to tell you guys I love how it's making me feel I do feel more focused and I do feel like I can more normal more down-to-earth more grounded and more the anxiety isn't affecting me and all that so I am loving this like I really and truly am and so I believe this is just my opinion that you guys should try and I just did a 25 milligram gummy that's all I did and so and I like it I really I really enjoyed this I'm really enjoying this like I'm probably gonna go back and get more because I like how it's making me feel so without the high and it's legal so yeah you anyway but I will talk to you guys I just want to let you guys know how this how it affected me and I will keep in touch and I will be making more videos I promise and yeah just take care of the amazing stay awesome and stay positive and don't let anybody bring you down I'm probably gonna be doing a video about that here soon so maybe tonight who knows because I know I feel but anyway I'll talk to you guys later I am more focused and zero anxiety so let's plug anyway love you guys remember you're not alone and you know mess with my hair thank you", "gtki1MEVt04": "hey guys chance here at the middle of fix a Belmont today I just wanted to quickly go over a product that we've had for about a month now but I've been using them personally and I just want to kind of give my personal opinion on the on then I don't think I've ever made a video specifically on this product I know I talked about the funky Farms display if CBD display we have next to the register up there but I want to talk about specifically the CBD gummies from funky farms they're really good so there's three flavors that we carry you have the tropical tropical fruit flavor you have watermelon and you have grape they are 50 milligrams there's five in them so there are 10 milligrams apiece one gummy is a serving size so honestly they can last you a good while you know uptaken last you five days if you only take one a day they are really good I like all the flavors I've tried I've been doing one of each for since pretty much since we got them but honestly I say watermelons problem my favorite great is gonna be a close second I can't quite figure out which one I like best but I do believe I like the watermelon a little bit more than the grape and tropical fruits pretty good as well I still do tropical fruit but out of the three it's probably my least favorite out of them too the other the other two rather say but yeah so there are five in these there are none in the $9.99 apiece per per 5-pack I mean it's not up not per one you know um but yeah they're really good they are surprisingly tasty you know you try to get these some of these gummies and you know you just taste too much of the CBD and stuff but with these you don't get a lot of that you get all the CBD you need for them but the flavor is still there and it's still delicious funky farms makes great stuff anyway I'm sure you guys have tried some funky farms cartridges and stuff like that but all-in-all I definitely recommend them great price for what you're getting five gummies for ten dollars you can't really beat that especially when we have like weekend sales for CBD you can even get them even cheaper you know depending the weekend sellers that Tom for CBD but that's all for today guys don't forget like I'm scrub swing by pick you up some CBD funky farm two gummies and we'll see you when you get here peace", "Muy2sCxD5qg": "well I'm a believer I tried seaweedy for the first time and let me tell you it does everything that they claimed that it does now I have a friend who is an affiliate and she sells CBD oils and I listened to what she had to say but I never really bought into it so it was out of my price range for something that probably would not work so I went to the gas station and they were selling a bunch of CBD stuff and they had this little thing CBD gummies and you know there's five of them in a pack and they're not that expensive like at all so why not it's gummies they can be delicious whatever so I decided to give them a try and the reason I tried to give them a try is I have horrible back pain horrible like degenerative disc disease horrible and sometimes it's crippling and I just I don't like taking pain pills I don't like taking a fistful of Tylenol every couple hours I don't like taking a couple naproxen I don't like taking advil I don't like taking the elite I don't like prescription pain pills they just eventually don't work for me they might work for you which is whatever but I tried these I only ate one only ate one and almost instantly my back's doctor and almost instantly took like probably like 12 minutes five minutes something like that but was almost instantly and it was like holy [ __ ] this is a miracle it's I took one they gave me the same amount of relief that to naproxen eight tylenols you know that a fistful of medications would take only one it only took one and it's been about 30 hours right now and my back still feels pretty good and I've only eaten one so I'm a believer and if you don't believe me do like I did and go and get you a little small pack out of gas station they're sold everywhere now so they're pretty easy to find and give it a try you might be out like 10 bucks if it doesn't work for you or you could be like me and you be completely astounded that something so small worked and it wasn't even doctor prescribed it was just word of mouth so believe the hype people get you some CBD for for some pain relief for some stress for anything that they say that it works for I promise you it works it works for me and I mean look at these you're not not a bad-sized gummy you know it's normal size giving me and the taste they taste phenomenal but then there's an aftertaste kind of like a little aftertaste whatever it's not bad it's not horrible it's not unbearable mmm but there you have it just try it I'm a believer I'm a believer you should be a believer get you some CBD and if you don't know it CBD is that's cannabis oil hemp oil there's no THC in it it's not a drug it's pretty pretty normal nowadays see sizzle oh no no no teach-in yeah you probably can't see it because it's [ __ ] tiny but there's no THC in it it's it's not bad give it a try and you'll be surprised at how well it works well whatever they're telling you it works work is it [ __ ] works", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video

BEEN STIRRING UP CONTROVERSY.  IT'S CALLED C-B-D... AND SOME CLAIM IT HAS  MEDICAL PROPERTIES...  9 ON YOUR SIDE'S KARA GANN IS DIGGING DEEPER TONIGHT, INTO THE PRODUCTS MADE  WITH C-B-D.  PRODUCTS WITH CBD  INSIDE HAVE BEEN POPPING UP EVERYWHERE, RAISING  THE QUESTION \"WHAT IS  CBD?\" SO WE TOOK THOSE QUESTIONS TO EXPERTS TO FIND OUT .  YOU CAN FIND CBD IN  JUST ABOUT ANY FORM..  OILS, SOAPS, LOTIONS,  CREAMS, BATH BOMBS,  EVEN FOOD. CBD OR SCIENTIFICALLY  CALLED \"CANNABIDIAL\" IS  ONE OF MANY  CANNABINOIDS IN THE  HEMP PLANT.  THESE PRODUCTS RECENTLY MADE THEIR  WAY ONTO STORE SHELVES AFTER  PRESIDENT TRUMP  SIGNED THE \"2018 FARM  BILL\" INTO EFFECT LAST DECEMBER.  THE BILL ULTIMATELY  ALLOWS HEMP TO BE  GROWN AS AN  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. BUT WHAT IS CBD AND IS IT SAFE? WE ASKED DR KEN SODERSTROM, AN ASSOICATE PROFESSOR  WITH THE DEPARTMENT  OF PHARMACOLOGY AND  TOXICOLOGY AT ECU'S  BRODY SCHOOL OF  MEDICINE.  \"it is a drug and like any drug it is potentially toxic and so it is something to be careful about.\"  \"the most typical way of administering CBD is by  troche in oil under the  tongue.\" BUT CAN CBD GET YOU \"HIGH\" LIKE  SMOKING MARIJUANA? \"cannibidiol will not get you  high but other things that come along with it as the oils extracted may get you high and the principal among  those is delta 9 thc.\" THC IS  THE PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOID IN THE CANNIBIS PLANT...  WHICH IN LARGE AMOUNTS IS ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL AND  MOST STATE LAWS. SO DO THESE CBD  PRODUCTS HAVE THC  INSIDE? \"...it will have some thc yes.\" CONSUMER  GRADE CBD PRODUCTS DO CONTAIN .3 PERCENT  OF THC.. HOWEVER SODERSTROM SAYS THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO QUOTE ON QUOTE \"GET YOU HIGH\" \"it may have just a trace but it will always have some  measurable amount of cannabinoids that are  psychoactive.\" THE NEXT  QUESTION MANY ARENT  SURE ABOUT IS WILL CBD PRODUCTS WITH THC  INSIDE SHOW UP ON A  DRUG TEST? WE ASKED  MICHELLE EDMUNDSON,  OWNER OF E AND S HEMP  COMPANY IN WINTERVILLE. \"we ask people to come see their doctors they go they talk to their doctors and then 90 percent of them go and  come back and the doctor says its fine and the second thing is do you have to take a drug test..\" \"so yeah it will  march right across and get into your blood stream.\" EDMUNDSON SAID INITIALLY SHE HAD HER  DOUBTS ABOUT CBD PRODUCTS.  \"I thought it was a snake  oil.\" YET AFTER SEEING POSITIVE RESULTS IN  HER HEALTH.. SHE DECIDED TO OPEN  THE SHOP.  \"I was on antidepressant medicine, no longer on any of that, don't have to take  anything to sleep any more my anxiety levels are down.\" AND MANY OF HER  CLIENTS SAY THEY TOO HAVE HAD POSITIVE  EXPERIENCES WITH IT. \"I have clients that have  fiber myalgia, arthritis,  hashimotos, lupis, rheumatoid arthrisits, osteoarthris, and the cbd oil  brings down that inflammation and helps their pain.\" ONE FATHER TELLS  ME HIM AND HIS WIFE  CREATED THEIR OWN  BRAND OF CBD OIL FOR THEIR SON WHO  SUFFERED FROM  SEIZURES.  \"knowing that we were able to do it naturally for him and do it the right way, what we feel is the right way I  honestly still emotional about it because hes thriving.\"  NOW, WALLACE SAYS HIS  SON NOAH IS SEIZURE  FREE.. THEY CREDIT THAT TO  CBD \"you know hes three  and a half and hes brilliant he has no issues and its just  an amazing experience to create something and hopefully help other people  as well.\" ANOTHER  QUESTION OF CONCERN  IS.. IS IT LEGAL? \"now its  presumably legal at the  federal level but you have regulatory agencies like the FDA contacting distributors  saying you are going too far marketing this as an effective drug.\" OILS, DROPLETS UNDER THE TONGUE, AND TOPICALS ARE ALL LEGAL  ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF  AGRICULUTURE ONLY IF THEY ARE SOLD WITHOUT  HEALTH CLAIMS. IN 2018 THE FDA  APPROVED A DRUG WITH CBD AS AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT CREATED TO  HELP CHILDREN WITH EPILEPSY.  NOW THE AG DEPARTMENT SAYS SINCE  THIS FORM OF CBD,  CALLED \"CBD ISOLATE\" , CBD IN ITS PURESTEST FORM.. IS IN THE NEW  MEDICATION.. ANY FOOD PRODUCTS  ON THE MARKET WITH THIS CBD FORM IS ILLEGAL TO SELL. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO SENT LETTERS TO RETAIL SHOPPES, LIKE EDMUNSONS INFORMING  THEM ABOUT THE NEW REGULATIONS..  SHE SAYS SHE HAS PULLED ITEMS ITEMS WITH CBD ISOLATE OUT OF HER STORE.  tag THE FDA WILL HOST A  PUBLIC FORUM ON MAY  31ST AT THEIR WHITE OAK  CAMPUS IN WASHINGTON DC TO DISCUSS SOME OF  THESE NEW  REGULATIONS.

times each 30 gummies so um they're pretty tasty i had a couple already like two of them i loved how they taste they're pretty sour they look like this so there you have it um yeah i decided to do a

"YT5GRLadfKU": "hey what's up everybody i was recently making a list of over-the-counter products that can help you decrease anxiety and stress and i ran into hemp gummies while i was browsing on amazon i was really impressed with the reviews that i saw it was not easy selecting a bottle as there are plenty of bottles with good reviews and some very confusing numbers on the label you'll see big numbers such as 400 000 all the way up to 1 million that i've seen recently and i had no idea what that meant a lot of these are also marketed the same way they have big numbers in the front unclear nutritional information on the back lots of health claims and happy people and photos with lots of lighting the bottle that i purchased was based on the reviews not based on just the highest number on the bottle if the bottle does not list the milligrams per gummy divide the total number in the front on this bottle it's 240 000 by the number of gummies 60. so that's 4 000 milligrams of what hemp oil also known as hemp extract on the bottle so here was my experience i initially took two gummies per day the first couple of weeks then after that i took about four per day i was curious because the claims were stress relief reduced inflammation improve sleep reduce anxiety reduce depression so they have a strong gummy bear smell with something else that i can't really identify the texture is softer than your typical gummy bear so initially they taste just like your regular gummy bear then there's another flavor behind it and i can't really identify it i had a headache the first day that i took one so i figured hey this is a perfect opportunity the headache really didn't go away i wasn't subjected to like a lot of stress so i can't speak to that on the first day nothing noticeable around the first try it did not change any anxiety ticks that i have it did not make me sleepy i was reading the news like always before i went to sleep so really there was nothing noticeable the first days other than eating a delicious gummy a month later i was reflecting upon any benefits because initially i didn't feel any and it seems to help with arthritis i have wrist arthritis right where my thumb meets the wrist and i suffered less during the month that i was taking them but the effects were not immediate it just took some time with regards to anxiety and depression i found the results negligible like a drop in the bucket kind of experience so i was curious about why these hemp gummies are so popular let's talk about cannabis a little bit so there are over 150 identified cannabinoids in cannabis with thc and cbd being the most popular so thc will give you that high and the cbd gives you the calming effects so let me clarify amazon does not sell cbd products so no these gummies don't contain cbd and they obviously don't contain thc but some people thought they did in the reviews the association with cannabis plant may be what brings customers to this product so let's talk hemp so hemp is a specific strain of the cannabis plant hemp is high in cbd but it is very low in thc i believe american grown ham has less than point zero two percent thc but the cbd is mainly found in the leaves and the flowering of the hemp plant but there is no cbd in the hemp seed which is what these gummies are made from so if the gummies don't contain cbd or thc then what are you getting so let's look at hemp seed oil about 75 percent of hemp seed oil is composed of omega fatty acids the rest is a monounsaturated and saturated fats about 50 percent of the hemp seed oil is omega-6 fatty acids more specifically linolenic acid about 17 is omega-3 fatty acids more specifically alpha linolenic acid i also noticed that this composition is very similar to flax seed oil so any benefits that people are talking about in the reviews is from omega fatty acids so i was curious and i did a search for omega 3 6 and 9 products and sure enough the reviews were aligned with the hemp gummy reviews yeah improved memory healthier skin lower cholesterol improved immune system reduce arthritis pain less anxiety essentially the hemp gummies are a cannabis-derived source of omega-3 and six fatty acids would i buy these again no for each of the benefits that are cited in the reviews there are actually other supplements that do a better job of addressing these issues that's for another video did i waste my time on this no from this experience i read up more on omega fatty acids and i found that omega-3 works great at reducing arthritis pain but the best source of omega-3 is fish oil so thanks to this hemp gummy i'm currently taking omega-3 fish oil that's a wrap if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below i always add more information in the description of the video thanks for watching", "2e4fl1RSaEc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "njWP70F7L3c": "[Music] you [Music]", "zmRfwsHXJk4": "yes here I was right it's marketed as a miracle cure-all like I used CBD for good luck and it's pretty good but what are you really getting when buying CBD Fox 11 is going undercover we're purchasing CBD at different locations across Los Angeles we're teaming up with dr. oz to have it professionally tested with startling results we were able to find additional microbial contamination this is just the wild wild west that really is this investigation is gonna be I open e because it's gonna give us and clips into an industry with little regulation I'm excited to partner with Fox 11 Fox LA to pull back the curtain on what you could be really getting when you purchase CBD products CBD or cannabidiol is one of the most prominent components of the hemp plant unlike marijuana CBD has little or no THC the psychoactive part of the plant that gets you high proponents say CBD has all the benefits of medical marijuana without the intoxicating side effects able to help with pain anxiety insomnia epilepsy even cancer and heart disease sales have been exploding but there is almost no government regulation which can open consumers up to the unknown in this country when we buy something we expect to get what we pay for that's why dr. oz is joining forces with Fox 11 his team purchased several different CBD products in New Jersey to test at the same time our Fox 11 undercover photographer and I went to a variety of locations here in our viewing area as we played the part of interested buyers we stopped by several stores selling CBD all of which advertised major health benefits for the product let me try that and I'll get the few things and we purchased a mix of CBD infused goods ranging from edibles to creams and liquids okay so we've now about around at several different locations and we got a bag full of different CBD products right here I'm going to take all of this everything we've bought today we're gonna take it up to the lab for testing after a quick drive up to Chatsworth we arrived at nascent a premium cannabis testing lab we delivered our CBD products to their team and the lab began processing them for testing with the samples dr. Oz's team bought and less than 24 hours later all of the results are in in terms of safety this one failed the gummy bears this one failed and this one failed pediatrician dr. pedram sell and pour in a C and C oo dr. Leah Schaefer reviewed all of the testing results with Fox 11 when it comes to CBD levels five of the samples had a reading of nd meaning no CBD was detected despite claims on the labeling if you have a consumer that's trying to take it medicinally then you know it's basically snake oil out of all the samples tested only one product had what it claimed to others were close five products had no CBD detected four products had significantly less CBD and one product had more CBD and some of the products had major health concerns one of them was this CBD lemonade shot we bought in Hollywood testing showed it contains no CBD but it did test positive for abnormally high levels of ethanol these CBD gummy bears purchased by the dr. oz team also tested positive for high levels of ethanol but it was these CBD gel caps brought into the lab by a concerned customer that had the most startling results they did have CBD in them but they also tested positive for a strain of e.coli that produces the deadly bacteria known as Shiga toxin not only at the consumer getting any medicinal value from it they're actually introducing I talk with them a lot of people take CBD because they have cancer and the thing about patients who have cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy is that they're immunocompromised the last thing you want to do to an immunocompromised person is introduced a whole bunch of microbes into their body equal life testing showed those same gel caps also had almost three milligrams of THC per cap when it's supposed to have zero THC three milligrams is a lot 3 milligrams is enough to get a grown man or a grown woman high a child that weighs 10 or 20 kilos would definitely get very very high for a very long time with that amount of THC that can be a huge problem for parents who give CBD to their kids believing it will cure their ailments this stuff is packaged and designed to look like medicine when you buy medicine you expect clinical precision but unfortunately the lab results show something very very different and that's why dr. Salim poor says even though there are good actors in the CBD marketplace this investigation shows buying CBD can come down to a roll of the dice with your money and more importantly your health there's no way for a consumer to know that it has failed these tests and that's why it's a crapshoot that's why it's the Wild West because there's nobody regulating the production or sale of CBD products today [Music] now even though the sale of industrial hemp was legalized via the farm bill last year the FDA still considers CBD a drug so technically it's still illegal for it to be sold in any food or drinks or as a dietary supplement essentially exactly how it's being sold right now and that's why there's no federal regulation now the National hemp Association says that's a big problem telling us in a statement in part quote current inconsistencies happen with CBD products due to a lack of standards and regulations these regulations will be vitally important for consumers not only to ensure that what is in the product is what is on the labels but also for consistency in dosing it is imperative that the FDA quickly develop a legal and reasonable regulatory path for CBD products to protect both consumers and the industry and quote so guys just to put it in the big picture for you out of the 13 products we tested only three of them came close to what was advertised on the label you just need something really important in your story and that's parents that give CBD to their kids that have ailments or other issues this seems like the wild wild west it absolutely is look for instance the FDA has only approved one single drug that has CBD in it they did it in June of last year and it's a drug called epidural X it's used to treat two very rare forms of childhood seizures it works very well but unfortunately it costs 30 grand a year not a lot of parents have that kind of money so what they're doing is they're going out to stores and they're buying the kind of CBD products that you saw on the story right there just off the shelves hoping to give it to their kids and hopefully help them and as you just saw in the story who knows what you're getting in some of these products there are good actors out there there are some good companies that have what they say on the labels but as you can see you know not all the products live up to the bill and to wrap up we'll see more with you and dr. oz on on Friday yeah we taped an entire segment with them they're gonna air our investigation that'll be on their Friday show Friday afternoon all right set your DVR", "Vh0OxaEWHaQ": "hey kids this is ragged o7 with you and actually kids do not need this product I'm going to review let me like you know you know anyways this is CBD gummies and they are fabulous this will be my third day on them they do relax you they I believe helps with pain it really helps a anxiety which God knows I take enough of that I hate it pain relief yes definitely my leg because of this weather is like it hurts really bad I can't even explain to you I don't I tried moving as much as I can because you know I got to keep the muscles and step up but oh my god you guys the pain is unbelievable in days and as you all know I'm a very anxious person too so it helps with that I slept really good for the past two nights it reduces my stress did you get relaxing calm it's it's fabulous it is ten let me I left it over here on my craft table so and yes I did take this picture where is it Wow okay oh it is on my desk no I haven't taken anything yes that's crazy all right let me give you the ingredients of this stuff because if you do suffer with pain and anxiety rather get jacked up and addicted to oxycontin vicodin the whole nine yards okay seriously try these really usually I have to take a half a pain pill a day because yes my pain is that great so if anybody wants to make an issue out of it talk to me all right you don't need to this stuff this crazy stuff this is all-natural by the way and this is for the serving from one gummy full spectrum organic can have an all CBD and that's the main ingredient in here it's only ten milligrams I've seen them go as high as a hundred online in sane No thank you first of all I would be asleep because it does relax you as nine calories per bear total fat zero which is nice sodium three milligrams total carbohydrates two grams sugars two grams that's pretty healthy if you really think about it other ingredients sugar corn syrup gelatin citric acid calcium lactate seriously it says lactate okay silicon dioxide natural and artificial flavors suggested uses take one to two gummies daily too thoroughly before swallowing course you know the FDA is not it dis is so stupid after you exclaim er these statements have not been equated by the FDA this product is not intended to treat or cure or prevent any disease [ __ ] okay um that's just my thoughts there is no THC and this is not a marijuana product of course not it's a little happy gummy bear which makes me kind of giggle because I'm not a Grateful Dead fan guys trust me by any means and it's made in the USA cha-ching that that's good um but it reminds me of the Grateful Dead bears yeah who cares I don't care I'm not a very good I'm not a Grateful Dead fan and just their music to me is just like you don't even need heroin oh let's put you down you know I mean so what I'm trying to say here is treat yourself naturally until we get the real deal the stores I have seen one store open and it's up by Lake Erie and I think that my friend and I are gonna go rent a car and we're gonna go up there and check it out see what we can do I'm very excited for this I do need I'm going to get a card as soon as I get a doctor that will prescribe it to me my doctor will not do it because you know she's within the government and if there's no I go back if that's for marijuana you just want to get high no no trust me no I like being sober okay to me when I use cannabis it's I might be a little giggly or happier less stress it's I'm so sick of these stupid nannies god I need a light kills children it doesn't kill children okay first of all what the hell are your kids getting into your stash I thought so so let's not go there I do not I'm sick and tired of certain people in my building that simply think that I'm doing this just to get high they could guess it and yeah what can I say alright so anyways this has been a ragged o7 production I'm going to be doing a lot more of these kind of reviews because I think it's important I really do I think that people need to see that this is not an ad in a monic thing at all okay it doesn't alter you like that and you want to see something that's dangerous okay go and look up that what is that stuff called that makes people like bath salts stuff like that wicked heroine wicked cocaine wicked cannabis no problem okay I'm not I'm not promoting it I'm not promoting it I'm just giving you the pros and cons right the only thing about this stuff is it does relax me and I do feel slightly sleepy so no big whoop anyways I love you guys god bless you peace be with you and you know what have a very awesome day talk to you later I love you", "Bz_WICcMyU4": "are you wondering which CBD edible is most suitable for you here's a hint it's certainly not CBD gummy bears hemp taffy is a much better choice than CBD gummies let us tell you why taffy is made to be chewed and while you're chewing away you're absorbing CBD under your tongue giving you the effective results gummy products on the other hand are swallowed quickly cutting the absorption rate and effectiveness significantly we make our taffy with all-natural goodness and never with artificial flavors sweeteners or animal source gelatin found in many gummies our delicious hemp taffy is infused with full spectrum CBD extract during production while gummy products are often only coated with a single isolate extract making them sticky bitter and much less effective so which CBD edible is better him taffy of course we worked hard to make it that way for you during the production process we focus on providing the highest quality ingredients in each batch resulting in out the product with amazing taste and superior absorption why because we care about you and your health whether you're searching for a CBD edible for chronic pain anxiety or even acne we know you're looking for the healthiest choice so look no further than the all-natural goodness in him taffy the world's best CBD edible [Music]", "Vqba_qGgG7I": "so do SD nano bytes edible hundred milligrams TSE 10 pieces potent Silvia see if you can get dear give me the what's in it hey that's what's in it funny way to open it yes we try to open it this way it'll never [ __ ] happen all right so you got a go on this side and this is what you get for like 20 bucks out here in Colorado", "8G0uy08bGNo": "[Music] welcome back so today well yesterday we went to see bd+ and got some new and goodies he decided to try out some new radicals there little gummies yeah squid yep and so there are 10 milligrams per serving and there's ting servings in each pack yeah and they are full spectrum hemp so it does have less than point 30 percent THC in each serving but for us today we're gonna take the little thing just because 10 milligrams of CBD with how much we have been smoking it and everything isn't gonna do much for us so for it to really work and has to give you the full effect how did you open pictures open [Music] and yes it for me I have the blue raspberry I have the Concord grape and what's interesting about them is like they're colored with natural products mine's colored with cabbage as far as like rubbish yes that's interesting okay so yeah it comes out as these little video gummies I don't know even how to do the individual servings personally you try it yeah you'd have to definitely cut it it does have like little marks to show you like where to cut but don't think that's easy to pull apart that's all good I just say you can definitely do the CBD in there but you can taste how much more natural it is is there seriously like a handful of ingredients there's coconut oil full spectrum hemp extra citric acid organic sugar and water I mean I teach a little bit I taste a little bit of the grape yeah yeah so way to go lunchbox alchemy yeah these are really good so we are at our local mall and we're just gonna kind of walk around I was wanting it to go into forever 21 to see if they have plus-sized stuff for me to try on and probably get some lunch since we have an 8 today it's up for this yeah but alright guys so we'll see you in a bit later so now we're like in the middle towards the end of our walk we've come to a few different stores yeah I still hopefully energetic yeah we walk it's more the only reason why we're stopping is because I decided to wear my combat boots today and they're happy on my feet so they're beautiful yeah you know it's all aesthetic and cute but I'm just not very cute oh yeah and right now we're about to go and Macy's and I'm gonna try to spray the fragrances to you know compare from my shop right yeah and we back in the cop sorry that the lighting is a little weird the sun's like in a weird spot right now but there you go yeah we're back in the car I got to finally smell my Viktor & Rolf bonbon so good I knew that had to be I've looked at what's all in it it's good just don't we're at the price I just can't spend there it's been sitting us to get a fragrance rate like that whenever I spray for you freely all day long he has to over all those gummies definitely helped highly recommend it tastes good - yeah they tasted really good the only thing that I think people are gonna have a problem with is the splitting just because it is a gummy so I think you've been cutting it will be a little difficult but the only way I can see possible is to cut into it Jonathas definitely from TV first for telling us about them yes and I will be linking in our description exactly where you can get it online on CD plus stop yeah I know let's say it's a we're delighting right now yeah thank you guys so much and we will see you next time and remember to spread the peace in that we do best my guys later [Music]", "QLZYQwg7ynU": "hey what's up news is this email vlog like comment subscribe and what I'm gonna do is give you an update of the CBD that I've been using is that let's take it from the marijuana plant and it's this extract that certain parts THC is totally different from CBD but they look the same and supposedly what CBD does it helps you with your anxiety it helps you with pain and so it's been a week since I've been using CBD after couple days of being on CBD and I was like feeling the effects of red at work in it and at home and because my wife was going through some stressors I figured I was like here take two of these and call me in the morning and after the first day she came back and she was like man I just like felt like really really mellow and everything was like man and she stressed out about anything she was able to work and focus on stuff that she needed to do sobs I'm saying is that my wife has joined me in using and trying CBD so just because there's both of us on that on a jar of our gummies it got done like we finished it by the fifth day southern I was in conflict what what I should do should I keep on continuing CBD gum is I should i do CBD oil and there are some reports out there that CBD oil is a little bit more effective it just doesn't have that necessary taste you've gotta figure because like when you mix make stuff with food it kind of takes out two effects and get spread around or whatever it's getting it gets diluted so I went to CBD oil route let me show you how I take it what I do is take like one of these and it's about 15-20 drops but since I counted out I just dropped the whole thing you're supposed to drop it under your tongue didn't he like let her stand your tongue for like 30 seconds [Music] so of course this Christmas like straight-up oil there's like no no added flavors or anything and it's not gonna taste the best but it's not the worst either its oil so on to review okay so I've been on City for at least a week and I have been at work quite a few days where I have been able to see the results and I had filled the reserves and it's like really really helpful so the noticeable effects that has for me is the shoulder the inflammation is down there like the whole anxiety thing is not there and I think the reason why they anxiety thing is not there is because my mind is not racing so much but it doesn't like slows it down and just like is that alright man this is good this is good check it off alright it kind of slows down everything versus when I used to be like alright I got this this this this is okay that this that's what this discusses with this this goes with that and okay I got everything yes double check triple check so that's how my mind used to race all the time but benign and CBD just like brings it down and so what I'm trying to say is that for the past five days at work I have not messed up an order once and it could and it could be the whole reason of me plateauing or are coming to a level of understanding at the position how are those is pretty much saying is that the CBD has helped me in so many ways I want to continue using it and to go off my first video where I said it was like feeling this little bit of effects that could fill the flutters and whatever the men resist at the relaxation I could feel it coming down it wasn't like I was like feeling a weird feeling it was just like oh I can sense this but one side effect was that our wife our she's giving like an allergic reaction to the smaller governments that we're getting so removed from that and when she was started going back to the Apple rings one and I'm using the oil so I guess there's a potential to people who might have some sort of allergic reactions might have an allergic reaction to the - the gummies are what's inside the government's that's awesome so after the first week of being a CBD I think it's two thumbs up give it a try there's nothing to fear but all in the benefits of your anxiety coming down and some some relief on on information that you may have and actually had a couple other people tell me that day they've been on it for years and and it helps them out with all the issues that they have a wider range of issues then then I even knew about yeah so this is say my vlog and that's my week review of CBD oil CBD gummies and the whole CBD effects and the impact and and how it's making life so much easier and anxiety is not an issue really but I did have one moment where anxiety almost got me was because the roads were like pure ice and I started kind of like fishtail in it and when I started doing that and I see the ice like my whole body tenses up and my back like really feels in Amida so I had that just for like a couple seconds then once I stopped fishtailing I was all good alright I know what to do I know how to drive and I just drove I chilled me so the moral of the story is keep driving me just drive okay man I still say I know the way sounds to me sounds like I saw it pretty bad my car got a little bit worse over the past couple days so yeah luckily I am on my days off I got one more day after the boss hooked me up with three days off I love it ok I'm blabbering time ago that's my review if we started doing CBD because you watched my other video comment down below comment down below if we're thinking of trying CBD because this week review so so the next review that I'll probably not do is oh it's a 30-day review so be looking for that alright yeah there's still a vlog I'm out of here in three two one peace up my needs my CV [Music] [Music] [Music]", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I

"nV5mhbeNTBU": "[Music] welcome back to the channel y'all it's so great to have y'all here or there you know wherever you are if you're returning i'm glad that you found whatever you were seeing hearing connecting with to be fascinating enough to you know tune back in so a lot of you guys have been commenting and referencing and just like talking overall about cannabis and thc and cbd um to deal with severe anxiety and just mental illness in general sort of that whole realm of like herbal health or herbal medicine a little bit of context slash background for me i have like unofficially slash officially um like i don't know like if is it unofficial if you're like doing it yourself but like i don't have any education to like back it up so it's kind of like very amateurly using cannabis to treat my anxiety in all honesty it was like really the only thing that was working slash like has worked to treat like my day-to-day anxiety not like panic attacks or anxiety attacks but like the anxiety that i have that like makes just like life harder and if you have anxiety then like you probably know what i mean if you don't then i guess i can try to explain it so like around work for instance you know i'll have to send emails sometimes i'll have like a dumb ass question or a question that i think is dumb um or you know sometimes i'll have to like correct somebody um because like i know i'm correct and i know that they're wrong as [ __ ] but like you know they need to know that or sometimes like i need to admit something that i can't do communication in general at work you get the point um i have trouble with obviously i still execute it because we enjoy a paycheck we love the employment you know being able to live is fantastic but my anxiety literally makes things at work slower so it's like not crippling in the sense that like i'm still able to do things but like i'll draft an email um i'll read it like 10 times i'll wait an hour i'll read it another 10 times i'll wait an hour and then you know press send close my computer and then run away and like pretend like i didn't send it and the difference between just like nervousness is that like everyone gets nervous obviously this happens over like the simplest of simplest questions so as you can imagine it happens like every single hour that pretty much simply goes for everything in my life so cannabis i have like really used to sort of like get me through that in the sense that like i won't have those inhibitions and i'll just like cruise on along and it'll be dope but these are just cbd gummies um and they are no thc they're just cbd i've been using these for about like a month or so now um and it's the same way i've been using or the same way i was using xanax when i was prescribed um as needed so when i feel myself really feeling that like um that anxiousness or like that irritability rising or when i notice like shy honestly my four month year old dog is a really good um tester of that or like indicator of like all right you're a little bit too anxious or too like you're a little bit too on edge right now um and that's because he's annoying as [ __ ] but like not really he's actually a really really good dog um scarily enough like for him to be a four-month puppy he like listens a little bit too well but i'm not complaining obviously however though when he is being like his puppy self and i'm just like not having it and it reaches to the point where like all right you need to understand that he is a puppy and that's just in his nature he's a pretty good indicator that like all right something is off for me like mood wise hopefully all that makes sense um and that's like when i take one of these um it's just like an edible you just take one or two i guess it says one on here they are 500 milligrams um so i don't really know if that's a lot or if that's a little um like i said that's perfect for me and i bought this one earlier in like i would say mid-october and there's like was like four in here left um and i just picked up this one like two weeks ago um i don't know it's a lot like a lot in here not like a lot lot but like a decent number so overall the um 6.3 ounce can um of 500 milligram cbd gummies uh it lasts me about a month and a half i'd say for me um now like my anxiety honestly like with some hiccups there here and there has not been to the point of like severe extreme like oh my god like levels um in a while i'm not even sure if these [ __ ] would work for that been like pretty moderate to mild so you know just really do what works best for you it's more like you know there's so many things going on in my mind and my brain is moving so fast i'm moving so fast in terms of like tasks in terms of just like life in general um people tend to piss me off like things that don't like work well tend to piss me off like traffic like i'm just an angry person and i don't necessarily like i do feel like irritable and i do feel like a little bit more angry but i wouldn't say that like i'm always conscious of it friends who are like asking like what i would say stupid questions i'd be like why are you asking me to ask questions like just shut up and don't say anything um and there's like a thousand different examples like that um but people don't like that um people don't like when you're irritable especially when you're elevated for long periods of time as in like you know weeks or months um and like that when that just becomes your personality that's not great um it also like can get to the point where it starts to feel uncomfortable within me so like while i do not describe myself as an angry person i don't think i'm angry all the time um within those like quick seconds that it like does flare up and i get like so frustrated and irritated um it's like not a comfortable inside feeling like i my heart rate is like up i'm like oh my god there's so much to do what the [ __ ] oh my god okay i just like i like get stressed and that's where these have been the most helpful um so like people always typically think of anxiety as being nervousness it is but like you know a lot of times anxiety is irritation and like you know just frustration cannabis honestly like flower by itself like the thc component for me like it made things better but it also slowed me down um like significantly so sometimes it would like make the frustration worse if that makes sense like if i'm trying to do like work or if i'm trying to do a paper or if i'm like trying to do something obviously after using cannabis you're like not like really moving at the fastest of paces um sometimes i am like i guess if it's the right strain but like other times you know i'm moving very slowly um i also feel more creative or like more i pay more attention to detail um so it's annoying that like i have to pay attention to like such like superfluous detail in the work that i'm doing that like i'm frustrated that i'm moving so slowly and like it's a great product but like the frustration just builds that doesn't do any of this it's essentially like freaking taking an edible without like the brain delayed versions of cannabis i guess i don't know you guys i'm just like really [ __ ] happy with it um it like helps me sleep um you know because i have trouble sleeping at night slash like i don't ever want to go to sleep it helps me eat now that that's like an extremely important point um if you remember from my earlier videos like a lot of times or like recently i have been feeling you know a little um disoriented in terms of like how i see myself weight wise and have been you know possibly potentially maybe like choosing not to eat certain meals which we all know is like not good and all but if i'm hungry then i'm hungry so like i'm going to eat don't care um i just like haven't been hungry and i'm not like sure if that's like because of some other stuff or if that's because of like the hypomania i don't know this helps me like eat though it makes me hungry not in the same way cannabis does like i don't have the munchies but i like do have um the ability or like i eat like a normal person originally i had tried cbd like in 2017 and it was like the cbd oil i was in london in like i think i can't remember why i was trying it but it wasn't with the intention to like treat my anxiety because i hadn't like experienced like my severe crippling not like can't move type of [ __ ] anxiety until like the year after that so i either bought it trying to feel some of the psych effects which by the way you can't do like if you feel something off of these like it's not these so with the oil though it was like it was just gross and like i don't necessarily like i didn't eat you don't eat oil obviously you smoke it um but like even in smoking it i just remember being really heavy the taste like i think it was like literally just pure oil and i think that's why i didn't like it it literally tasted like i was vaping like freaking canola oil or something i don't know just wasn't for me and like i said for the longest period of time normal cannabis flour or cannabis concentrate or like cannabis edibles or whatever like that worked for me perfectly fine now obviously i have bipolar disorder as well so there's a lot of debate whether or not that like i should be doing that at all to begin with i'm a firm believer of people doing what makes them feel the best now obviously that is a fine line very fine and difficult line to like describe and draw and define but it's important nonetheless in the sense that like all right somebody could be like oh yeah this is great for me it works wonders for my anxiety when like it's actually low-key making them manic and like destroying their lives and they're like low-key addicted like that's obviously not what we want i honestly did feel as though and slash i do feel i just don't use it as much because i have these babies um i honestly do feel as though it was working at that point in time in my life for like in periods in my life it really was perfect for my anxiety essentially the psychoactive part of cannabis um like the thc part um makes me like more manic or elevates my mood even more i didn't like cbd before because like honestly i just kind of like the feeling that i got even if i wasn't hypomanic like i liked the elevated feeling yes i used cannabis for anxiety but i also used it to have fun [ __ ] honestly i would never say that this could replace like a mood stabilizer because like my mood like it's still pretty much like up there um but it does like it tailors it like it fine tailors like the aspects in my life i would imagine because i'm not technically on a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic or any of that jazz but it's made life a lot better in the sense that like if i was ready and willing and at the place to put certain things in my life to kind of normalize it completely again and that's super vague and doesn't make any sense um if i was super dedicated to making sure i went to bed early you know making sure that you know i was getting the right amount of sleep making sure that i was eating right um basically making sure i'm doing all the steps that i need to as a person living with bipolar disorder who is currently hypomanic and does not want to be slash like wants to have a stable mood um like there's a lot of things this is like an aid to that so it like makes things easier i guess why is this always like so hard to explain um it's like this is gonna sound really weird but um you know when you're putting up a shower curtain and you have to line up the holes to fit the like circle the ring thingy so that it can be held there um cbd basically helps me line those holes up just perfectly um that putting the shower curtain up is like super easy without cbd the shower curtain's like falling down like the holes are misaligned like i missed the hole shit's a mess it's up there you know the shower curtain's up there but [ __ ] is sloppy looking and it's just like it's not it's not pretty these allow for your stable pretty shower curtain to be hung and for it to look fabulous and for you not to ruin your floors and get water everywhere without those though i would probably be back where i was this summer um and if you remember how that was i'm not really sure how sustainable that was all right y'all um that's all i have for y'all for today in terms of reviewing these guys um i am going to be talking a lot more about these and i know i always say that but i do want to make more videos about the endocanna cannonaboid cannanavoid system the science essentially behind these babies and what that means for the bipolar brain but i do want to update y'all in terms of like other cbd products i'm trying and just how these are going in general if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and if you want to comment anything any cbd products that you like how shitty your anxiety is too you know we can relate on that um basically anything obviously feel free and comment and lastly of course remember to subscribe and turn on those subscription notifications because you will then find out when i upload another video about cbd peace", "pJAu3xO0IzQ": "hello viewers alright so today I want to talk about one of my favorite CBD

product around they sell these in three different strengths they have be 500 a thousand and 3,000 milligrams and those start at 3499 the the oil has minimal taste you can put it in pretty much anything which is just makes it really easy to consume you can put it in your morning coffee or you can even use it externally if you want to rub it on an area in pain or if you're feeling any discomfort they have the CBD gel capsules so these are just really easy to take with a glass of water for a regular or even daily intake they have two strengths for these capsules the 25 milligrams and the 50 milligrams and it starts at $44.99 these are also travel friendly since they contain zero THC so you can even take these on an international flight which can be really convenient if you just want to take a cool relaxing no stress flight they even have a specific morning blend that combines the CBD with caffeine and the b6 and b12 vitamins so it gives you that really good energy boost to start your day off right then they have the dissolvable sleep tablets they start at $55.99 and those combined CBD with 10 milligrams of melatonin so if you need a little help getting to sleep at night then these would be the perfect solution for you they're also spearmint flavored so you can take those right after brushing your teeth and it won't you know screw up your fresh breath just put it under your tongue let it dissolve and to just sleep like a baby these are a great option if you're trying to weave off sleeping pills these are natural products and don't have like weird side effects like sleeping pills can so I really recommend for you to try these and as med Tara has a 30-day money-back guarantee then you have nothing to lose so give it a go that may have the cooling creams which is great if you have any eggs and pains in a specific area they provide the cooling creams in a few dosage they have the 250 and the 750 milligram starting at $49.99 those are a blend of CBD menthol and arnica that provides that rapid cooling effect to help with any muscle or joint discomfort I've been using the creams to help with knee pain after I go for a run outside I don't know if it happens to you but when I run on the pavement my knees kind of hurt and the CBD creams have really helped with that and lastly they have the pet products so if you are an animal lover like myself if you've got a cat or dog that's a little old or you know needs help getting around or is is nervous taking a flight I really recommend you tried the CBD oil for pets these are great to mix in with their food and they offer those in true format so you can give these to your dogs or your cat as a treat oh and they offer different bundles depending on your needs they've got the comfort bundle they've got the evening wellness bundle that contains the oil and the capsules if you're having trouble sleeping and they have a few pet bundles as well all right thank you for watching if you're interested in any of these products just head to the link in the video description it has the best deals and it's updated regularly all right have a great day", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "nIzOyZ2-vVg": "hola amigos welcome back it's Kelsey push these sativa zebra and today I have a product review that I'm going to be sharing with you guys and just gonna be tough guys about basically all my thoughts and opinions about a while draft so if you are anxious to try them and just worry about them continue watching how I'm going to do product reviews is a couple processes so first it's going to be the packaging what my immediate thoughts are when I see it I'm also going to talk about the flavor of each edible or comfortable or whatever I'm like you notice how the kind of extra factors of it delayed popping and yeah and then just tell you how high it got me and whether or not I would buy it again and yet today we are outside on the balcony because my husband you know we're at home coronavirus so he's in a meeting and yeah we're just gonna do it out here and this way I can smoke while I talk so when when when when I was not paid to do this I was given some edibles from a friend who works a dispensary and he wanted to give me I always give him my opinion because I love edibles and he trusts my opinion and I figured if I'm doing that for him why not just do it for everybody like yeah so um yeah I'm not getting paid this is like I just want to give you guys my opinion and I want to give you guys backs in truth and I'm not going to alright so yeah I'm not getting paid for this I have not been sponsored nothing this is just gonna be my my [ __ ] opinion and I'm gonna tell you guys what I think and I'm gonna be like very maybe harsh I don't know like I'm just I don't want to lie to you guys I don't ever want you guys to think that I am being untruthful or unauthentic let's [ __ ] get into it first things first I absolutely love this packaging so this packaging is first like it's super cute you can like you know who whose company this is just by the luck it is so unique and that is just oh my it's beautiful um the other thing is if you are kind of someone who likes to be more sustainable more eco-friendly I also like the packaging because it's really compact so like this is it this is all of the packaging but like this is kind of like normal size packaging compared to wild and then a lot of other companies are going to kind of like those bags again hiding the brand they're going into like these little bags which still there's a lot of packaging for ten gummies like you're not getting a whole bunch in here you're getting ten so we don't need this extra packaging so that's like the first thing I want to say is shout out to wile for really you know thinking that you go consciously like the less waste we can create as an industry the better and the fact that this is hike I mean it's so compact I I can probably go on for hours about how much I love this packaging but you guys don't get the puck I mean if we're only judging on how high it gets you then like like you know my thing is we just kind of like pizza as long as it gets you high you're kind of good I I kind of expect a little bit more what can I say I'm a bougie [ __ ] I like I had a champagne taste on a very poor guy like on a very poor like you know budget so I'm gonna say first of all I really like the variety so we got this they have like one to one CBD THC they have two to one they have a 21 so for my friends or viewers who are you know you don't want to get high I'm just doing for our CBD this is an excellent product you can get because one gummy only has one milligram of THC so very very low lots of CBD in here for you and then they also have just like a traditional hybrid sits Heba quick side note so normally when a company says that they are using hybrid sativa or indica oil I can't [ __ ] um because doing the process of extraction you kill off the terpenes that give you that indica or sativa experience like most of them not off you're just getting THC and other cannabinoids so to say that that's like it's gonna give you a specific effect yeah you know when I buy I don't really care of my sister Tina indica hybrid because I understand that one thing that might change is if you see it says like um you know indica terpenes added that is where yeah we can you might experience those effects the effect of an edibles has to deal with your personal biochemistry so like for me I I'm weird I don't have like indicas make me like super excited and give me energy sativa is kind of like calm me down you know everybody's different it's Marion Barry I didn't know what to expect I am NOT a big blackberry fan I love this like this is my favorite flavor now I I'm surprised with as many gummies left in here as possible as there is because yeah I have ate so many cuz they're so good like this is the best flavor in my opinion so if you just want to try it get this it gotta say into cup like I said maybe it will put you to sleep maybe it well it's good 100% depend on your biochemistry it's it's a placebo effect so they say this is indica and so you're like oh indica in the couch I'm gonna fall asleep and so that's how you like you tell yourself that in your brain and then it ends up happening its placebo unless like I said they're using natural terpenes so one downside to this is these are not vegan friendly these are made with gelatin and I was really surprised by this because this is an oregon-based company they started in Oregon they've now expanded to Washington for now Colorado and like I know there's a kind of vegan in Oregon Washington and California and so the fact that they hadn't formulated these to be vegan it was a little disappointing so if anybody from wild is watching this please like maybe reconsider like or consider like reformulating so that US vegans can also enjoy your product because that would be lovely my next favorite flavor was actually this raspberry the 22:1 CBD to THC which I also love because I was just you know pop bliss in the morning I didn't get a high I was able to go about my work and it was just it was nice knowing like they followed all regulations and laws and I'm gonna be save and that this isn't contaminated and he's like way shape or form so that's a very nice thing but yeah so this raspberry flavor was my next favorite in the pomegranate the pomegranate was also one of my favorites it's the third after the Marion berry and the what was it raspberry so there's pomegranate then we had the peach and there raspberry right Oh strawberry hello she I did the wrong one so these are the 20 to 1 so the strawberry is a 20 to 1 and it's amazing and I love them the raspberry and the peach these ones were good these were also pretty damn good one thing is that the like weed the grassy kind of like flavor definitely overpowered these gummies it was kind of like you got a kind of hint of the raspberry in the peach and then it was just weed after that I don't know I know some people like that I know some people don't just letting you guys know if he's like if you don't mind that weedy flavor these are really good I was also kind of lucky cuz I got some unenthused of this peach and so the onion fused ones were delicious and the flavor is amazing it's just peach is such a subtle flavor that you have to like balance it evenly and just [ __ ] happens so I took my edible at about 8 o'clock within I would say 25 minutes I was feeling the effects of the cannabis I was not using any other products I was only using the edibles but I still got high as [ __ ] yeah so within about 25 to 30 minutes I could kind of start feeling that kind of high that just kind of like overall like the voices go away and like you're just in the present experiencing life and about 45 minutes and I was just straight [ __ ] vibe and guys like I was living [ __ ] life I don't remember what I was doing but I remember enjoying it a lot so definitely potent definitely works really well so on the scale of how high it got me on it so I always to scale in my mind of like one to five Kelsey's five Kelsey's is like maximum high I got two five Kelsey's I slept really well at night it was overall a good good experience with these edibles so I would give them a five out of five Kelsey's for the high scale I'm gonna give this four Zebras out of five and the reason why is just because they're not vegan and so if you are someone trying to be plant-based you know you can't use that and also for a company doing so well but like minimizing their waste and like it's kind of disappointing that they didn't go that extra step to make this plant-based if you don't care about that then these are a great option but if you are someone you know like me who wants to try to live more plant-based and we're doing it for the environment doing it for you know climate change that's just a simple change there are a lot of great alternatives to gelatin that could be used and yeah like if you make the change and make you know wild again I'm talking to you so wild if you're watching if you guys make these vegan and if you end up ya reformulating them you guys will get five [ __ ] zebras I know maybe that doesn't matter I'm just some small [ __ ] youtuber but like I I can guarantee that the rest of that plant-based vegan community will be in [ __ ] love so please do that and then I will upgrade my ranking on you guys so yeah that's it for the UM wild I know they have other products so hopefully I can get some more of them and do some more reviews thank you so much for watching once again please if you like this video if you want to see more product reviews cannabis industry knowledge anything please like subscribe comment follow through the things I think you guys already know I mean I think we all watched enough [ __ ] YouTube so please just do that please share some love with me so that I can keep sharing my love with you um yeah as always I hope you guys have a super wonderful awesome day and please stay safe out there I love you guys I", "4fSyQ8imidY": "so I wanted to do a review for CBD I've been trying some of their products the two products I've tried are the peppermint full-spectrum oil and the neon gummy bears first off a little bit less important but both products taste really good the gummies I almost just ate a whole pack one time because they tasted really good and they actually work great compared to like a lot of the other companies that I've tried CBD gummies and then this stuff to CBD peppermint oil it's super strong I'll take it if I'm having trouble going to sleep I'll take a dropper in it with about 20-30 minutes I'm feeling super chill super calm and I'm usually sleep in like 20-30 minutes how they recommend this stuff I also found out that on the pack there's a QR code that you can scan and it'll tell you the lab results so you can actually see what you're putting in your body which is really cool and there's only like a few ingredients in here which are make let you know that there's not any garbage that you're that you're taking both the products super solid and highly recommend both of them I'll continue to buy these they're definitely my favorite but but I highly recommend them thanks TV", "gV4QzzgdKYk": "what's up CBD lovers welcome back to I love CBD alright so today is the long-awaited koi CBD Cummings reviews maybe not long-awaited for you but for me I was actually looking forward to doing this video this is it right here koi CBD gummies some very bold claims on the package it says America's best tasting CBD gummies by America's most trusted CBD brand definitely bold claims and you know we'll see how it holds up to these claims so this is the package this is a package it was just six I'll show you what the gummy looks like they only have a couple left yeah so they are round like this just a gummy it says coy on it even though for some reason I could have swore the first one I took didn't say anything on it I was looking forward to say coy like the picture but it didn't say anything so anyways these are the gummies there are six of them in this package total of 60 milligrams and packaged so each gummy has 10 milligrams of CBD and you know right off the back you take its gummy and the taste is okay it's not bad does have an aftertaste just like I don't know it's not it's not a sweet taste it's kind of like a little bit of bitterness or something or like yeah yes it's not a sweet taste there's definitely a very strong aftertaste but you know it's something you can deal with it's not something very terrible how are the effects on these gummies the effects are okay not bad you can definitely feel a calming effect definitely feel the anti stress and anti anxiety that you expect from CVD muscle relaxation and possibly some pain relief and stuff like that so the effects for a 10 milligram gummy are not bad now I don't have much to compare to as far as coming skull these are the first gummies 4cb gummies that I tried so the only thing that I compared to its capsules which is the same for more method of you know ingestion and comparing it to capsules it's okay you know it holds up it's not the top top or best but it's okay so just gonna keep this pretty short and if if I was to give us a rating my rating for this will be 4 out of 5 stars I don't mind that I would buy it again some reason it just keeps me how much I got this for I want to say it was like around 10 bucks or something no it wasn't ten bucks it was close to ten dollars I don't remember exactly how much it was it could have been ten dollars but a totally escaped it I mean totally escapes my mind right now so yeah that the price for it's just six gummies was not high but then again only has six gummies in there they do have a bigger package that I think has like 30 in there or something like that which is more expensive but I just wanted to try them out so this is it for koi CBD CBD gummies and my rating is 4 out of 5 stars I hope you find this useful if you're looking into buying these and if you like this video give it a like if you are not already subscribed and you like CBD like we do then subscribe and you stay updated with all my reviews all right I'll see you in the next video and I got some pretty exciting coming up and I'll see you guys later happy CBD", "uNsm2Tnt0dY": "on this episode of the cbd university podcast

of 2021 and to help me with all our new products our vice president of marketing gina bon giovanni and our vice president of sales vince gillen welcome back to both of you hi hey joe but first this is the first time we've had gina on the podcast as vice president of marketing congrats to you thank you so much very exciting um so let's talk about when it comes to new products and lots coming out lots have come out prior to this episode and then we'll give you a preview of a couple of the new products coming out within the next few weeks on our hemp bombs and one of the products on our nature script line uh let's start off with our newest cbd gummies this one is available both hemp bombs and soon in nature script and that's our immune support gummies with elderberry extract these made their debut on our social networks and our website a couple weeks ago what makes these gummies so different from our award-winning gummies that we came out with last year who wants to take that one oh man so much to say about it i love it all right well as you guys know or you may not gummies are 30 or 53 of the cbd market and a third of the nutraceutical market so it's big business lots of opportunity out there i love these elderberry gummies they contain 15 milligrams of premium cbd alongside of 50 milligrams of elderberry extract per gummy and elderberry extract is a really interesting component because it provides immunity support through its richness and vitamins and antioxidants it's huge trend right now retail vince i know you can definitely speak to that it's not slowing down and these gummies they're dairy free fat free and gluten free and personally that delicious grape flavor has me sold nice that's okay she's gonna hire me but let's let's talk about it in the retail escape um and i've got this is where you can tune into our youtube channel get some video extras see how these all look so i've got the eight count bag uh right in front of me um 120 milligrams of cbd per bag that breaks down to 15 milligrams per gummy i did the math for you so you don't have to do it and then obviously all of the nutrition facts and ingredients and our qr codes on the back they also come in uh 50 count uh bottles and that's the 100 count bottle so the varieties there but let's talk about this um correct me if i'm wrong but in the retail landscape this is what they'll primarily see but they may also see the bottles at some point depends on the type of store but elderberry to genus point is a very um trendy product ingredient and it's really taken off so uh right away when we launched these i mean we were already getting quite a few orders for for each count um pretty excited about the packaging too um people probably could see in there the it's a matte black foil look which is a little bit different than we've been doing so i'm pretty pumped about that and they taste amazing so um again it's something that in the stores people see elderberry they're attracted to given everything that happened last year and just from the community health wellness so to have this new skew is pretty exciting so now you both have ahead i'll be honest i have not had the gummies yet um you both have had the gummies yes correct so what would the flavor profile be for those who may not be familiar with elderberry uh what kind of know it is elderberry but it is kind of a grapey flavor um but they taste great like really really good so um that's all i'll say about it awesome maybe that can be the 2021 best new product when it comes uh when it comes time for some awards what do you think it tastes like i would say it's like a deep berry i like it a really deep berry um it's delicious and i love the packaging this might honestly well i don't know i say that about every product but boy that looks cool yeah this is some of my favorite packaging we've done yeah and something else to chew on no pun intended hemp bombs will soon be introducing a new flavor of gummies the botanical blends those will be available in a 50 count and 100 count tell us a little bit about these gummies that'll be coming out um a few weeks now from when this episode is published i love that i'm going to become gummy gina from this point forward but it's a classic proprietary blend it's got some natural relaxation ingredients which i really like that so if you're not a big fan of melatonin but you still want that same sort of relaxing effect i think you're going to love these and these are back by popular demand folks so customers told us they loved our classic formulation so we brought it back for you i believe those are also 15 milligrams of cbd correct yeah 50 and then they come in a 50 and 100 count model and uh stay tuned to our social networks and our website for the reveals and more information on those and then at the end of the episode we'll tell you how you can even sign up and have the opportunity to try some of the new products even before you can buy them or maybe win them stay tuned for that shifting away from gummies but continuing with edibles and i'm going to just kind of do some uh remodeling here on the if you're watching on the youtube channel and you see me moving all around because i can never keep my hands still i'm just going to remodel a little bit here and the cbd capsules um you know and love there's more of them per package and there's also a new variety but let's first talk about the quantities and then we'll let folks know in the new variety so we we adjusted the capsules to match the gummies so a 8 count 20 count 50 count and then 100 count so same 15 mgs on the original and then the higher potency obviously has 30 mgs of cbd per capsule so you'll notice this is the eight count so what used to be a bag is now kind of a nice very nice packaging box um so that's the eight count and this is the high potency version which has 30 milligrams of cbd per capsule that's uh 240 milligrams for apec right for those uh keeping track at home and then something and i'm excited about this i'm not i'm not a big sugar guy especially right before bed i do take two cbd gummies sleep gummies before i go to bed however now the capsules come in a sleep variety and this is the first time we've had a sleep variety of capsules right yeah that's correct and um do you may touch on the ingredients a little bit more but i do believe they're vegan as well correct yeah i do believe that as well yeah the capsules which is i i think that'll be a an added value for people but mainly to your point people that don't want sugar before they go to bed um i'm excited to see those and and we've already got good feedback about having a capsule melatonin cbd product which is somewhat unique i would say and uh something to point out because we did have capsules new and improved relaunch a year ago yeah nothing has changed with these capsules outside of packaging quantity and then the the sleep variety sure so joe the purpose behind this was to kind of bring home that more is better campaign that we've been working towards so you know we're leveraging our the cost savings we recognize as a fully vertically integrated company we're taking all of that savings that we recognize as a business and passing it down to the consumer through more value so as been said it was used to be a five you're gonna get eight now if it was fifteen twenty if it was sixty you're getting a hundred so i'm really excited to um you know be able to bring that to our customers and i really love the fact that these little blister packs that are in our um our eight count how great is this for travel it's perfect i can slip it right into my you know suitcase or my purse and i'm on the go so this is a great quality product and i'm pretty excited about our forthcoming launch yeah and then our final product that we'll discuss we don't have the um packaging here just yet to display but they are also coming soon uh probably within a month of this episode and it's an old favorite reimagine new flavor and that's our cbd max chill shot a new flavor more cbd and tell us a little bit more about the max chill well it did go away for a little bit and um i think it's one of those that was also brought back by demand so we reformulated and we're super excited about some raspberry flavor i believe correct yeah raspberry dream is it good though have you tried it yes it is awesome you know so would like cbd 100 milligrams per bottle uh great price point and you know i think it's uh it should do very well so but yeah it was away for a little while and then brought it back due to the demand for a quality shot product and we should mention um there's a way to get your hands on our products even before we did this with the elderberry gummies where folks can sign up provide their email address and i want you to talk a little bit about maybe some of the promotions that may be coming up especially for the capsules as we get uh ready for that i love that yeah so um go to our capsules page right now just go to hemp bombs look for current capsules right now if you give us your email address as soon as we launch these products we're going to be giving away a free a count capsule with purchase so if that's of interest to you you want to try capsules maybe you've never even tried that you're a big

"1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "cyBouHFm7SI": "busting the three most common myths about cbd gummy bears who'd have thought it gummy bears and cbd ending up not only being used together in the same sentence but actually in the same product it seems that there is little left in the world that we should be surprised about but before we get too cozy about the combination of cbd and gummy bears which all sound very innocent and sweet pun intended there are three myths surrounding them that we feel ought to be blown apart first of all cbd gummy bears do not contain the same amounts of cannabinoid some gummy bears have five milligrams of cbd in them while others have 15 milligrams now that's a huge difference in potential potency what is a good idea apart from reading the ingredient section on the bottle or packet very closely is to try and ascertain what strain of cannabis plant the cbd came from and if you can't do that at the very least try and find out how the cbd was extracted from it second cbd gummy bears do not offer fast relief contrary to what many say how do we know this well if you watched our video on cooking with cbd and the mistakes you can make there you'd understand why it only takes a few seconds to feel the effects when smoking cannabis because the cannabinoids in the cannabis enter the bloodstream almost instantly however when swallowed any form of cbd has to be ingested and then the cbd is absorbed into the bloodstream usually after a delay of approximately two hours now correct us if you think we're wrong but to us that isn't rapid thirdly and finally not all cbd gummies are safe to take the reason they are not safe isn't because of the cbd but more the case of where the cbd comes from now that cannabis can be legally grown and cbd oil can be used in certain products agriculture has begun to do what it knows best increase crops through heavy use of pesticides the problem is those pesticides tend to end up in the cbd oil that's then used to make gummy bears many pesticides are known to be carcinogens while others can have adverse effects on the body's organs if you want to take a gummy bear that is a bit safer then take one without any cbd in it though that isn't totally safe either as gummy bears are full of sugar and it is well known that too much sugar is bad for you the truth is virtually everything is bad for you if you take too much of it so use cbd gummy bears wisely and do your research and homework before you buy any we'd love to know if you've tried any we'd also love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our channel so you too can become a cannabis expert", "7nQ2KP0ZdZY": "[Music]", "tmHX3NmaV-g": "here's my forward view of combine wellness hemp CBD gummies these are awesome and especially for me I've gotten very interested in CBD and the health benefits as well I mean there are a tremendous amount of health benefits I'm gonna into in this video that have been proven in studies and basically in a lot of different research the best part about CBD as well is its non psychoactive so you don't take this and get a buzz you don't get a high or something along those lines so much a THC or something else you take these and you pretty much as feel kind of relaxed the main three health benefits and says it's basically right here on the bottle is one Alps a lot with anxiety and reducing stress so actually about a crazy day you take one of these and it does relax you and help you just kind of calm down a little bit the second thing is helps a lot with sleep there's actually been a lot of studies to show that not only doesn't help you fall asleep easier but acts your quality of sleep and the length and duration of your sleep is actually better and last but not least number three it is very very good for basing post-workout recovery now CBD comes in a bunch of informs you have off to the gummies which are these ones I'm talking about now you have tinctures you have even creams and BC topical ointment that you should put on you know different part of your body to kind of relax and calm me down these are the gummies so I'm gonna show you you see how they look and I will say this they taste great right so in case you're here is and each one contains 10 milligrams of CBD so they look like this maybe gets a little bit bigger you know than a normal gummy as you can see if they taste awesome right now in terms of the way they affected me because obviously again there's so many health benefits to CBD and I think it's something that as time goes on the whole kind of stigma around it has been dying down tremendously do because it doesn't when they give you a high or a bus right I take one I find I feel it if that's even the right word and aback I might say maybe 20 or 30 minutes maybe even less maybe about 20 to 25 minutes I guess and I just start to feel after take it very very calm they relax you know let's say if I had a crazy day it kind of quiets my mind a little bit in addition I've also found that it actually helps a lot with creativity now I think that that could be maybe the placebo effect or it could actually be the gummies sure it's kind of tough to say they noticed that after they take these again maybe about I'd say maximum a half an hour later I found that I'm a lot more creative and then you know in a non-stressful way the ideas in my mind are going like crazy right like and that's what kind of liked about this is that adds a creativity boost without it being this crazy thing cuz officer like most entrepreneurs like myself you know my mind's constantly running a million miles a second these it kind of calms me down enough where I can kind of reduce stress reduce the craziness but the same time still get a little creative boost where I can then think more clearly if that makes sense and that's one things I love about these images they're non-addictive I did a lot of research just to make sure especially for people with let's say you'd like to use CBD or even the2 pixie fall asleep I think the CBD can be a lot better and way less addictive than th e right so I do want to say that you know and that's again one thing I love about these gummies are super easy to take super fast all that kind of amazing stuff now jumping into BC the cons cuz I don't believe any products that were perfect and I do like to be very transparent on camera the first thing is in one of these it's about thirty gummies and this bottle is $35 so you're almost looking about about a little more than a dollar per gummy so we'll see it is more on the steeper and they find of CBD supplements I mean it crater there are some out there they're extremely expensive there are some they're a lot cheaper so I feel like this is although a bit more pricing than some other ones on the market I think it is still very reasonably priced and especially with something that you take once in a while which is why I suggest you do you know this is perfect for doing that you know so the price might be a little bit more expensive isn't too bad and I love the quality of these gummies the next thing I will say and there's something that again I've been doing more research on is I'm still very curious to see the long-term effects of CBD right all the research that I've done even call my walnuts has on the website you know they have there's been a ton of different studies and whatnot that's been done about the effectiveness of CBD for news and things like I mentioned this video and even other ones I mean they've even Minich smelling the CBD for a bunch of other uses however a Lodi studies still showing these short from effect so I'm very curious to see you know long-term in 10 or 20 years canopy potentially addictive can it be something that you know if you rely on it too much for sleep it kind of can creat a negative thing if let's say you try to fall asleep without it I'm big you see the the long-term research however that being said all the research that been you know looking at for the past I think that maybe we're researching it for years now maybe I think potentially even decades all the researchers come back extremely to be positive which I really really love you know but overall guys will say this for any health supplement ever you know whether it's this or even just something as simple as protein powder always consult with your doctor or physician just you know double-check on it but I think CBD honestly especially you're looking for something that calms you down safely if it kind of relax you safely so it helps you know kind of boost your creativity a little bit something that helps you you'll fall asleep and it's much for me because I do parkour freerunning have you something that really calms you down especially post-workout and helps me see your muscles recover the CBD gummies are perfect [Music]", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "SGmBjr-53Kg": "hey I'm sorry kids and welcome back to star cash games oh but wait we're bout forgetting something a little different

knocked out and I'm like you don't taste one bit of CBD in this oh my god put two in my mouth and what it says 15 well I guess I had a hundred milligrams of CBD I am I am really I'm really impressed with this no I'm not a teen on the camera I gotta work later I'm not trying to go back to sleep I took two so I was a hundred milligrams [ __ ] you need one one this is amazing and I'm done you don't I've had many gummies and you know maybe like right to the end tasting some of the CBD or in the Middle East you don't taste one lick of CBD in this it's just so sweet and good you're not usually you

for anxiety it's it's weird and i didn't even know i had anxiety until i started taking cbd i take these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one and one but it's it's a weird like the cbd thc high is a different high because cbd does something to alleviate anxiety it's sort of just like makes you comfortable with your own demise so are you like yeah we're all going to die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors feel that feel the warmth of the sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't want to i don't do this if i have anything super important to do but but just cbd oil i just find it it puts you in a great place okay like it's internal not topical internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing i've ever found for like alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that okay slow down there joe rogan there's a lot to unpack here today's video is on what does cbd feel like according to a bunch of youtubers including myself people on reddit and a bunch of people who were surveyed online for actual studies just a disclaimer this video is not in any way medical advice speak with the doctor for that i'm not advocating that you use cbd products for any condition i'm not a medical professional and people have different reactions to cbd products on an individual basis here's another guy a weight lifter that has a completely different experience than joe and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit now i was giving it one more week but i actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's 16 drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which i was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that i did experience so i am a little bit disappointed with that so he had some improvement on sleep and no real relief from what i'm assuming is inflammation associated with his weightlifting three things here one his cbd could have been fake if you're new to this channel i lab test cbd products at cbdxamin.com to see if they're real there's tons of fake or inaccurate cbd products out there too maybe dude didn't take enough cbd three even the largest surveys in research that show an overwhelming amount of cbd users benefit from cbd we're talking about research that's sponsored by companies that benefit from positive cbd research even a biased study will show that some people say cbd just doesn't help them or that it doesn't work very well people have different reactions look up the endocannabinoid system cbd stimulates your natural endocannabinoid system everyone has different tolerances and reactions it doesn't work for everyone the weightlifter did say it helped him with sleep let's see more on sleep with ben greenfield here next clip sleep like a baby like last night i got the the ring that i do my sleep squad i slept eight and a half hours last night and i take 100 milligrams of cbd i take a little bit of melatonin and i'm just out but you gotta take a lot of it and you wake up kind of groggy when you do but if you're used to that and you know like you get up shake it off 10 minutes later you're good to go i have a similar experience cbd helps me sleep i need a far lower dose and i sleep like a baby i also get a little groggy and it can take a few hours for me to really shake it off in the morning that's why i usually take it a few hours before i go to bed other people say that they wake up more refreshed some people say that cbd does the opposite when they take it at night it wakes them up that's not really typical but i have gotten a few emails from readers of my book hemp for migraine that say what the hell jeremy you said cbd helps with sleep and i'm awake at 3 a.m thanks for nothing this next one has been viewed over 12 million times a buzzfeed journalist with chronic pain took a bunch of different cbd products and rolled the clip i'd read online that people had a lot of success with tinctures so i bought a variety of kinds with various amounts of cbd and thc it was pricey at 60 but hey willing to try anything they were the most expensive method that i tried and none of them really worked for me don't feel [ __ ] about halfway through i think after repeatedly failing with the tinctures i really started to get depressed all of them failed she was trying various types medicinal marijuana products and then she tried charlotte's web which is a hemp product roll that clip charlotte's web oh my god charlotte's web i promise despite the look of my hair i'm doing much better today i actually slept like some of the best sleep i've slept in a long time which to have a pain-free sleep night is pretty rare oh i'm gonna start using this a lot more it took a couple days of tinkering with the amounts to figure out what was most effective but i highly recommend any chronic pain patients to try this first even though it's 150 a bottle which lasts me about a month it was worth every penny when i started this journey i think the thing i was most afraid of was would ingesting the cannabis affect my energy or my ability to function or my personality when in reality i was able to sleep better my headaches were less frequent which gave me more energy i just so badly want others to be able to have the chance to experience what i did so why would all these medical marijuana products fail and then a certain product from the famous strain called charlotte's web by the way you can look up dr sanjay gupta in charlotte's web for a documentary which helped launch the cbd movement with the help of a girl that suffered from seizures named charlotte i'm not going to dive into any of the seizure parkinson's or other neurological videos with cbd where people take cbd and immediately helps but you should check those out to see because it's pretty incredible back to him hemp is any cannabis drain with less than 0.3 percent thc it shouldn't get you high but i have gotten high off m products research shows that over 2 milligrams of thc can get sensitive people high or have those high effects um i felt it under that and i think a lot of people might start feeling about one milligram and some hemp products do in fact contain over two milligrams of thc that's just one other cannabinoid there's over a hundred my lab tests show over a dozen which i publish at cbdxam.com if you want to see how much thc or cannabinoids you're getting the the point here is that each product has different levels of cannabinoids so uh you can fail and fail and then find a product that is right for you with the right cannabinoids the other cannabinoids change everything everyone's different she found that a low thc product worked for her it's hemp there are other people who find that pure cbd products work better for them or some people who say that hemp or low thc products don't work at all well we'll just uh roll the next clip the thing like if i never hear the word cbd again i'll be totally happy i'm so [ __ ] sick of hearing it as a weed writer i'm so [ __ ] sick of receiving cbd products nobody wants a cbd chocolate bar i'm just [ __ ] over it um basically what people don't understand about cbd is dvd doesn't even work without thc so if you're buying cbd products on offline and it's a cbd isolate as they call it or a synthesized cbd a synthesized cannabinoid that's not going to do anything for you if you don't have a ratio to the thc you're not going to do anything so all these like rich [ __ ] at kim kardashian's [ __ ] party acting all zen they were 100 not doing full spectrum cbd products i guarantee you they were all using isolate to make the bath salt and the oils and all the stuff they were doing and they're all sitting there like wasn't she just delightful what she's saying is just not true not for everyone at least there's a lot of marijuana enthusiasts that go as far to say that cbd does absolutely nothing unless it's in a cannabis product with high amounts of thc but there's a vast growing body of research and surveys suggesting that's just not true it might be true for her and for some people but definitely not everyone some people have had bad reactions to high thc levels or can't have thc for drug tests and they do well with cbd sometimes other cannabinoids do add to the entourage effect that's found in research you can look it up cbd can be more effective with other cannabinoids but that is not to say that a high dose of pure cbd or a hemp product with very very low thc won't have positive effects but hey she says you're not going to get all zen off pure cbd and there are people that feel that way next clip this is britney jacobs it really helps calm me down and it helps me focus so i feel a little more leveled out does it take away the need for antidepressants i am not against antidepressants i think they do work they do work but for me because i was putting on a ton of weight on them and i couldn't figure out the right medication or the right dosage that it was causing more problems than i would have liked this has actually been a year since i've been using cbd and haven't had to go back on antidepressants i will say that it doesn't help with my pmdd if you don't know what pmdd is it's severe pms it is irritability mood swings crying spells pms basically on steroids in the cbd it helps a little bit it'll like calm me down and i can focus clean the house and stuff but i still have that uh get me out of my skin feeling i hate it but cbd does help that is the only drawback is that it can't tackle those hormones just like the hormones take over my diabetes my chronic illness it also nothing really stands in his way so cbd doesn't have a chance it helps a little bit but it's not the cure-all and i just want you to know that cbd will not fix your problems it won't make your stresses and fears go away it won't change your mood it'll just relax you a little bit so you're not panicking so you're not freaking out and everything but it is not the cure-all i love the stuff it helps me helped me stay off antidepressants she had a really common realistic outlook on cbd that i wanted to show because we're starting to see surveys that show a large percentage of people are taking cbd for anxiety or depression with people even getting off medications because they feel cbd is so effective first again these are just surveys always talk with your doctor about your individual conditions surveys can be misleading i've seen some people with anxiety say immediately after the first time they try cbd is this what normal people feel like sitting here just calm with no stress multiple people i've heard say say that i i could cry i'm so happy but i see far more people like brittany say hey this relaxes you but it doesn't make your problems go away it helps you manage that's about it and then if you look at reddit most people on reddit say cbd helps but it's got nothing on xanax or treatment from a doctor or see a doctor i do take cbd for stress and for me it helps relax me but if i have a huge problem like for example i'm spending massive amounts of money on purchasing cbd and lab testing cbd products so you my friend can know what's inside but will my website cbdxamin.com become profitable or will it just spend all of my money i was a firefighter before with a great retirement and that stressful job for me really was not stressful at all you have a bad day and it's over you go home no need to worry anymore anyone who's run a business knows how stressful it can be constantly chronically until you're in a spot where you can actually breathe financially and then other people have real bigger life issues illnesses and i think most people need to actually address those issues or come to terms with those because cbd won't do that for me it just relaxes me my stomach isn't so tight i can work without stressing about work but there are people out there that say cbd is more of a magical switch for them let's roll this next clip with tarmar that's when i started seeing the signs of my anxiety alleviate a lot like i remembered taking my second dose at 2 pm one day and i had been anxious up to that point and after 2 pm i got so much done i was back to normal tara i was busting out videos editing cleaning the apartment like i was getting so much done and i felt like my productive self and i continued taking it three times a day for the rest of the week and i had not had a productive week like that i'd say in about three months i was absolutely blown away by how much i was getting done and i don't know if it was a placebo effect to be honest i don't really care i was trying to be very unbiased and really not force any feelings that weren't really there but i just felt like the results were sort of speaking for themselves i was waking up every day excited to be back to work i also was suffering from i think a little bit of fatigue from something else which i will get into in another video but it was great to feel like me again and that's overall what i would say cbd oil did in terms of my anxiety it's not that it makes you feel like you're on top of the world or that you're high or anything like that it just makes you feel back to normal and for anyone that's experiencing not feeling themselves feeling back to normal is like the jackpot okay huge relief increased productivity and that word normal again to feel normal as a great achievement for a lot of people you'll hear that come up again and again let's look at an experience from a business insider journalist with anxiety and while dr heard couldn't recommend a specific dose for me she did say that 300 milligrams should be enough to feel something if i take it every day because participants in clinical trials typically take anywhere from 300 to 600 milligrams i decided to err on the side of caution and take 250 milligrams each day broken out into three doses 50 milligrams in the morning 100 milligrams at midday and another 100 milligrams at night that way it wouldn't hit me all at once first key takeaway the doctor couldn't recommend an exact dose so used a dose common in research but the research is all over the place a little context here consumer products are anywhere from five milligrams to about 160 milligrams most of them are about five to fifty milligrams research goes anywhere from five milligrams to fifteen hundred milligrams per day and that's without any serious side effects i warned people about this in my book a while back if all these people are taking consumer cbd products with low doses 25 milligrams and they feel great and also feel not so great when they sometimes take too much is the research over doing it a 2019 study found that their 25 milligram doses were just as effective as the 300 to 600 milligram doses that were previously used in research and that's the dose that this doc is recommending in the video meaning this dude may be taking way too much but nobody knows i've got a guide to dosing i'll link it below but see a doctor of course so they can tell you the wrong dose and i would say and if anything i just feel extremely tired that was the first thing i noticed that cbd was making me drowsy really drowsy dr heard said that's actually a pretty normal side effect at high doses so tired but as i discovered the next night it might also be great for hangovers see i went to a concert carly rae anyway i had some alcohol the next morning i felt great and according to dr heard that might be because cbd also has some anti-inflammatory effects oh no [ __ ] i would be super lethargic from 250 milligrams of cvd that's a lot i took 60 milligrams of pure cbd last night it was too much for me slept great woke up a little groggy i like smaller doses like 25 milligrams of a full spectrum but i do do more for hangovers cbd feels so good for a hangover cbd blocks the same serotonin receptors that cause nausea cbd research actually led to the most powerful anti-nausea medication called zofran that also blocked that receptor which i used as a firefighter so patience didn't throw up on us okay let's see what it did for his anxiety at the end i looked over my anxiety scorecard and sure enough it showed that i was feeling slightly less anxious on my last day compared to my first especially when i looked at statements like this [Music] yeah that's a big one for me and i was excited to run these results by dr heard how do you feel um to be honest i don't feel that um i i think that the biggest change that i noticed is i was just tired all the time kind of like slo-mo like lethargia that makes me feel like a little bit disassociated with reality but quite kind of in a good way and i think that that is like what made me feel a little less anxious at times taking it at night only might be the best so that this way get past the initial sedative effects um or groggy effects and then you don't have to worry about taking other things like caffeine or someone to try and keep away and what about those moments of more instant relief was that in my head or could cbd act that fast yeah absolutely for us in our studies you know people did shortly after getting cbd but again at higher doses than you had did report reduced anxiety but if there was one takeaway from our conversations it was this cbd ironically even though it's now this huge fat in our society we still don't have a very good handle on how it's working in other words we don't know so it seemed to help and we definitely don't know everything i tell you to work with a doctor but these docs are working with limited information and some of the researchers are saying that you can take way less cbd and maybe he wouldn't have felt as tired with less cbd also a week is not enough to know a month or two is minimum for most studies that use natural substances to see if they help with any condition two to three hundred milligrams will sound insane to some people look at this uh another mary jane video about anxiety i use it just for relaxation but mainly for anxiety i actually take micro gummies and they're like two milligrams each but even just that little amount i take it twice a day and i didn't think i could really get that much out of two milligrams a day but it's one of those things that when you do something regularly in small doses you definitely feel the positive effects it definitely makes me feel more relaxed during the day um but focused right it's it's more of an alert focus and it lets me just be more productive in general so i'm really thankful that i was able to find this type of a medicine and i'll continue to use it all right two to three milligrams not 200 or 300 milligrams 2 milligrams i'm a little skeptical about this one with such a low amount of cbd working but there's not enough research for me to say that she can't feel that way it must be a placebo i think that's one takeaway here you kind of need to trust yourself and how you feel because the research and the medical experts clearly say we don't know what dose will work for you i'm not one of those medical experts i'm just an insane man showing you fun cbd videos today cbd mukbangs if you will okay here's the founder of akaria well first and foremost most of the time you don't actually feel anything you're more likely to feel nothing so you're more likely to feel the absence of something than the actual feeling i'll give you an example so um so first people take cbd oil for stress and anxiety so um yes you will feel the sense of calmness and you feel the sense of relaxation and you might feel a sense of um more kind of like peaceful aliveness however the main thing you're not going to feel is you're not going to feel stress and anxiety so that's what i mean when i'm saying the absence of the feeling and not even joy but the feeling of um peaceful aliveness so the feeling of life is good that you know when you feel on a good day it doesn't necessarily mean you're like super excited it's not uh cocaine you're not gonna get into that mood or like life is good but you are gonna get in that mood of like life is good it is it is not cocaine did you see her eyes light up when she said that no it is not it's uh not a super strong medication either a lot of people describe cbd this way it's more of what you don't feel than what you do but let's see what uh gabriel santos says here definitely an increase in happiness you could say more ease you definitely feel a change in your mental and emotional state in a great way a positive way but you don't experience the like beings full-on blown and stoned um and in terms of results in my experience when i took cbd i was still motivated to do things without having to try so hard to motivate myself so other people feel happiness and motivated he went on to say that there's none of the sluggishness and anxiety or paranoia that you might feel from marijuana or high thc products a big survey actually just came out in forbes this year saying that the majority of people don't like products with a lot of thc marijuana has been bred over the last 30 years to contain more thc because that's what picks you up but it turns out that most people don't want that it's a kind of a shame because we've been breeding cannabis to get people stoned instead of for cbd and other cannabinoids that might help people more or add to the benefits of cannabis strains that are low in thc typically have more cbd and cbd also counteracts the negative effects side effects like anxiety that thc products may produce let's look at a bad trip from emma fretts my cousin gave me this jar of cbd and i don't even know the brand that was like my first experience with cbd he said just it was kind of like a gel and he said just dip your pinky into the gel and just like hold it under your tongue and it will dissolve about two hours later i basically had arrhythmia in my heart and it was like my heart stopped for a second and then it started beating really really fast it wouldn't stop and i couldn't get it to stop and i called the paramedics and i was really light-headed and i was like trying to get outside like walking through my house like i could barely walk i was just in a complete daze because my heart was beating so fast and i was just so light-headed and the paramedics came they were telling me to do all this stuff to try to slow my heart down and they were like oh it's probably just a panic attack it wasn't like they couldn't get my heart to slow down so they rushed me to the hospital when i got to the hospital they were trying to give me like all these things to slow my heart down and they couldn't get it to slow down they ended up diagnosing me with svt which is supraventricular tachycardia okay your cousin gave you some bad [ __ ] cbd products are generally well tolerated in research however there are some fake cbd products out there on the market with synthetic cannabinoids k2 spice synthetic thc don't buy fake cbd that's why i lab test every product and do a full background check to see if the company sucks let's see a happier experience here this is the polsky olympia youtuber you probably know that i have back injury and i have still a lot of pain in my back and this cbd oil just works like magic bro it just takes away the pain completely like i'm not even kidding it's it's amazing when it comes to pain okay his back feels better pain is the top reason people use cbd like rogan before i do like the muscle rubs one thing it works great for aches and pain but i got a bug bite the other day like a serious one while hiking and it did absolutely nothing for the edge that's a side note this next one is a little more complicated this is alpha m yeah a cringy youtube name but this is a good one and seems seems to be honest i don't know that first night i slept like a freaking rock was it the cbd i had no idea all i knew is that i slept like a rock i'm like damn i slept like super sound i didn't sleep longer but when i woke up i felt just like invigorated i felt like i got more sleep than i actually did and so i'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what i did boom exactly again and guess what i slept like a rock so month number one through three i took it one time a day at night before i went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety i didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis and my body it still ached and so i really didn't notice anything there so he sleeps like a rock takes it at night doesn't help with his pain or anxiety let's see him up his dose but then what i started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after i got done exercising i started taking it again and almost immediately i felt this like it was weird i felt this just like calmness and i'm like could it be like the cbd oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and i was chill i felt better and then i'm like all right i really gotta test this out and so then the third day i didn't take it and i i don't know like i said i don't know if it was placebo effect i personally don't believe it is um because i was like i was chilled i felt good i wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after i started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better i wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now i'm not saying that everything is linked i'm not saying that cbd oil cured everything but i know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that i got from plant therapy i actually upped the dosage to 33 milligrams with a thousand milligram bottle and um and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly i'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy cbd i feel better than i felt in a really long time okay this was in fact a sponsored post which you gotta watch out for alpham does have six million youtube followers he doesn't really need to lie or use a cbd product that he doesn't believe in he can get uh sponsored by any cbd brand he wants to but i don't know he's uh he's getting paid and a lot of reviewers obviously lie for the money i have affiliate links on my website they help me pay for products and lab tests i strive to be as honest as possible but you could call me a hypocrite if you'd like but the reason i do this the lab test is because i found so many fake products so many fake reviews for bad products and when you do something like spend thousands of hours researching and writing a book it's infuriating to find there are reviewers or companies completely screwing over people with false info or inaccurate cbd products fake products like you're going to give somebody with cancer dying of cancer and their doctor tells them hey it might help as a last resort go ahead and try it out and then they try that product out from a fake cbd comp anyway i just don't understand that fake products and fake reviewers you got to watch out this guy seemed to be honest but i don't know you decide for yourself let's see wheezy news someone who clearly wasn't paid to do this review and i think i had a psychosomatic response to cbd oil when i took it my heart started racing and i felt nervous and not good like immediately like like that and then last night i had a beer that had cbd in it um it was a great a beer from the great dane in madison wisconsin um good beer and i had kind of a similar reaction um not as bad not as uh extreme but then i kind of felt pretty okay and calm i definitely feel like it does something like i feel i felt calm and i felt relaxed in a weird way uh and then i slept but i it didn't help my sleep that much i still kind of woke up in the middle of night and was up a little bit didn't really have that much effect that's why i'm taking it is for my sleep um to see if it helps me sleep better because i always wake up in the middle of the night uh not always but all often times and uh it didn't necessarily work i don't know how much was in that beer i don't know what kind or like or what about it so this is actually this was actually a bad example because we don't know the dose the brand trying it once or twice isn't enough alcohol disrupts rem sleep so if you're trying cbd for sleep don't take it with something that disrupts your rem sleep too much thc can also disrupt rem sleep sleeping medications can disrupt rem sleep which is why some of them some of the medications warn you that six hours of natural sleep may be equivalent equivalent or more effective than eight hours of sleep with a medication so far research looks like cbd does not interfere with sleep cycles which is good uh unless you're wheezy news of course i checked with his channel for any updates because that was last year nothing a lot of people they have one not so great experience and that's it then they don't try it again when there are so many doses and types of cud products with different cannabinoids it can take a long time so don't give up from one quick try or take the advice of a single use review take it with a grain of salt let's uh let's see what candace lowry says about her sleep i fell asleep very quickly i did not think that would happen it was nice because it wasn't like you know if you've ever taken ambien or something like that you have this weird feeling these weird anxieties and this was kind of just like okay i'm tired and this is candace on her focus this is just a quick update i've noticed a huge difference in my focus at work and my ability to get things done and you don't feel anything it's not like you know that you're taking something it's just kind of helping you get your thoughts under control i feel like this is a theme with people with real anxiety who have taken medications i never have cbd can calm them into having clear thoughts whereas other people don't really talk about the focus as much but i don't know what do you think comment comment below and this is uh candace on anxiety and cbd uh it's the end of the week and i think that it actually helped i think that this is a great alternative for if you're just feeling a little bit of anxiety it's kind of i know that this sounds weird but if you've ever taken a xanax and they kind of just shut off that anxious part of your brain that's basically what cbd was doing for me i could feel the biggest difference with the um sublingual uh dropper and then with the nighttime things i got some of the best nights of sleep with the nighttime stuff i think it gave me a new appreciation or perspective of the cannabis industry there's no absolutely i did not feel high i did not feel out of it at all and you know when you take some sort of anti-anxiety pill medication you have this um come down which is really bad and you feel foggy and you feel out of it and there was absolutely none of that you know i think that i would continue to use some of these products so that was good pretty conclusive thoughts and she had a good experience here is someone who is less sure about cbd and anxiety this is coco is that french okay so next morning i wanted to give a little update again something that definitely i noticed is that i'm a lot better at telling myself to let things go and to calm down a bit um so like for example if it comes to sleeping i could really tell myself like okay stop worrying about sleeping like just just lay down and relax and that's something that i'm usually not really good at so you know i feel like it's really weird i have no idea if this stuff is working i'm really on the fence about it whereas i really expected to be like completely convinced and uh yeah because people are so convinced about this stuff that i thought it was going to feel crazy different and stuff and i just really don't she went on to say that she didn't know if cbd made her feel better or if it was just a good week that she had a lot of people have very subtle reactions where they just say i felt better but i didn't really feel anything strong so i don't know i don't really know why i felt better or if it was the cpd others say it's immediate and have strong relief or some people say no relief that's probably the best way to end this video you need to try cbd for yourself and you need to give it time to see if it works i could show you more videos of people who say cbd instantly is the greatest thing on earth and people who say it doesn't work for x y and z one of the most interesting things i found while researching cbd for migraines is that many migraine sufferers have an endocannabinoid deficiency your body makes its own cannabinoids they're called endocannabinoids meaning endo from within cbd stimulates that endocannabinoid system so as you can imagine people with an endocannabinoid deficiency actually look it up because this is a real thing they might feel better when cbd stimulates that system maybe that's why some people feel so alive with cbd the endocannabinoid system is responsible for energy levels and if you're stimulating something you're normally low in maybe it feels great maybe only uh someone sick can know what it feels or it can feel great when they feel just normal whereas a lot of people just feel normal all the time and they uh take it for granted the bigger question is why would anyone have an endocannabinoid deficiency oxidative stress hurts the human body and it's found to pummel the endocannabinoid system oxidative stress is basically anything that hurts the human body it can be physical stress inflammation or mental stress which later leads to actual oxidative stress or inflammation markers rising in a body that's why people take antioxidants antioxidants stimulate in the cannabinoid system so on one side you have the endocannabinoid system and on the other side you have oxidative stress or inflammation which are interlinked or basically anything that hurts the body on a daily basis this system is in constant change more oxidative stress less endocannabinoids more endocannabinoids less oxidative stress and the healthier body everyone's needs for endocannabinoids is different everyone's tolerance is different everyone's tolerance and absorption of the cannabinoids you get from outside the body like cbd thc and 100 other cannabinoids a lot of them we don't know much about will also be different what we know for sure is that people have individualized reactions to cbd and individualized tolerances and those can take time to figure out and they are not based off of the experiences of others all right i've got a free guide just an article not an upsell to uh cbd doses that i will link below it's a whole other topic and you can check out cbdxamen.com to start with knowing that you are getting real cbd in the first place and knowing what cannabinoids are in your product i will see you next time", "zD6fSHCJNJg": "[Music] you", "kuKbO3wVCoQ": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is lauren if you're new here and i do reviews of all kinds of things today i'm super excited because i'm going to review product that i've been using for a very long time a couple products actually from charlotte's web so if you are new here i would absolutely love if you subscribe to my channel and turn on the notifications so you get all of my new reviews now today just so you know this product review that i'm going to tell you about i'm also going to write about so if you want to read the article that i wrote go ahead and click in the description i'll have the link in there it'll be a little more detailed than this video because i'm going to kind of do an overview tell you how i like this stuff i've been using charlotte's web cbd products for a very long time and let's just jump right into it so i have three products here these are the three products from charlotte's web that i regularly take i have the capsules which is a cbd capsule i have the tincture the cbd tincture and i have the gummies these are the sleep gummies specifically so if you are in the market for cbd or maybe you're just doing some more research trying to figure out if cbd is right for you i'm going to talk a little bit about that at the beginning but just know i will have more information on the article in there so charlotte's web most of their products all the products that i have here are a full spectrum cbd product now there are different types of cbd products there's full spectrum there's hemp there's broad spectrum there's a cbd isolate so there are different types so just so you guys know up front these that i have today are full spectrum cbd products which pretty much just means that these products are made from more parts of the hemp plant which in my opinion gives it even more positive benefits so that's why i really like a full spectrum cbd product so if you want to learn more about the differences of full spectrum versus broad spectrum versus cbd isolate i would definitely recommend doing that but let's go ahead and tell you about this so i'm going to start with my favorite product first and that's the gummies okay so these are the sleep gummies and i love this because i personally use cbd the most often to help me sleep yes there are other benefits amazing benefits like helping with inflammation helping with stresses or anxieties helping with worries i know a lot of the times when i do get a little stressed i will use either the capture the uh capsules or the tincture as well i have the chocolate mint tincture by the way and it's so freaking good it's my first time trying that flavor um but i really like to use cbd to help me sleep and these sleep gummies also contain melatonin which is a hormone that our bodies naturally produce that helps to promote good sleep these are raspberry i'll show you guys what they look like and i take two of these gummies which it says two on the back and two gummies um there's 30 servings of two gummies so there's 60 gummies inside of here and then each serving contains 20 milligrams of hemp extract just so you guys know you can find all this information out by the way on their website um and this is what they look like so you can see they literally look just like a gummy so i'll take one now but it'll calm me down it will really if i take one during the day which i sometimes do take a gummy during the day it tastes just like a raspberry gummy um the flavor is not horrible at all i actually enjoy gummies cbd gummies um but when i take two of these which i take about 30 minutes before i go to sleep i sleep so good like when i tell you these work they freaking work so if you have trouble like getting to sleep like i do or staying asleep or getting into a deep sleep this product may be for you i absolutely love it and then another one that i really like to use are the capsules so capsules i really like the benefits of these because you don't have to worry about like versus a tincture you don't have to worry about like measuring it out or how many like milligrams you're getting the tincture in here one dropper full contains 25 milligrams of the hemp extract so like you have to have that full dropper full to make sure you're getting the 40 or the 25 milligrams in there these they're already like pre-measured out you literally can just take a capsule you don't have to worry about like putting the tincture and the tincture just means guys it's just like a little syringe and you put it in your mouth like under your tongue when you take it for about a minute and you can see that color there that's from like i think the cocoa mint because other full spectrum cbds that i've taken are just like clear with a little hint of yellow but i think that is from the cocoa mitt flavor but back to the capsules i'll take these if you know i had a really hard workout i noticed that this helps with like if i have muscle pains or muscle soreness if i experience any inflammation i have back problems so i find a lot of relief with the capsules when i take them for those things and then the tincture which is the coco mint i'll take every once in a while so i absolutely use one of these products every single day because there's actually been research done to find that you do have to be consistent so in order to get the amazing benefits of cbd you have to continue to take it and that's when i find the most benefits so i do take at least one of these products every single day to help with my sleep if i'm stressed if i have inflammation or pain i find that cbd really helps for me in these ways so i love all of these products so much and i i'm gonna put again that article below if you guys want to check out more but just so you know charlotte's web as a company i'm gonna tell you why i love this company so much they are super transparent this is why this is one of the companies that i absolutely love because they're super transparent not only about what their products are and how they work what to expect you literally any question you have about cbd you can find on their website but they're also super transparent about their process so not only how they grow their plants which they grow their own plants in here in the usa in colorado they're super transparent about it but they're also super transparent about their quality and what steps they take to ensure that their products are the best of the best quality they have all of their tests like their test results on their website you can access them to me a company should absolutely do that if they want to be trustworthy i find that charlotte's web does all of those things provides in my opinion even more information than they really have to so i 110 trust this company and their products and the quality of their products so i wanted to share because they're one of my favorites i get so many questions about cbd and what do i use cbd for so hopefully this was helpful absolutely if you guys have any questions for me or you know about charlotte's web about these products specifically they do offer way more products than what i use regularly they do offer a cbd isolate as well so if cbd full spectrum isn't something you're looking for they do have other options as well they offer different doses so i would definitely recommend finding out which product and again this is all on their website which product is going to be best for you but let me just tell you you can't go wrong with these the sleep gummies the coco mint tincture or the capsules these are ones that i use every single day and love but hopefully this was helpful if you guys have any questions again let me know in the comments and i'd be happy to help but thanks for tuning in and i will see you guys in the next video i'm actually going to be sharing even more cbd companies that i love because i do absolutely love cbd products and they've helped me in my life tremendously so get ready for that along with many many more reviews of tons of different things so i will see you guys in the next video take care [Music] you", "MK7eKWr_hCw": "hey everyone its Danielle with Lobo cannabinoids and an exciting to tell you that fat by popular

ready for fall folks I'm mentally prepared alright so today we've got another empties video I have two giant baskets full of empties today I feel like it all piled up super fast I just did one these a couple months ago but I have ten more empties to go through so I really love empties videos I find them super helpful I like seeing what people actually use you get like many reviews on the products and you can see the products that I actually use up and like have been using on a daily basis so if you want to see my trash in you're excited for this video you can give it a thumbs up if you're new here I open every Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time a reminder the heck yeah t-shirt it's available right now I'll have link down below it's only limited edition we're ordering like a set them out once they're sold out they're sold out for forever ok so I got this like container thing from ELF and PR and I've just been stuffing all my empties in it and then I have a whole other basket here that is also completely filled up so first thing I used up is this dr. gel and I said dr. gel dr. jar water fuse ultimate hydro gel so this is a moisturizer it's like a gel moisturizer hence the name smells very fresh usually I'm not a fan of gel moisturizers because on my dry skin I just like more thick and just like thick night creams I really like to feel it on my skin I like to feel like everything is fully in there you know overnight and this one I actually liked because it's like super tacky at first I really didn't like this and then the more I used it I do like it because it almost like has this sealant it's almost like a sleeping mask it has that tacky feel to it I feel like a lot of people won't like that because you definitely feel it even in the morning like you can still feel it on your face but actually liked it for that reason I don't think I would repurchase this I feel like I have other moisturizers that I like a little bit better next up is a CYO long-lasting lifeproof foundation this is my holy grail foundation I have tons of backup since they are no longer making this / CYO is no longer existing I did a whole video comparing this to the soap & Glory kick-outs foundation they're basically the exact same thing you can still buy this through the fall so if you haven't had a chance to get your hands on this everything will be linked down below but buy it now because it's gonna be gone forever by the way it is super rare for me to actually finish in a bottle of foundation cui oh I'm pretty sure is maybe one of two or worry the only one in like the last year that I've actually finished because I'm constantly trying so many foundations and like mixing things and reviewing foundations I rarely actually go through an entire bottle and see why oh I'm pretty sure I finished two bottles of next up we have this baby size of the skin Navy I make up finishing spray Scandinavia just makes me think of OG YouTube like remember when Scandinavia was the only setting spray on the market like I think they're a couple Pro makeup ones and I feel like no one talks about them anymore works totally fine it's not my favorite setting spray ever but I don't not like it I just think that I have a couple that I like the finish better I've but I had this baby one so you should have this has been a long time coming this is the aqua for healing ointment mine has like self-tanner or something on it I don't know but this is what got me through accutane my lips but then I just continue to use it because this is the best thing you can put on your lips if you have super dry lips or you just need like extra moisture on there get it in the tube not the actual lip product this is the advanced therapy healing ointment it's different than their lip product that's like actually made for your lips get this one it works miracles especially if you're going through accutane you need this for your lips it will save your life I didn't get any of like the bleeding or super super horrible chapped lips that a lot of people get on mac shame because I was using this and it is finally gone it lasted me a couple years this whole to have a hydrating micellar water from CeraVe I love this stuff I don't use it on my eyes it burns the crap out of your eyes I only use it as basically like a micellar water facial cleanser I definitely would repurchase this I love the globe gives my skin I just like using this for like a gentle micellar water kind of thing where I just wanted to get the excess makeup off love it definitely would repurchase this I have like a little bit left in here actually I have a perfume here this was from scent bird it's the Viktor and Rolf flower bomb I actually have the full size of this I love at this perfume mmm it smells like sweet and sexy but like vanilla II and not too intense I feel like this is a really good just like year-round perfume but I definitely think of like nighttime in the winter I love getting like the little travel-size ones because then you can just throw it in your purse or in your car or in your Travel make a bag or whatever so this one is totally empty another mini setting spray size that I used up the Urban Decay all nighter I've been using whoops I've been using the Urban Decay all nighter summer solstice which smells so good I feel like I'm here like tickling my nose right now this stuff smells so good it smells like coconut and sunscreen and it smells like the summer so I definitely have been loving this over just like the original one just because of the scent but I'm sure once it's in the winter I won't want to be putting like coconut and sunscreen smelling things on my face but I've been using this one and you can't go wrong with Urban Decay all nighter I'm actually pretty sure it's the same exact formula as skin and Naevia in a cave by Scandinavia so next up I have a Bree oh gee oh don't despair repair 15-minute hair cap things so this is basically like a 15 minute hair mask I don't remember this doing a whole lot like you don't remember being super impressed by it the don't despair repair line is really hit or miss for me a couple of things like the leave-in conditioner spray thing I love but the shampoo and conditioner just don't work for me so this one I definitely wouldn't purchase I got this in PR but this one I wouldn't purchase but I love their leave-in spray thing have a mascara this is definitely an empty here this is like way past you it's the Catrice glam & dawn mascara this one for a while you guys heard me talking about all the times I was layering this with my Too Faced better than sex this one has like a curved one and it really helps us separate and curl your lashes and the Too Faced better than sex is super clumpy and like volumizing so these two together I really like I would repurchase this but I have a lot of other mascaras that I really liked right now like this and slammed all them dolls that was called lash princess this is Linda the NARS climax mascara like I just have a bunch out right now that I'm trying to use up so I'm not gonna repurchase this right away but if you want a good cheap curling mascara this one or Maybelline falsies I love to I've got a giant body wash here this is the Olay ultra moisture shea butter I love this thing it makes my skin so soft it's one of the few body moisturizers where I actually feel a difference on my skin like I feel like my arms and elbows and stuff are kind of like less dry and it just smells amazing so I definitely would repurchase this I have a few body washes that I got in PR that I'm trying to get through so once I use up those would buy this again okay so I ordered pretty much everything in Amazon's new skincare line it's called ballet ballet and I was playing on do like a whole in depth video on it and I was trying out a couple of things and I was just like not it's not that I didn't like him I wasn't excited about it and I was like if I'm not excited about these why am I making a video on this I don't know let me know if you guys are like dying to see a review on that because I have all the products still I was gonna kind of more just like analyze the ingredients since in order to review a skincare product I feel like you need to test it for like at least a couple months typically so I wasn't gonna do like a full review of all the products I was just gonna do like first impressions on like fragrance and feel and then the ingredients but I don't know just kind of decided against it but I did ease up there micellar facial cleansing wipes these are totally average I definitely wouldn't repurchase them they don't take off makeup as good as the Neutrogena ones and they're kind of just like blah another cleansing wipes I used up is the Coach endo cleansing spa water kathleenlights raved about these and I do really like how well they take off my makeup the only thing is like the texture of the wipe there's something about it that just makes me cringe like I feel like I need to squeeze a stress ball I don't know what it is I think it's cuz it's kind of like that staticky like it snags on your nail I don't know it's a little bit more dry and like staticky than the Neutrogena wipes so the texture of the wipe drives me a little insane but it works really well it takes off your makeup super well your waterproof eye makeup like it does remove things super well I just probably wouldn't repurchase because they just make me look used up the whole thing of mac fix+ I just always have this sitting on my make up station table thing because I use this to wet my eyeshadow if I want to try and make it pop I like to set my face with that I use it if I have no makeup on and I just want my skin to look really glowy I'm like halfway out of this one too this is the coconut one but you can't go wrong with mac fix+ if you just need something that's kind of like multi-purpose it doesn't irritate my skin it gives you a really pretty glow I don't think it's super long-lasting like it's not gonna make your makeup stay on better it just kind of like melts all the products together holy grail right here the ordinary rosehip oil I probably go through one of these maybe every few months so they do last me pretty well for something that I use every night and I use quite a bit of it I feel like these lasts a while so I got a few of these as backup when I was in London they had an actual DCM store and then DCM just sent there like entire line of skincare products so I've just been testing out a ton of new stuff from them which is exciting but the rosehip oil amazeballs if you have acne scarring or you just need a really good moisturizer if you have dry skin this is life-changing helps with the texture on my skin acne scarring the dryness it's one of those products that I will forever repurchase because I've seen the results from it and it's like ten bucks have to toothpaste says here toothpaste toothpaste DS one is from crest it's their 3d white whitening therapy I think this was just on like a major sale and I needed something for my travel bagg so I got this do not love this toothpaste it's super thick and it just it's like well it's not that minty I don't feel like it whitens that well consistency of it is way too thick so this was definitely a fail but I love the Colgate optic white one of my favorites the Express white is amazing I always repurchase these I have two powders here from when I did my powdered declare video I kind of just realized like I'm never gonna use the bottom of these so I think it's time to trash it but this is the Physicians Formula one for a while I was mixing this with my under-eye powder and this is just the translucent airbrushed pressed powder really love this powder either as a face powder or for the under eyes it's just super pretty house good coverage and then the Maybelline fit me powder in 100 this I haven't touched in I don't you know probably over a year and I don't think I'm gonna be finishing this off anytime soon I used this when I had oily skin more so I'm just going to toss both of these since they're pretty much done this is the tea tree oil cooling foot scrub it's okay I feel like you could just use any kind of exfoliator and get the same results I feel like the biggest difference with your feet is when you use like one of those real intense scrubby things and blanking on the name right now but the ones that are like a rock basically and you just like scrub the crap out of your heels that doesn't have enough grit it's almost like too gentle to really do anything on your feet so wouldn't repurchase this I think I got this from alta like a few years ago it's taking me a while to go through have this tasha harper resurfacing serum sample it's a sample it's a resurfacing serum so i feel like i can't really give you my thoughts on it yet because you know it was like a one-time use kind of thing taught to harper is super freaking expensive though so i was excited to get this as a sample and then I have this diva curl melt into moisturizer might know Milton to moisture matcha butter conditioning mask I did like this one it was moisturizing I got a couple uses out of it but I wouldn't repurchase just because pretty sure the full-size is pretty expensive and I have a L'Oreal mask from the drugstore that is like my Holy Grail it's the ultra Repair in like the yellowish gold tub so it's hard for me to justify high-end hair mass when I have that one that's super affordable and it's amazing this is one of those things that I used when I had oily skin and I'm just tossing it because it is literally almost empty it's the bodyshop tea tree skin clearing lotion I use this for a while when I had oily skin and I liked it cause it was just like lightweight I didn't feel like it was breaking me out anymore and I talked about this like years ago on my channel so this one is a goner and then I have one of my gold I'm a sake like these are always in my empties videos so they usually use like a couple month probably right now I'm also going through the pixie eye masks which I really like but these ones you can get on Amazon they're super cheap they're fun to put on because they're gold and they do help with like the moisture under my eyes so within the past month I want to say I did a video on cleansing balms I talked all about the best and worst cleansing balms drugstore and high-end and here's the cosmetics bye bye makeup not a fan of this one also smells just like real chemically and real off there is a little bit left in here but like I'm over it okay taking me years to get through this thing we definitely wouldn't repurchase this I have other ones I like way better the clinic take off the day is amazing the Physicians Formula matcha amazing also in that video a lot of you guys commented saying I need to try the good molecules cleansing balm Malory when she stayed here brought it I tried it and it is amazing took off literally all of my eye makeup and everything so I'm definitely gonna be purchasing that cleansing balm as well and that one I think is more affordable had a sample size of the Marc Jacobs youthquake it's a Hydra full retexturizing gel cream I really like this for the few days that I tried it three days out of the sample it smells like coconut smells amazing and it is a gel but it does feel like kind of thick and creamy like I still felt it on my face in the morning which personally I really like I hate when my moisturizer sinks into my skin fully and then when I wake up I feel like dry and like I didn't wear moisturizer at all I really don't like that I love when I wake up and my skin still feels super moisturized and like plump I feel like things are working throughout the night so this one I don't know I would debate getting I need to look at the ingredients I used up the bath and Bodyworks mint and Moss hand soap here this is just one they're foaming hand soaps I always stuck up in these when they go on sale right now I have an orb a hand soap I'm going through but usually I'll use a bath and Bodyworks ones they're fine they smell really good they like linger on your hand the scent and the mint Moss smell is just very tree-like and minty and mossy and things right and last few things are more like lifestyle cleaning products some home stuff's candles so this is the Bath and Body Works sweater weather this one obviously isn't like totally burned through but the wicks just stopped working like I'll light it and they just go out so I'm trashing it that usually doesn't happen to me with Bath & Body Works candles so I'm not sure what was going on there but I love the scent of sweater weather I've run this throughout the year not just in the fall this is like probably one of my favorite Bath and Body Works sense it does smell kind of cologne EBIT it still smells like fall and I'm like I'm getting ready for fall folks I'm mentally prepared next I have a gained detergent here I love gein gein lingers on your clothes works amazing I really love trying different laundry things it's like I don't know I feel like I approach laundry products the same way I do with makeup where I'm like I need to try them all you know but gain I do continue to repurchase I have the pods right now I like the game pause buy also like the liquid detergent have the cascade platinum pods here these a couple times in my dishwasher have not fully melted which is weird I don't know what was happening in those times but all the other times they worked but they did not fully melt a couple times so I don't know if I would repurchase these I like the Target brand ones up-and-up brand a little bit better and I think they're also more affordable I feel like I got these on sale at like Walgreens or something sometimes if I'm on Walgreens buying makeup a lot of the times we'll welcome to their coupon section and their sales section and sometimes they have really good sales on laundry detergent and home things and like dishwasher stuff so just double check because sometimes you can't get super good deals at the drugstore on these kinds of things if they're not on sale they're way more expensive than like Target and Walmart and stuff but if they are you can get really good deals forgot these ones I've to Old Spice amber deodorants nothing new here these are always in empties because I have a back stock of like 50 of these since I bought them on eBay and Amazon and I heard they were getting discontinued I do want to try mirror dry let me know if any of you have done it Malory kind of like talked me into it if you have issues with sweat under the arms and like smelling and things mirror dried literally just like kills your sweat glands under your arms I've been thinking about doing it let me know if any of you guys have tried it alright and then ending it off with some CBD here so I've talked about hemp bombs in the past I do really like their gummies these taste really good and my boyfriend has been taking the melatonin CBD gummies at night just to like help sleep I took it one of the days when Mallory was here and I was super groggy the whole next day these aren't the melatonin ones so just a regular ones I was super groggy so if melatonin makes you feel like that I wouldn't get those ones but these are just the normal ones then I have the highest oils the 4000 milligram pen balms is expensive but I would literally pay anything to like have my pain reduced a little bit so for me it's worth it but I also tried the premium Jayne CBD oil mint flavor at this month I was kind of just seeing if there were other brands that were like a little bit cheaper than have bombs that were still really good this one I feel like didn't work as well for me and the mint flavor is really weird it has this like smoky undertone to it I don't know is kind of gross but I also did just get the 300 milligrams this is 300 milligram this is 4,000 so a little bit different I kind of just wanted it to test like the flavor and stuff with this because of the flavor I don't think I would buy the more intense version of this I think I'm just gonna stick with hemp bombs but I don't know if you have any other CBD ones for pain like chronic pain and I'm not talking about like just relaxing and feeling I need like the intense stuff like four thousand milligrams if you have any good suggestions for ones that are a little bit more affordable than have bonds but that are still really good let us know down below alright so that was all of my trash from the past couple months if you guys like empties videos don't forget to give this video a thumbs up I'm gonna have the products linked down below in the description box you wanna check anything out but I also have makeup details from this in a foundation Friday which I'm pretty sure will be up before this video I love you guys thanks for watching me talk about my trash today see you in my next video bye [Music] [Applause]", "MhqFEGrrvgQ": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be talking about one of the ways that I use to cope with my anxiety in my OCD I'm sure some of you know that I do suffer some pretty pretty severe OCD as well as anxiety and what that comes you know the fun of depression and all that so one a very very kind of controversial product that is out there that people use and I have tried for a couple months now that is CBD oil or gummies if you're interested in seeing how that works and the effects and all that and if it's worth it please stick around so first I just want to say kind of the obvious I think we all have at one point or another either been around marijuana before or used it I am not afraid to admit that I have used it recreationally before it does help with anxiety sometimes it did make me paranoid I'm not gonna lie I am all four of our creational use medical use whatever you want to do with it as long as you're not being stupid while you're using it why not now if you live somewhere like I do which is the state of Ohio where recreational marijuana is not legal medical marijuana is but unfortunately in Ohio it is so pretty difficult to get a script from a doctor for medical marijuana if you live somewhere like that like I do there is the alternative of using CBD oil or CBD infused things such as gummies which is what I use now I just want to say right off the bat you should always ask your doctor first if stuff like this is okay if you are taking any kind of medications such as anti-anxiety antidepressants any kind of psychiatric or non psychiatric drug that you are on you should always ask your doctor first to make sure that there won't be any kind of drug interactions as CBD oil is not FDA regulated to my knowledge at least the one that I have it does not say it is approved by the FDA just like any other supplement you buy at the store I got mine off well I didn't buy it for myself my boyfriend was kind enough to buy mine for me I don't know if you got it off of Amazon or if you got it off the actual website but I know you can buy it off of Amazon what I have there called CBD gummies and I will that's just the brand that it is these are them and I'll put a picture up here too if I can find one so you can see a little bit better I know there was kind of a glare on that now when you take it out they look like this they look little gummy bears and they taste pretty good I'm not gonna lie it does have a little bit of like an herbal II kind of medicinal taste aftertaste to it it's not bad though it really it honestly just takes it tastes like you're taking a dump Eve item in like they taste good they just have a little bit of a weird aftertaste there's different colors in there but honestly all the colors really taste the same there's pink blue orange and green they all taste the same I just saw the name of it they are called hemp bombs I don't know if you can see that again I'll try to put a picture up here hemp bombs high potency 450 I'm not exactly sure what that means again my boyfriend bought these for me I don't know if they have different potencies but they are all called hemp bombs CBD gummies they are kind of expensive I'm not gonna lie a pack of these it came with 30 and I'm pretty sure it was about 45 to 60 dollars I know it was not cheap they are really expensive especially if you're someone that uses them every single day I don't think unless you have the funds for it I do not recommend this as a daily supplement in replaced of anti-anxiety medications if that's the kind of help that you are seeking unless you have the funds spread if you do more power to you and I applaud you I do not I do take anti-anxiety medication prescribed by my doctor but I do use these as a little bit of an aid when I need it probably take one of these once or twice a week especially when I'm having a really bad day or feel the arms out of a panic attack coming and I've already taken my anti-anxiety meds and I know I cannot take another one for about six hours or so this is a good replacement now the effects it does tell you on the bottle that you should not drive and you shouldn't operate heavy machinery after taking the medication it isn't over-the-counter supplement however like anything that's just something they put on the bottle for liability breathers the thing with CBD gummies the reason that you can buy them over-the-counter or you can buy them online especially in places where recreational marijuana is not legal is because it has zero THC THC is the compound in marijuana that gives you that high happy feeling like you're on cloud nine that that thing that's what THC is the reason that these are legal to buy is because it is made from the same plant but it does not have any THC in it that being said I will tell you at least for me I'm sure it affects different people you know in different ways for me it definitely does still give me that high feeling it's just not nearly as intense I definitely would not drive after taking one of these but again that's just me everyone's different I have noticed that when I take them they do make me extremely tired which could be a good thing if you're somebody like me that has trouble sleeping I have taken these at like you know to three o'clock in the morning when I am why do we cannot relax and I just want to go to sleep I will take one of these and I gotta tell you probably within about thirty minutes 45 minutes I am out like a light it's just it just affects everybody differently now there are lots of different brands that you can use I have used this specific brand only because the ones that I looked into before stumbling upon this one they all said that either may contain or did contain some kind of true night I'm not sure why but I do have a pretty severe tree nut allergy so I could not use those this was that was the sole reason I picked this brand all the prices are pretty similar it looks like the flavors are pretty similar they all kind of like have like a fruity flavoring but that was my reason for picking this brands because it did not have any kind of thing like that in its allergy statement now one thing that I've noticed that is really good about these is if I take it when I can feel a panic attack coming and say I don't want to take one of my you know my anti-anxiety pills or you know it's too soon for me to take another one I have noticed that if I take these it either diminishes completely or leaves at the very least it subsides the symptoms of a panic attack if I take it in time or even if I take it in the middle of one it at least takes the edge off of it the only downside is it doesn't last very long the longest I have noticed is last thing when it hasn't completely put me to sleep is about two hours now that may seem like a long time and if it does good if not you might just have to take another one although I don't think so it does say that you can take one to two companies daily neither during the day or at night it doesn't really seem to matter I haven't noticed a difference at whether I take it in the morning or at night it affects me exactly the same maybe at night it makes me a little bit more tired just because I'm tired from the rest of the day I haven't noticed any difference between taking in the morning versus at night so lastly I just want to touch on some of the benefits that comes with these CBD gum bezoar oil they all have the same kind of benefits and I have researched it it's not just this brand they all kind of have this umbrella list of benefits that it does have I'm going to read it off of the bottle so it says it's a mood enhancer pain relief alleviate stress calming relaxation natural sleep and healthier lifestyle I don't really know about the healthier lifestyle one I don't really know how CBD gummies can promote a healthier lifestyle maybe you know indirectly if it helps you with other things you could eventually have a healthier lifestyle but as of everything else that I also read online that if you're someone like me that has chronic stomach or digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome or IBS or any other kind of digestive upset I have noticed it does kind of help with that especially if you're someone like me that you know gets like really bad stomach cramps for no reason yay IBS it does actually kind of help with that because it is a pain reliever so I have noticed when I've you know been in the midst of a panic attack and my panic attack unfortunately that triggers an IBS episode it does alleviate the symptoms of both of those and it's wonderful so now that we've gone over the pros I think it's important to also touch on the cons one of the very big cons is the cost it is very expensive like I said before the other con would be that when you do take it at least for me I do get extremely drowsy I do get kind of that high feeling even though you are not actually high there's no THC in it it does kind of give me that same feeling and I'm sure that affects other people differently but that's how it affected me my boyfriend took one he felt the exact same way it's not bad you don't feel you know super high or out of it but it does kind of give you that similar feeling and if you want if you don't want that feeling if you're somebody that maybe doesn't like that feeling of being high or super drowsy it may not be for you but you are also going to get those kind of side effects if you also take the prescribed medication all those medications do have those side effects drowsiness feeling weak that's just something that comes with any kind of medication or supplement so those were the only cons that I could really think of is the price and the feeling that you get with it which if you're somebody that likes that feeling I guess it could be considered a pro too but yeah those are the pros and cons of using the CBD oil that I have found again this is the brand that I use there hemp balms CBD gummies 450 milligrams I believe yet some milligrams they say high potency they taste really good I really like um I've been using them for a couple of months I don't use them that often I get looking like I said I use them about once or twice a week just to alleviate the symptoms of say a panic attack or I really cannot sleep alright well I hope that was helpful to you guys I hope you enjoyed the video I am

how I pronounce it okay so there's a lot all these products that claim CBD does things to help your body lift your spirits improve your performance but all kinds of claims are is there any research to back this up very very little so CBD is one of the components of the cannabis plant cannabidiol and society has jumped very far ahead of the science CBD is still classified as a schedule 1 drug because it's part of the cannabis plant so that we're very restricted in our ability to study it in a carefully controlled way and we desperately need to catch up with the public because they're using it for absolutely everything should be clear the CBD does not have the brain effects that THC does when you think about people smoking pot it doesn't you don't get high using that at all so it acts very differently in the brain it doesn't produce any of the intoxication that THC does that's the active component to the cannabis plan and there's some intriguing preclinical studies showing that it could have potential health benefits but again the science has not caught up with everything Americans are using it for at the moment if you go into a drug store or if you go into a standalone pop pharmacy and buy something with CBD in it is it safe well the problem is we don't exactly know what it really contains so CBD alone does not seem to have a lot of side effects which is a which is a plus even a pretty high doses I've given in the laboratory at high doses and we don't see a lot of side effects however because it's not regulated appropriately we don't know what you're buying it might have THC in it it might have active form pharmacological ingredients we don't know because it's not regulated so you know marketers are selling these products they say about 30 percent of the products you buy on the internet that say they contain CBD do not contain CBD at the levels they say so you don't know what you're getting acutely we're not worried about its side effects but what is distressing to me is the fact that the FDA and the DEA are still unclear about is it a supplement is it a medication and the rulings have not come down from the higher level of government about what it is well then why and why isn't there more research I mean why this to this plant has been around successfully right European settlers got here what why don't why don't we know more so for 25 years I've had all the regulatory pieces in place to study cannabis and its components but I have to give it because it's schedule one by the DEA I have to only study it in very carefully controlled ways in the laboratory I collect the butts that people smoke from the cigarettes and store them in a safe permanently because they're considered Schedule one which is the one like heroin exactly in case people are still interested in CBD is it more effective to swallow it or is it more effective to rub it on your hand it's an excellent point because whatever that's the other thing that that I think the public isn't informed about so smoking vaping rubbing it on your body taking a pill I'll give very different pharmacological effects extremely different so you buy something that just says CBD if you rubbed on your skin you're gonna get a totally different effect then swallowing it are smoking it so that just something stamp CBD is is not meaningful is there anything that CBD has been clinically proven effective yes so the only thing that has made it through the careful placebo controlled studies is the use of CBD for severe forms of childhood epilepsy and so that's called epidemics and there the data demonstrate you know in a way that makes scientists happy that it does help for that that's the only thing it's been approved for and tested for so we're still in the early stage so waiting Congress okay dr. Margaret Haney thank you so much for joining us appreciate that thanks so much you you", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to see more reviews and if you've tried wild please leave a comment below

was a big year for our award-winning and industry best-selling gummies so how do we improve on our cbd gummies done right innovation manufacturing and capacity hereby 2021 will be an even bigger year on this episode of the cbd university podcast and it starts right now i'm joe agustinelli host of the cbd university podcast if you're a returning listener thank you once again for coming back to our podcast if you are a new listener we are glad you found us on your favorite podcast platform of choice we hope that you will subscribe to our podcast wherever you get your podcast and don't forget full episode videos available on the global widget youtube channel and the youtube channels of our brands hemp bombs and nature's script well last year was a big year for our cbd gummies with the debut of our new and improved cbd gummies in july they were named the csp retailer choice best new product in the cbd and hemp category in 2020 and our hemp bombs brand leaves the convenience store space with over 60 of the market share according to the latest iri spins data plus stay tuned to our podcast for a special edition episode in the near future on the launch of a new non-cbd gummy variant focus on health and wellness in response to industry trends but before we get to all of that how do we top everything that went on in 2020 and my two guests here today will tell you all about what's in store for the year ahead when it comes to gummies and i welcome our chief operating officer celine baltagi unveiled vice president of white label and raw materials chad levitt thanks for both coming back to the podcast good to be here good to be here celine we'll start off with you when it comes to formulating and manufacturing our gummies it all starts way before you get the finished product in the bottles as you can see some of them uh here on our that's the nature script brand that's the hemp bombs brand and we'll talk a little bit about the white label opportunities when chad joins us but before we even get to that step we've got to have the right formulation and we're going to have the right technology and processes and that's something we are expanding on as we go into 2021 and something we expanded on in 2020 that's exactly joe and and we it all starts with the recipe it all starts with a team that we have our own recipes in house we create our own recipes and then the formulation team is exceptional they take pride in everything they do and then our gummies is just coming off the press i mean they're delicious they're just like we have capacity we're adding equipment and we'll talk about that a little bit as well we continue to expand and tell you enough about our team and we do we have some behind the scenes videos available on our youtube channel that takes you behind the scenes of the gummies and how they are are made um hey you talked a little bit about the machines two machines so far a third one just uh coming online exactly not too long ago so we have three gummy lines and then we're ordering a fourth one so that will be coming in very soon in the next video so we're expanding our capacities and then it's exciting it's exciting that we're we're investing in the business we continue to grow our gummy business is great as you mentioned earlier the award-winning gummies so it's all exciting 2021 is going to be a great year for us and chad another reason for success in the gummy market and then coming over to the white label is the endless possibilities because of that capacity so when we talk about capacity i mean what uh you're smiling already yeah so go ahead tell us all about it and how it really affects the white label and wong raw ingredient site well what it allows us to do is with this capacity in capacity starts and let's back up even more so than that let's back up to the formulations team the commitment that the company has made to formulations and just in terms of the people itself our team has actually doubled in size over the course of the last like 60 days so with that happening that just gives us even more possibilities and where that was that born of well we are having great conversations with a number of companies out in the industry now and starting to look at you know in the past like hey let's reverse engineer let's look backwards at some of the products that you have and maybe people that are having challenges because of their current supplier has capacity issues and so what does that mean it means that things that turn around at six months at other facilities turn around in 30 to 45 days here and that itself combined with the low mo cues that we require on on you know per gummy say a private label formula mix those together with that increased capacity sling talks about the third machine that's online where the fourth is being ordered you add all that together what happens is our capacity we're not near our capacity but it allows us to kind of continue to say yes let's look at these other other opportunities yes it allows us to expand and look at other vitamins other cannabinoids other you know different sizes shapes and really the speed and efficiency of which we operate and also combined with the years and years of experience specifically gummy experience from our formulations team it really has allowed us to kind of grow in this market and what we've seen really since the contract manufacturing team has come online really just a little over six months ago in a no other word other it's just exploded and we've really been fortunate it's been a great ride and been really enjoying to be a part of this and when we talk about capacity just to put it in perspective how does it work with the manufacturing team like how many gummies can we make on a maybe daily basis weekly basis monthly basis how i mean is this like willy wonka's chocolate factory we have the machines running all the time and the machines are actually yes we continuously run our machines and like chad mentioned we still have capacity but we are getting more capacity in order to prepare for anything that's upcoming any additional business any new business but on average a little over over 1.5 million gummies a day you know with the fourth machine coming in it'll be over two million gummies a day so that's that's gonna allow us to do all kinds of things so it's it's exciting it's a lot of capacity available and and we're looking forward to fill all those machines and maybe order a fifth one so yeah okay let's see what happens it would be awesome yeah that's right it's just exciting times it's exciting times you have three machines and you have all these capacities and you have fourth one on on on the way on the way so why not and what kind of certifications and or state licenses are needed for you know making your own gummies i know there's some things in the work but what so far is like the key license or certification to have so we can be doing this on a daily basis but we know in in 2020 the florida hemp permit so we we already secured that we have our audits already done we have the florida hemp certificate that we can make edibles in our facilities so we're proud of that we continue to work on additional certifications as they come on board we'll be talking about those and for more on uh stuff from the state of florida you can take a listen back to episode 44 holly bell the cannabis director from the state of florida appeared on our podcast just a couple months ago but her information is still very pertinent as to what we talked about even though we're a few episodes down the road once again that's episode uh 44. so train on top of capacity the ability to control that process from the formulation to the time it gets on the store shelves um really speaks to the vertical integration and efficacy across just about any brand uh or type of gummy correct yeah it is you said it great um really in terms of that vertical integration the fact that our company we actually extract material and have the capabilities to do so that that really means that that material once it's received to us we'll say biomass form you know which is just the raw hip itself that's been milled down once we receive that material it won't lead this facility until it's got a label a bottle a shrink you know a cap it's ready to go and then it's been tested you know in terms of a third-party iso lab that's given the go ahead and very verified that's within a certain spec you know when you work with products that are you know in the past what's been traditionally understood in the market is what's acceptable in cbd specifically is is gummies can be really kind of come in any form and what i mean by that is it can come in any shape and size but in how it's even manufactured you could spray the material which is literally you're spraying and coating the gummies itself and you know global widget realized that hey this is a great opportunity to us for kind of saying let's take a little different approach a much different approach i should say kind of line more with cpg consumer packaged goods in the industry let's infuse these things so what does that mean ultimately at the end of the day it means that you get from these super wide variances on a per piece basis to something narrow that's more like 10 and i'm talking about why like you're talking like it could be 20 and 30 percent you could get a gummy it could just be as low as you know you get a 10 milligram gummy it could be as low as like five milligrams as high as 15 when sprayed on average you know that variance goes from like nine to 11 you know when you're looking at an infused product that is the beauty of having infused and that means that the customers getting a better experience they're getting more consistent product so therefore they're getting the real effects and the real benefits you know that they feel that they're getting from the cbd itself it's lime how important is it to find the right balance of ingredients in the formulation so the gummies are produced to our very high quality standards especially when it comes to new machines obviously it probably takes a little bit to get the look and feel of the machine and how gummies come out correct exactly i mean we our machines typically any industry you put a brand new line inside your facility it takes you 30 to 60 days to get it up and running we are fortunate to have an exceptional engineering and maintenance team and our our machines as they come in within three weeks we're up and running but you have to experience in each each line is a little bit different even though they're made similar and we're having redundancy to make sure our equipment's similar yeah as as we move forward but it's definitely from cooking it at the right temperature producing it cooling it through the cooling tunnels as it comes out coating it whether it's wax coated or whether it's sugar coated it all has to be at the right time the right place and then drying it and making sure that the gummy when it comes out it's ready to be put in a package that is going to be ready to be consumed at some point in the future that is the form is correct the molds the shape everything else and the taste and texture so we take product every step of the way and that doesn't happen by accident you have to test it you have to try it you have to dial it in so it takes a little bit of time to get it up and running once our lines are up and running they are consistent every one of them and finally chad what's the feedback you get when people realize that our gummies are made exclusively in-house and when you have them here they see the technology and the innovation and maybe even some folks who have been here in the past and they come in now and they're like whoa this is complete i mean it's completely different from when i first walked in the back when i started here in 2019 to today right what's it like for the folks who are here that you're bringing around you know we we still take on visitors and we obviously had a tour even as recently as this past wednesday and the the comments that we get from folks really just you guys really have something that's quite unique in this industry and what that is is capacity we're talking guilt on this one this is what the focus of this conversation is but there's capacity in other areas too so it becomes a wow effect when you look at the the capabilities of the company from a production standpoint from a distribution standpoint from an you know extraction standpoint we really kind of are far superior to what we see really that's well received well expected in the market there's just a difference and you know people are back there they're working every single day i mean we are cranking i mean you go back there there's we have three lines working we have another on the way there's five five uh bagging machines right now with three more on the way there you have multiple sorting lines and packaging lines as it relates to the bottles so this is just related to gummies my friend so this is like we've got so much more to offer too in addition to that it's exciting but these things along with what we are working on in terms of a compliance and regulatory standpoint that is what really kind of sets us apart because we're looking not just what we were yesterday but how do we become better for everyone going forward as well and we'll have more on that topic in a episode coming up in the very near future with our chief compliance officers we talked about some of the labeling and packaging initiatives being undertaken here in 2021 to comply with the ever-changing industry and some new regulations around the country so tune in for that but for now i want to thank both you for uh coming on the podcast i think we'll be having both of you back throughout 2021 it's a lot of exciting stuff going on absolutely

botanicals products to a lab to see if they're real I'm going to show you the lab results what's in them and the price breakdown Bluebird botanicals is the it's a different company and I'm not in any way affiliated with this company for those of you who don't know me I was a professional firefighter and then I quit to work on a health website for migraines called migraine key calm there was a lot of research on CBD and epilepsy and epilepsy treatments were commonly used for migraine one thing led to another ended up writing about CBD on my green key and then I even wrote a book called hemp for migraine it's helped a lot of people CBD and understanding than the cannabinoid system not me I just gathered the research for people the book has great reviews as of now but I review a lot of shitty CBD companies so I expect to get some bad reviews from angry CBD companies soon here what's this got to do with Bluebird botanicals I wrote about Bluebird in my book and even before that I'm migraine key calm I searched years ago for a CBD company that was a good price and transparent at the time and I spent months doing this it was way before CBD was federally legal Bluebird was the only company that I found that posted multiple lab results on their website now lab results are everywhere but I would caution that a lot of the worst CBD companies that I've tested now also give lab results that are not quite accurate [Music] Bluebird was a real pioneer of transparency in the CVD industry they even put a little plus next to their milligrams of cannabinoids on their bottle to let you know that it has more cane monoids and it's not exactly accurate no companies are for full spectrum products and they made it easy to find their batch number and their lab tests online to see exactly what you're getting but let's get to each of those lab tests so we can verify if Bluebird is honest this is gonna be real quick real fast but links to all of these are below if you want to dive in and compare the first one is a THC free hemp extract for 30 bucks they claim 500 milligrams of pure CBD and our lab tests found 500 in 45 milligrams of pure CBD just CBD no THC it's eight point nine percent more extremely accurate it's for people that just want CBD and don't like or are sensitive to THC or can't fail a drug test or don't want THC period price per milligram of CBD is five point five cents at 30 bucks this is amazing 15 cents is average and they make the same formula in bulk and as you buy more the price goes down to 3 cents living which is cheaper than any CBD that I've tested but you got to spend money for that onto the hemp classic this is their entry level their beginner bottle of full-spectrum you know for scared people they claim 250 plus milligrams of cannabinoids and we found 255 milligrams of cannabinoids it doesn't get better than that here's the breakdown and you can see that even their weakest blend is a good full spectrum bottle meaning it has all the other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG those are popular found in premium brands like Charlotte's Web the most popular CBD company so this is a real competitor to that Charlotte's Web is best known for their case study on epilepsy but people now use it for pain and lots of different things it's it's all-around popular and blue-ber products have the CBC and CBG and it only goes up in the stronger blends okay this one is a little more expensive it's 11 cents per milligram average is 15 cents but you get all those other can annoyed in there too again you can buy in bulk it gets cheaper but I wouldn't buy this one in bulk because why not just move up to the concentrate it's cheaper it's stronger let's move on to the concentrate alright this is the classic concentrate which I also tested also known as the 6x for six times stronger I bought this little bottle it's smaller and still stronger well obviously it's six times stronger they claimed 500 milligrams plus of cannabinoids and our lab found 575 milligrams of cannabinoids champion expiry and all right now that's actually acceptable for the CBD industry but remember they add a little plus to it and then they provide the lab results in addition to that which are almost identical to mine so yeah that's accurate that's a lot of CBC and CBG which might be what makes that Charlotte's Web special if you compared it just the milliliter to milliliter of the Charlotte's Web extra-strength this one has more CBC and CBG and bluebirds cheaper price is nine cents per milligram and that's great for a full spectrum extract like this but again you can buy it in bulk and it goes down to less than five cents per milligram which is excellent I would say if you wanted something cheaper you could do like Lazarus Naturals I just only have one review of that but they don't have everything that Bluebird has to offer and I'll show you why in a second but first I want to show you bluebirds have complete concentrate this one has a lot of the other cannabinoids that you lose when you heat the bottle it's rich in CBD a that's the acid of CBD which turns into CBD when you heat it I'm not going to go into the science of this frankly there's not enough research on it for me but I will say that a lot of people prefer CBD a to CBD so this is that and they claim to have 500 plus milligrams of total cannabinoids what at our lab tests find over 584 milligrams again they provided a lab test that was almost identical to this one it's full spectrum with a ton of CBD a and then lots of other cannabinoids it doesn't look like much next to all this CBD a but this is a really good mix of cannabinoids now price per milligram of CBD it's a little more expensive 18 cents per milligram of CBD but they're selling a mix of CBD and CBD a here which is not included in this chart so I made a little chart here that includes both and it's under 10 cents per milligram if you combine the CBD a and CBD that's excellent it gets even cheaper yes all right but you should know that it's a lot more expensive just to produce CBD a and most of the companies that claim to have CBD a don't okay in blue burns botanicals as a company i've talked him up but their reputation is just immaculate a plus rating with the Better Business Bureau alright a five-star rating on Glassdoor you want to find a good company find happy employees and you'll find a good company 2018 top pick by consumer labs.com as a matter of fact this may be alright Consumer Labs is like me they test products the only difference is that they have a great reputation and our world-renowned and nobody knows who I am except for you watching this video but we're the same I love this year up to 40% off for disabled low income and vets they've had that for a

company you know roundup that toxic Monta Monsanto shed and their company really had a big part of the political fight for the legalization of hemp their founder is the VP of US hemp roundtable I remember they emailed me Congrats hemp is now legal and this would be obviously before it was legal and I checked Google and there was nothing in like an hour or two later the news finally broke on Google that hemp had become legal but they were on the inside they're making it happen mm-hmm oh yes they earned my CBD examine authenticity award that's more important than all these other [ __ ]

Daisy confused the first words I ever said on film look at my other reviews I am very harsh very critical and if there's anything wrong with the CBD company I'll let you know and Bluebird is like an angel among mostly opposite of angels demons an angel among CBD demon companies I would go ahead and stop here you did they should be paying me for this you know how many customers I've referred to them this this reviews over", "fx-Sl40vVGc": "you guys in IBM either drive a semi canal it is Monday I look so tore up right now what does the face look like this why do i why wait eglee I'm like feeling weird right now cuz I'm like stressed but really not and he's just Monday feelings where it's like I know I have so much to do this week also I haven't done my planner yes so honestly I think that's kind of what's got my head because I feel like I have so much I need to do but yet I have nothing planned out so I'm gonna sit and do my planner because I'm feeling this way and because it's Monday it's gonna be day one of taking the CBD gummies I decided I'm just gonna take them for a week and see how they make me feel I don't know really how to go about this if I'm supposed to like take this only when I'm feeling like I don't know weirdly on the bottle it doesn't like tell you how many like you should take or anything so I'm just guessing you take one maybe I should look at the website maybe it says it on there it doesn't say like Oh take one dummy for every so hours or something you know this has been mentioned on CNN so if that's cool this brand it's just the calm buy wellness I mentioned it also on my Instagram but if they're not following me on there I go if you want to seen it I don't like gummies so this is gonna suck this I honestly just don't like gummies the reviews on here everyone is saying they taste really good Barney stop Barbie I did try one the other day just to like try it and I don't really like the flavor of them I think for people who like gummies this is a good option but for me I just I'm kind of dreading it cuz I really hate dummies you can can you tell by like just oh my god oh my mood right now is just but you can get free samples of the gummy packs so that's pretty cool Oh Barbie hey stop stop stop you're gonna get out stop she's messing up all my stuff that's on the floor I will include in the description box below though the link so that you guys can get a free sample if you want it has [Music] like why is this happening she's not even looking for anything she's just digging through it to see what she can find yeah we're watching you but she knows the word play do you want to play you want to play yeah you want to play I wish I remembered which one I tried the other day which cuz there's like different colors but I don't know if they're different flavors I don't like the smell and the texture they're like slimy I don't know if that's how they're supposed to be but mine are slimy your hosts should kind of see these they're pretty big dummies - so for someone who doesn't like that Me's this is awesome because they're the biggest got me sir ever seen in my life trying to focus a little bit so we've got a few gummies here this is like focusing okay oh hey Covey's I should try one of these pink ones I guess I'm gonna compared to the size of like a typical like perfume sample or like yeah like little sample like that's pretty large and they're slimy like not hella slimy but it's not like dry like I feel like I've got like oil the second oil and I can smell it on my fingers it's weird I'm sorry I don't like got me so I'm gonna eat this in like little bits probably super annoying but I can't stand it texture of gummies shy just eat the whole thing mmm oh okay this is nothing that I tried before cuz this one actually tastes good what the one I tried - oh they did not it was not my flavor mmm okay it's got it after taste the flavor is actually good okay I'm line the texture though hey gummies so we're gonna move past that just no I don't like that Me's in general so Barbie stop so we can move past that that has nothing to do it seemed like gummies gonna probably be fine with it the application it's got like a strong taste to it them like that hates you after a fruit flavor am I supposed to only take one day we'll take one for right now we'll take one to see how it makes me feel yeah cuz it doesn't tell you like who you should take one or two barb this sting my mouth I think those from candy I eat actually right so it's 3012 now I think it said somewhere these are supposed to be pretty fast acting all right I'm sorry I gotta get her out here oh that is my acetate paper for my planners excuse you do you want to get out would you like to get out and then we have a melody just laying over here just watching her be a jerk O'Malley oh yeah so it's now been a little bit over an hours since I took the CBD gummy I feel better but I'm also like doing my planner so that usually like calms me down like getting myself organized and like situated so I don't know if it was the gummy or if I'm just focusing on something else you know I'm also really really tired but that's because yesterday I didn't get much sleep like going into yesterday and then last night I think I got like seven hours but I needed like 75 I feel super chunky today like I feel chunkier today than I've felt in the past like two weeks so that's how I definitely know too that like I need to get working out again I need to start eating healthier again I'm gonna go grocery shopping tomorrow I feel so disgustingly chunky you know if you like gain weight and you like feel the weight gain it is like the most income being comfortable uncomfortable thing ever like I know this is not a weight that my body is comfortable at like I feel it just it's a weird thing to like explain unless you like get it if you know what I'm talking about you'll know like the feeling it's just not a good feeling at all I was actually sitting pretty good better I guess I brought it myself like last week it like the week before and I think that's the problem that's led me to today I thought I was fine with not working out and I could eat whatever I wanted again and that's not the case I need to be eating healthy and I need to be working out I wonder if you guys can tell a difference in my mood cuz I feel like maybe I can but like I said my mind is just a little bit getting clearer cuz I'm currently doing my planner right so hey guys it is now Tuesday I am just getting myself ready to go to Trader Joe's you guys know I hate grocery shopping I made a list it's literally so grande I'm going to Walmart and then I'm going to shoot in there Jose I'm eating a lot of stuff some stuff I am gonna put in the freezer I would only have one two three four I am on a budget so that's why - I'm really particular about staying - my list since we know I hate grocery shopping it makes me feel really weird and anxious just cuz I hate going I'm gonna try to take one of these CBD gummies today I think these make me really really tired though every time I've had one I've needed to like take a nap oh I kinda wanna just go with the pink one again cuz that one tasted really good keep going I really that bite Jason Jason definitely tasted the way weed smells but the pink ones show them I need to get off my booty we're gonna change over my purse I'm doing a hat on because you're a hide from the world today I don't want that I wanna have like crossbody bag so shouldn't carry this one I just up so high today's Wednesday I just like pumped up my lip so they'll crazy and I put lip lip balm it's almost 3 o'clock that's like 250 something to me my first time taking CBD for today cuz I'm feeling a little bit anxious again I feel like this usually happens when like I start thinking about everything that I need to do for the day but I'm not currently doing that I should be doing so they meant like my body just kind of like starts to freak out gonna take some gummies I say some I'm gonna try to take two this time and just see what it does for me I feel like they make me tired though and we can you like just need to take nap I already finished like editing my video so if I do pass out it'll kind of be okay even though not really because I have a lot to do but so I'm sure to take two of the like I guess strawberry ones like the pink ones these are my favorite ones if I can really get used to the like aftertaste up uh-oh I just peed gummies it's okay I can't chew it fast enough oh yeah the flavor was a lot better that time it was just the consistency the texture not like 200 but like I just feel like I need to eat something so let's go throw weight oh I was like Chevy taking clothes downstairs with me there's stuff in the dryer they need to take out and take back upstairs we are in my disgusting disgustingly unorganized laundry room dry stuff in the dryer well that's going gonna carry this upstairs I'm gonna make me some toast as a snack right now bah that's going I'm gonna take out as making it anyone waiting for that okay there's my toast doesn't look too exciting but it's so good I feel so much better right now maybe because I ate too though but like look at the chunks what I think I'll quit no it's just what to say I feel a lot better after taking two and eating days what Thursday yeah I am just doing my makeup for the day my allergies are like acting up so bad today which is why I like wheezing I'm so just do my makeup cuz I'm filming a few little videos today I've been using like this dry little B blender to do my like concealer and everything to like blend everything in lately what I do it on top of like the cushion foundation and the dry Beauty Blender is like the weight like it doesn't like soak up as much of your products really going on your face so you're not wasting a ton of products doesn't like dilute it down or any like the fullest coverage have these little like hairs like little I don't even know what they came from now how am I here somewhere but don't see it gonna bother me there it is and you use a brush or anything so it's really weird Jaclyn hill lipsticks attacking me and I don't have them but yeah if you are not using a dry Beauty Blender for at least you're like concealer and contour you got a step in makeup game up honestly because it's the new way of just saying I wanted you say because we are trying out the CBD gummies CBD oil last night I don't know what made me decide to take them before going to bed right I really did get like such a good sleep lately I've been having like really bad dreams I'd wake up and I would be like really sad and like almost like super depressed after the dreams cuz they were just like they'd be so vivid in like so real real life situations like things that actually I've dealt with in my life so I would just wake up feeling sad last night like I know I had dreams but like they weren't so crazy bad and I woke up feeling good and I actually woke up before my alarm which was really weird I really did get a good sweet definitely I'm gonna try to take them before bed again tonight I took two I wouldn't put it like 1:30 is the only reason I didn't go to sleep at like 11 or 12 was because I was stuck watching Netflix there's my finished makeup look I didn't really want to wear this shirt to do my videos but I might just wear for one I actually want to have a matcha green tea frappe why although I am finishing editing that video so I can drink it while I do it because I don't want to like be drinking it while I'm cooking kind of and I don't want it to like melts and like not stay blended go with you what I'm wearing just to put you guys up a little higher this is how often I use sugar yeah I think you're supposed to have something in there so that it doesn't do this what the heck has something like I just I guess use a spoon I didn't really want to use a ton of my teeny matcha but I guess that's what we're doing I'm just gonna have to get another bag of this stuff because it is so good at MCT oil into like everything because it gives you such good energy and this is like a treat obviously like a hella treat because I'm putting that at the sugar folding beverage taste test she's a little bland hey guys it's Friday afternoon now well I already had my hummus snacks look for breakfast time bro I wake up at like 10:00 right now I'm making another matcha smoothie or like fat because I want to see if I can make it taste a little bit better today I feel like I'm talking to though because my allergies are just actually not really bad and like my eyes are actually burning already put eyedrops in them [Music] [Music] it's better oh so tired now I just filmed thinner videos like I did a few more than I expected to do today so he's not so tired all of a sudden YouTube reminded me that I have bio-oil I don't know if this actually works but I'm trying to remember to use this which I have left it takes so long to go through a bottle of bio oil not gonna live from getting a little bit more chunky from like gaining weight I've gotten stretch marks and it's not pretty it's not cute I mean embrace your stretch marks or whatever but like I've never had them in some of these areas before I know that it only have them because of my weight game and it's annoying because I never should have day the way in the first place when I stopped eating healthy so I've had this out I don't know why I need to mention that I thought it was funny because like YouTube oh you know how like there's that like ad that comes down for buy oil I have cat hair all over like it's stuck to my foundation right now it is stuck in my makeup there's the ad for a bio oil and it made me remember it reminded me did I need to use my bio oil on my stretch marks my gosh it literally just started writing why soon I will out right now so even dark you probably can't hear it in the video but it's definitely an owl like really far away [Music] Darwin who well Ian so now's like love this out of the rain yes it sounds like don't have to sit this close to the microphone and to the camera he's gonna see my my hair is all crazy I redid my skincare for the night I hate when the doors open I don't know why cuz it just like kind of creeps me out it's like that so we're not gonna show that I don't know why oh I just it's creepy my face like so oily from all my skincare like chugged a green smoothie I like wasn't really hungry and I'm not just eating past ten but I like my diet nice that's a rule that I put on myself because I still like eating past 10:00 so last night that I'm gonna be going into really talking about taking my CBD gummies cuz I figured tomorrow's Sunday might as well just wrap it up tomorrow with my overall thoughts so I'm going to take my two gummies for the night cuz I do like taking two at night like I said it's 10:00 it's 10:13 actually and I think I said earlier I suggest taking these like thirty minutes or an hour before the time you want to go to bed it is Saturday so usually I am you would think I would like let myself stay up I have a ton of filming to do tomorrow so I wanted like wake up at like a good time we're gonna take these now so these are the colors that I got for now for tonight this one is shades really weird that's what I kept staring at it you can see it's almost got like a lip to it actually they're so fine look into how like you can see like all the bubbles in there like all the oils in there you know how like if you put oil in water it doesn't mix but you stir it up it's got a little bubbles oil click this one takes it really good I'm getting more used to the texture also well because I'm forcing myself to I'm still not a fan of gummies these pink ones red ones Oh Beth look like a disaster I know but whatever today is Saturday today was going so great I had the best sleep ever I took some more of the gummies right before going to sleep last night best sleep freaking ever and the morning was going great until I was singing my office room and I should leave the doors connected to my bedroom open so that the cats can just like run around because Barbie loves to just like run through here with all her energy right I'm sorry about my hair okay all of a sudden I heard a crash and it was like a multiple crash type crash and then within the multiple crash type crash there was a sound of glass breaking a bedroom is actually one of the rooms that has the most breakable items in it because usually before I got Barbie with O'Malley I kept this door closed like she was never allowed in my bedroom most important thing is I'm allergic to cats so I can't really have cats all over my bed where I sleep because I don't be sick all the time but also because this room is where I have the most breakable stuff like it's just everywhere so when I heard the glass so many things went through my head I thought that she knocked over my perfume and that because we know if your fume is expensive and also because that would've meant I had perfume staining stuff but luckily okay luckily that wasn't I come in my room and I'm like scouring everything I cried when I looked at it this stuff is right there and if you can see it looks all dumb now because there was like a tray type thing oh it is now on the floor I sat it there like that though but that's what she ended up breaking this piece broke off it actually looks like this thing was in two pieces and they just like glued it because if you look at it like there's just like that yellow around it is actual like glue it's actually this beautiful tray you've gotten forever go from t.j.maxx this is the brand of stuff that I really really love getting artistic accents I think it's need so much lipstick that's why I still have the tag attached to it handmade glass decorated by hand using genuine silver made in Turkey so it's like this Turkish glass that I'm gonna have to glue back together and then put it back and put everything back on top I also have this one this is by that same brand I can't really like turn it around I guess I actually could yeah so this is by the st. brand from TJ Maxx yeah and then here's all of my perfumes that I thought she broke I literally almost like my heart almost fell out of my chest when I thought it was my perfumes but luckily it wasn't so it is Sunday I'm currently filming the videos right now which is why I'm having like a full face of me come on also how can you use here once again this is not a sponsored video at all I don't think I said it at the beginning this is not sponsored I didn't get paid at all for this I did get sent the comics for free though just to try out and let you guys know my thoughts one of these two the final day of taking or least for filming it taking the CDD gummies I just want to give you guys my final thoughts after taking them for a full week again I'm going to say I actually really really hate gummies so we can just throw that off it's raining right now so if you can kind of hear the little it's the rain so we can just kind of throw that in there right now so obviously I'm not gonna have anything nice to say about the texture anything because I just don't like gummies in general but if you do like gummies I'm sure you'll really like these the flavor of them there was the one flavor that I didn't like by the end of the week all of them were pretty good to me I think I got like used to the flavor also when I first started taking them there was like the aftertaste was a lot stronger and then after taking them for a week that kind of went away everything kind of like what I just said I liked ended up liking all flavors at the end of the week I think my favorite one is the right one which I want to say is strawberry but I'm not sure cuz they don't have at least not here I don't see any like flavor names on here though it does say it's supposed to improve sleep which I definitely definitely definitely think it does if you are someone who is a little bit hard for you to fall asleep at night or you just want like a deeper better sleep so that you feel rested the next day this has been great for that about the rain I would sit down and do this as soon as it's raining and you guys are sitting right on the windowsill okay it's like a monsoon all of a sudden I can't even see out my window Wow okay definitely try these out I think if you are looking for something to improve the quality of your sleep or to just help you fall asleep easier I definitely like taking these like 30 minutes to an hour or two hours before I go to bed I think I would take these around like ten and then by the time I was ready to go to sleep like I could still decide when I wanted to go to sleep but it was like when I decided I want to sleep I was out I wasn't laying in bed trying to like fall asleep I was done I hate when like I just can't fall asleep it also says on here it's good for post-workout recovery working out I couldn't tell you if it's good for that support for everyday stress I do think it's definitely helped me out I did take these before I went to the store the other day and just being at stores especially certain stores like I think I have to go grocery shopping or something earlier in the week those are some of my like most stressful times like my anxiety just gets really really bad these definitely helped it was taking one at first and then I think 2 is probably at least for me to think to work better I don't know I do think they're pretty fast acting so I mean I guess that's true it says that I'm here too but I wish that was something that it said on the bottle itself like most supplements or medications I just wish it said like Oh take one gummy for this take two gummies for this if you want to feel this take more you know what I mean like there isn't really like a serving like the best serving amount that was kind of something that I needed to like play around with a little bit to see like what was best for me but I think two gummies is really where it was at for me it says even on here there's no THC any so you're not getting high okay if that's what you try to do these aren't gonna do that for you I never felt like weird or groggy on them obviously because there's no it's just the oil the next day even after my sleeps I did feel very well-rested I was able to get going with my day like right away overall though I do think these are pretty good only for the sleep thing that was just my favorite thing to like use them for was to help me get to sleep and like the last few days that's kind of what I was really using these for but like I did say at least did really help me if I took them like 30 minutes or an hour before I knew I was gonna be going somewhere that does usually kind of spike my anxiety levels I was pretty good when I was there so this was the only change that I had made I do know that you can try out some of the gummies I think for free I think you just have to pay shipping or whatever their website and I will include everything in the description box below so you guys can check it out definitely still @hc not with THC with CBD it's looking at the tea to see with CBD anything you should definitely do your research I recommend you know definitely checking out their website and everything but I do think these really helped me out for what it says they're supposed to help you out with yeah I put everything in the description box below so you guys can check them out let me know in the comments below if you guys have tried anything CBD related and let me know if how that worked for you I'd love to hear from you guys because CBD was actually something that I've been talking to all my friends about before because I guess it's just it's it's the new upcoming thing and a ton of people are saying it really helps them so I've just been looking into it everything will be in the description box below so you guys can check out their website if you guys are like Nene don't really like gummies they do have actual oil as well so that you can do like little droppers so definitely check them out though if you guys have been interested in CBD oil at all you know a lot of people use CBD obviously for like stress or helping with your sleep and for pain as well so that's kind of what I've been looking into the CBD for for all those reasons so this video a thumbs up if you guys

products right so this is another company that sent me a nice batch of goodies for me to kind of evaluate and to see if we want to sell them here at the pharmacy etc etc so OH like I've done with the with a previous video I'll talk briefly about CBD what is CBD CBD is the other side of THC right so the hemp plant the hemp plant which is the cousin of marijuana you know when you break that plant down you get THC and CBD THC gives you the high the weed and the smoking and all that great jazz right but in CBD talk we want to be able to find an isolate CBD because it has all the medical benefits to it right so in children there is relief from epilepsy right I've been looking at a lot into that as well for adults though there have been a lot of strong studies that suggest that it improves people who have suffered from insomnia anxiety and pain neuropathic regular pain so and in the news and in the media you've seen this stuff yeah this stuff is like a cure all right everyone get this this cures everything in the world well that's the thing that's why I'm so fascinated by this stuff so I've been trying out all the CBD products I can get my hands on just because I don't have a view on CBD myself and my ICD believer know my CC VD D truther or or whatever I'm not I'm like literally I'm neutral I have no idea what to think so I've been using this stuff myself to kind of come to my own conclusion and so what do you have to kind of look for is do you suffer from anything you have to kind of do controlled experiments with this stuff right to kind of really to really see whether you're getting a host or whether it's something legit right so so a couple of the products that these companies sent me they all are kind of used for different things I got the CBD rapid cooling cream 250 milligrams they even gave me packets of the 750 milligrams right so this is topical you put on your joints right I got another one here the CBD melatonin right so it's melatonin essentially with CBD and it's melatonin ten milligrams if you're wondering with 25 milligrams of CBD in it right and then I also have a tincture of CBD in it and let's see here one dropper full is thirty three milligrams of pure CBD isolate in oil in MCT oil right so I didn't really I'll start with this one I didn't really use this I don't have sleep issues I don't like taking stuff for stuff I don't really have but I gave this to my cousin he's he's got sleeping issues he takes melatonin and and some other stuff from time to time for sleep like Tamil PM and things like that so I give this to him as a perfect kind of control I was like you know what Bill Graham strength of Milton you takes it takes ten which was perfect so I was like you know what I want you to stop out for the next couple of weeks sub this in and take melatonin out right he tried it and kind of what the conclusion came out was you couldn't see it you couldn't feel a difference it did its job right and so I bet you this stuff is a lot more expensive than melatonin that you could get at like a CVS or Walgreens or something so melatonin being super cheap and then this stuff being expensive I I always go with the cost-effective things so he couldn't feel any effects that doesn't mean you can you know try it out for yourself I'm not telling you to use these products or not use these products I'm just saying here's a little bit of information I'm gonna give you and then you make your own decision beyond that you want to go try these products out for you really suffer from sleep in and you want to know how much like CBD is in your products and mint Tara does a good job of making sure you know because there are a lot of other CBD products I've tried out they don't tell you whom to CBDs in their products which is like kind of crazy right so this one had 25 milligrams of CBD per per tablet and 10 milligrams of melatonin each tablet so that's that one this one I'm still kind of in the middle of as you can tell it's still got they gave me 2 tinctures I'm kind of through one it's a CBD oil but it's also in seeped in MCT oil so I'm on the keto diet so for MCT oil I was like that I can definitely use it so I've been using one dropper full a day I've not really seen in a difference in my baseline no I'm still in ketosis most of the time it doesn't help me accelerate getting into ketosis or anything not any more than then putting like buttering a coffee or putting some coconut oil in and coffee or some sort of an accelerant when I say accelerant a fat source if you utilize a fat source or if you take like I don't really like using those Kido products to like exogenous ketones there you go that's what I was looking for I'm not a big fan of using exogenous ketones if you don't have to that's what this is this is an exogenous ketone plus CBD in it so for that purpose is I haven't really really kind of seen a benefit from it you know that's that I have used quite a bit of the the CBD cooling cream though so here's why I take it so I I run a lot I'm a marathon runner so my knees after big long runs get get a key that gets sore they throb and so I usually take like one Aleve after my run and I'm usually fantastic right but with these products I was like is there a way that I could not use those orbble products and just stick to something topical right I always felt like been getting stuff wasn't really quite enough so in this thing you have let me see what I can get and they don't quantify it for you they don't tell you but yeah it's a bunch of junk so you got all kinds of different oils and things like that but it's a really it's a thin cream is what this is so I started using this Alma on my knees every night after one of my runs while I liked the cooling effect of it I didn't like how the cream itself was a little on the thin side so it absorbed up real quick and I felt like probably about thirty minutes afterwards I feel like you can't be effect started wearing off and so there are other CV products that I've reviewed where they're like pointman so I prefer I definitely definitely prefer an ointment base if I'm using it topically just and but if you're using it on their arms and stuff you're not gonna want an ointment cuz it's gonna be thick it's greasy it's gonna stay on you I like that for my knees because at the end of the night that's up sticks and here's a reason why the now we're coming back to the pharmacy world an ointment is really thick so whatever you're putting in the ointment slowly absorbs into your skin right and so you get a longer effect with it creams dough absorb really quickly so whatever you got in here whatever your active ingredients are they absorb more quickly into the skin and sometimes that that's what you want like if you have face acne you don't wanna stick a greasy pointment on you but you want a very quick vanishing cream right but for things like arthritis for for joint pain things like that you want to utilize a thick wingman cuz it stays and so I kind of like that and then that's kind of where I felt like they could have done a little bit better on when it came to this product is making a thicker of ointment instead of a cream but you may very well think I don't really care I like the cream I like that it's gone like that so give it a shot for yourself but at the end of the day I felt like there were other topical products that I've used that were more effective than this because again like I just I'm not a believer and all the I mean they have a I'll stick it to you this way but there are there's a Jack ton of ingredients that are in here and I don't like that kind of thing I don't care if I'm taking orally or if it's topical I like to stick to as few ingredients as possible and this has a giant list of all kinds of oils and things like that nothing that from a pharmaceutical standpoint would really work actually give me just a second I just kind of pop this through all the way yeah so so some of the things I was looking for was like menthol and camper or methyl salicylate those products are already in your conventional products like bengay icy hot ask for cream and things like that so I've seen a lot of different other CBD lines that we've I've started reviewing them this should be on the page where they makes those products with CBD so when you take some of the pharmaceuticals a mix of CBD I kind of tend to think that that's probably gonna be a better formula for success but it'll be hard to differentiate whether you're getting the benefit from the pharmaceutical or from the like CBD portion of it right so again like I said I wasn't the biggest fan of this I wanted to I like the met Tara really has like a giant product line of stuff L yeah and then as far as the oil goes oh god I wish these guys are flavored a little bit this stuff tastes literally like oil you're just swallowing oil I mean I don't want sugar and obviously if I'm using it for Kido purposes but monk fruit stevia man put something in and give me a flavor raspberry strawberry something it this is nasty man I I drink this before my coffee because it's disgusting so maybe just word of advice to meditate or kind of you know version two of your product line maybe add that in there for the next line of 10 cuz you guys do but guys that's it if you have questions concerns leave them down below like I said we've got a lot of CBD products that have come through in the pharmacy I'm gonna slowly I'm using them give me a couple of weeks I'm gonna start reviewing all of these products solely and hopefully we're gonna figure out this whole CBD thing okay well whether this stuff is effective it's not is it a hoax is it just here to steal your money or is it really the cure-all that they think it is I mean we're gonna find out guys all right I'll stay tuned see you next time bye [Music]", "stH5fLYRN2o": "[Music] what are the medical advantages of CBD gummies CBD chewy candies huge numbers

imbued with natural CBD as the outcome you get an astounding tasting and healthy CBD gummy there are no hurtful synthetic compounds or Energizer's either [Music]", "dwhdujJvYFY": "[Music] hi everyone thank you for joining me today this educational video is about hemp oil edibles you heard me right edibles you don't have to take a tincture and hold a liquid under your tongue and may not taste very good and so forth just like vitamins come in gummy form you too can have a cbd product as an edible as a gummy as a chocolate as a honey stick hard candy the list goes on and on and on and i'm going to show you a few that we carry at our store just for show and tell so you can see what it looks like for example peach rings this one's very popular uh this is a six no i'm sorry this is a 1200 milligram jar by the way when you see 1200 milligrams you're not getting 1200 milligrams in one gummy this is 1200 in the entire container in the entire jar so 1200 milligrams you're getting 60 pieces if you're taking one piece a day it'll last you two months this one happens to be 20 milligrams per chewable hence 60 times 20 equals 1200 milligrams total this is very confusing to a lot of people because they think that they're getting the 1200 every time they eat one i hear it all the time no you're not you're getting 20 milligrams per chewable that's important to know because some people need maybe 10 20. we have some by mile high for example those are 50 milligrams per edible and sometimes you just need something stronger it just really depends on what you're trying to address so just remember whenever you see that big number it stands for the number the amount number of milligrams per container that one happened to have been a just your typical regular gummy but there's also chewables that are for example these fruit snacks this one is vegan has no dyes as you can see the color is more natural looking it's they're using fruit to color it so it doesn't have yellow number five and blue number three and what have you that's important to some people and then uh these come in full spectrum or broad spectrum or isolates and sometimes we have also a pm formula some of them have a little bit of melatonin to help you with sleep but there's different ways to take it i like tiger woods who likes his chin gum when he's out there playing golf and is stressed out and needs something to calm his nerves you can have a chewing gum you can have mints you can have chocolate fruit bites pistachio bites we have almond butter and honey in a jar that you can just take it out and eat it and it's delicious and you're dosing yourself with cbd just know how to shop for it though because about eighty percent of all edibles out there are made with isolated products so what that means is the cbd is it's just that it's just pure cbd when it's an isolate it's used in edibles because it doesn't have the waxes and the chlorophyll and it doesn't have that hempy flavor it's good but it's not great and when you're out there shopping make sure you ask is this an isolate is this a broad spectrum or is this a full spectrum now if you get drug tested at work and you're afraid that you may fail a drug test by all means ask for a broad spectrum or an isolate because those have zero thc and it will put your mind at ease and you don't have to worry about failing a drug test but you know there are some people who just can't have the tincture don't want to have the tincture and for those people i say well have a gummy it's actually very easy to port if you're getting on an airplane if you're at work and uh you want to keep some gummies or something in your desk great no problem easy to carry around i've had a lot of women who've carried their hemp oil bottle in their purses i've done it myself where you don't screw on the top totally and a little bit of that oil leaks and it gets in your purse it's messy and it happens it happens so that's not fun but you know what you can have a gummy a chewable chewing gum what have you and you can dose yourself easily that way and you can leave your hemp oil bottle at home and just carry some gummies at work and or when you're traveling just take the gummies i hope this video was helpful to you and making a decision as to whether you want or need an edible it's certainly very easy to dose to children and sometimes to older people who already take a lot of medication which by the way if you're taking hemp oil you can probably get off of most if not all of your prescription medication by taking hemp oil i can you can watch that in my next video where i talk about that and how it's benefited so many people and why they're able to get off their medication it's not a big mystery but there is a reason why you're able to do that i hope you enjoyed this video if you have any suggestions or comments for me uh for my next video please feel free to do so let me know with social media i'm happy to do the research and again thank you for watching i hope you have a beautiful and blessed day", "UAKicaKYaNk": "cbd is wildly popular right now and it comes in many forms if you're just looking for a fun way to get your daily dose of calm edibles are the way to go in particular cbd gummies are an easy practical way to consume cbd and they can be delicious too in this video we're going to do a cbd gummies review of everything there is to know how are cbd gummies beneficial for one they're discreet cbd gummies look like any other gumdrops which means you can carry them to the workplace for inconspicuous dosing only you need to know when you take cbd second they're consistent for example each hemp pure cbd gumdrop contains 25 milligrams of broad spectrum cbd in each drop unlike cbd drops or vape oil it's measured for you already and you know you're getting 25 milligrams each time if made right cbd gummies can be delicious making it easier to take consistently and finally cbd gummies have long lasting effects since they enter the body through the digestive system gummies may not start to work very quickly however once the effects begin they last longer than drops or vape oil how to find a good cbd gumdrop there are a couple of things to look out for when searching for cbd gummies one make sure the brand conducts lab tests on their products you don't want any toxins or microbes in your edible and you want to make sure the label accurately depicts the amount of cbd in each piece second make sure that the brand sources their cbd from organically grown hemp hemp grown using pesticides or fertilizers could mean pesticides or fertilizers in your cbd gumdrop and you definitely don't want that how to take cbd gummies how you take cbd gummies depends on a few different factors how much cbd is in each gumdrop are you looking for therapeutic effects or just snacking if your cbd gumdrop is potent as hemp pure gumdrops are you won't need more than two a day we recommend starting with one gummy a day for a week and then increasing the dose if you feel like it sometimes you don't want to feel like you're taking a supplement which is when gumdrops are perfect sometimes you need something that tastes great and relaxes you too and gumdrops are perfect for that too if you're just starting out with cbd gumdrops are a great way to begin try one and let us know what you think if you found

increase your bottom line and help your clientele with children's gummies they're made by another company they're soaked up there they're a half made product you're not getting the proper milligrams I keep stressing milligrams strength is important until it gives you the milligrams that come out of the plant that's why it's all it's a whole plant extract you're getting every milligram that you pay for unlike these super high dose gummies that are claiming 50 a hundred milligrams and tinters that are the 5,000 milligrams it's all made-up they're not real milligrams that's an isolated with an oil it's a it's a mixed up it's not what the whole plant gives you have Zillah gives you a whole plant extraction", "8acW4bM3nBk": "[Applause] [ __ ] so today review quick supreme hemp gummies 5,000 milligrams so this is I guess I just call it an Amazon special there's no name of the company anywhere the company may be supreme hemp gummies 5,000 milligrams so in these it comes with 60 bears serving sizes one quick breakdown is it's 10 calories 2 grams of sugar now if you look in here they're extremely sugary this is a sour gummy and there's a lot of sugar in it so people that are looking for a more natural gummy bear you know the ones that I'd like just me out of the wax or whatever gelatin this probably wouldn't be your go-to because it does have food dye in it's got blue number one yellow number five but aside from all that it's water gelatin corn syrup nothing [ __ ] crazy so I'm a guy I've got a lot of back pain I've got a lot of issues Colio cysts the Jenner disc disease so I take a lot of medication on top of it but obviously if you're doing this on top of medication I'm not you know I shouldn't really give medical advice but this is this isn't gonna counteract anything like non-steroidal like an anti-inflammatory or I'm also relaxed or it's it's it's not gonna be dangerous if you're taking via this in conjunction to that so again this is 5,000 milligrams ingestible that sounds like a lot but you know I was taking ten at a time towards the end because I bought I bought two and I can't say I've really seen any benefits for pain I do say it maybe made me a little bit less mentally distressed like I feel like I went to bed and slept a little bit better don't recall waking up as much as I usually do because I'm always moving around cuz my back pain so I'd say taste-wise 210 I was eating these like [ __ ] candy which probably isn't a good idea you know if you get too and I think the price is $20 all this I did was on Amazon I searched up CBD gummies and this was one of the first ones that come up now this is the label so what I recommend it long term I'd have to say no I wouldn't it didn't have a lot of benefits for me would I recommend it taste wise to see if it may be something that CBD would be beneficial for you like if you never really try CBD yeah I guess this would be like a good entry-level thing let's say if maybe like you can tell us into the realm of trying CBD I would have to say that a hemp and CBD for me at least it's more beneficial you know if it's topographical is that's a very [ __ ] word I don't know but you know it's like a cream or lotion if I wrote it on the panes you know like as a replacement for bengay or icy hot I'd say hemp conceive it is more beneficial that way so I'll give that like a zero to ten ten being the greatest taste wise this [ __ ] amazing like I'd rather eat these then any incoming bears like Haribo or anything these things were [ __ ] bomb and that and that extent but for medicinal purposes not so much alright guys thanks again have a go", "iA07WpYWQpM": "hey guys welcome to another video event and today I got you know another review coming up right now hacks leak I just got

everyone this is your boy sos death valley back at you guys with another great video on gummies making gummies and this is what i use there's no secret to it at all whatsoever what i use uh this round right here i'm mixing up a batch it's gonna be one and one uh thc right here which i got my shake and my trim and everything like that i've been saving up pretty daggone good and the cbd that i had for the wife which was uh lowest uh i need a lotus cbd which was pretty damn good uh she likes the amnesia cbd a lot more better which is man so it's a lot more better i'm not gonna lie i got a lot more nose to it if you ask me but uh that's what your boy is using today and here he already carved my smoke in the oven for 25 minutes at 325 but anyway this is what i'm going to be using the starburst blue raspberry you can use any kind that you want i use the knox gelatin that's basically what i use nothing special to get it any harder or anything like that and of course i use the you know coconut non-refined that's what i use different ones you can see you can use but i've been using is the nature's way extra virgin coconut oil pure unrefined is what you want to use is unrefined so that's what i use but man everything's been going real good we've been making these things been turning out real awesome and uh last batch i did i used uh mixed up blue raspberry and cherry together which was pretty dad going good guy like it i end up mixing adding a little uh a little bit of dabs to it and forbidden fruit just the other one i normally use is the blue blue berry blue or i use you know the strawberry cherry but that's what i've been using i was stacked up on those things now i need to get more because like i say i've been making these things like it ain't nothing man they've been selling them getting rid of them they are damn good damn good pretty strong like i said last time i mixed i had about a uh a half a gram out of a grandma forbidden fruit uh dabs and oh my

change being a positive feedback for us because without you we wouldn't be who we are so then you are also my god before we get started can you give people a little bit more of your background because I know a lot people owe me more yeah let me do that I still gotta get used to looking straight at the camera and all this being on film stuff so it's a little all right I'll stare into the camera so my name is Mike my background is I've worked for about 10 years in the health and supplement industry I've also was a sales trainer for a national automotive manufacturer I worked as a federal agent was on the US Attorney's Healthcare task force out here where I'm located you know now I'm into the helping people the natural healing I've seen a lot of vets a lot of first responders a lot of people seniors just every condition you can imagine needing help and just tired of using traditional pharmaceuticals and a couple years back I got into more the cannabinoid part of the industry researching that learning about that that's kind of where we stand right now I'll go into more details later about some more specifics but that's just a general overview so what do you take what do you take CBD for me I take it for neuropathy carpal tunnel back issues not so much like anxiety and stuff like that more physical physical ailments things that have inflammation so and just overall general health like to boost my inda cannabinoid system like how we kind of take stuff for our immune system to keep that strong we need to keep our tender cannabinoid system strong and so I take it daily for that usually between fifty and a hundred milligrams for me just because I have a lot of inflammation and like physical permanent injuries so I take a little bit more than the average person but you know it works in all dosages so yes and for me my first time taking in CBD was for pain in my wrist I have tore ligaments and now I have arthritis on my right hand from military injuries I have a cyst on my left hand I have no nerve damage of my fingers so I was in pain here and I have two arguments in my left hand and when I first started taking it he helped so much with the pain but the biggest benefits that I wasn't expected is he helped me with my anxiety and my depression and a lot of it had to do with not just the fact that I never say fixes my anxiety depression but it allowed me to really go after my dreams which is just to be a educator and help people and through the process of adding on things like eating better and meditation I was able to live a better life which I'm currently doing now so those of you who are watching we always want to tell you that don't think of CBS a cure but as a tool to use to help you become better because take a CD alone is just like taking a pill and not taking care your body isn't gonna help you rawrr become healthier so you want a couple it will even right you know after your mental state is watch watching TV and the people who you are around so this is just a little bit about us and learn more by going to CBD down how WWDC be how for all things education base so today I'm excited to be talking about a few products I know I have a vape from Cindy line which is a distillate it's 500 milligrams of CBD and I also have a symptom bomb from Green health um naturals and so they started experimenting with the full spectrum line and I'm grateful that I was able to try it out on the website they have a thousand milligrams so I get started on this and there might be just go back and forth is that cool with you okay absolutely alright so let's start with the bomb so I'm gonna paint a lot my joint so like I said I have austerity which is just chronic pain I have no cartilage in my wrist so it's just bone on bone grinding and that's what us your itis is and then on my left hand I have like I said I have a cyst and I have torn ligaments and then I have nerve damage in my fingers which I also had it on my right hand but I had three charges on here and so I don't really feel the nerve damage as bad I know that there's damage there but they cut the nerve so I use a lot of bombs and when it comes to review products one of the things I tell people is I don't want any samples because for me this light here will work wonderful I feel like a day or two from traveling but if I want to review a product and really test it properly I want something that could last for me a good couple weeks the same thing goes with dentures so this is why I always make sure that this stuff is empty you see it's gonna be using for over a month now in came handy when I traveled to New York and Maryland last last month so the thing I like about it compared to the current part which actually this is full-spectrum and it has a ton of benefits in here so I'm gonna give the ingredient real quick is beeswax coconut oil castor oil turmeric lavender wintergreen count for a peppermint yin-yang I'm up I'm center-right helichrysum blue tan G blue camomile better care fill in and just a bunch of other benefits in here so on the website the 1000 milligram for the foot comes in two lungs is $75 or $74.99 uses winterized full-spectrum CBD oil and it's just a bunch of turbines out here they have a really good CoA which has I'll give you a so CVG I see one point four four percent CBD is ninety four point seven six percentage for overall and the container CBN has point four ten there is one point nine percent of distribution of THC which is point zero seven I'm still under point three percent CBC is point zero six which is one point six seven percent distribution and so it's uh it's wonderful to see that this is actually a full-spectrum product now as far as mean when it comes to trying products that I like to rub it in aggressively especially when I'm in pain and for those of you who are in the cold weather climate knows that it's your pain affects more especially when you rain so it lasts normally for me anyway between two to four hours and it depends what I'm doing if I say Bevans stop doing anything then I could get it for about four five hours if I'm not doing anything at all but if I'm actually doing work anonymously anyway from about two hours an average and I might have to keep I planned it one thing I could do is add it on my ankles when I'm doing yoga in the morning and then before and after lists to help calm the inflammation and yeah this is where I'm now I don't have any problems with it you know it's a really good price per thousand milligrams compared to some of the others I see and I love the fact that I'm not a company I've been talking them for three years so I've been part of the process of helping them grow whenever they have a question Bevan um what do you recommend I always keep my feedback and this goes to anybody so any companies that ask me for my feedback I'm waddling open not just the Brenna said we trust but if you are new brand said hey Bevin them he please helped me do you have any idea and resources to help us I will gladly do it within reason but so I just just want to make sure that food transparency is here and this is one of the brands that I know I like to follow the journey because one of the things comes to killing with the owner he loves to go out in the community and mingle with veterans he's always just dropping by and if you see a veteran he will give him a bomb or in the sample of his CBD of tincture so Brian is really good and the brand is called green thumb Naturals and WWE green thumb Naturals calm and go onto the website to check it out any thoughts on this Oh Mike no I like your the formulation of it it didn't seem like camphor was the first ingredient or menthol or something that's gonna you know get on your fingers and and rubbing your eyes and later on a bunch of essential oils and herbs and stuff and it's a consistency more like a it's like a ball kind of like a thicker what's that it's more the greasy side so like when I rub it in my hand it's CBBC here he sees a little more greasy uh-huh which is fine yeah just fine it's compared to some of the others is fine I've tried some that had tumeric in them and they stain my clothes they stain my pillow on oh no we call it our couch so this one doesn't did it so I really like it even though it's a Monica Lee she said he works wonderful I like it I haven't any issues with it one thing I was gonna say too with the essential oils and creams essential oils tend to oxidize a lot that real essential oils oxidize when exposed to air and opening containers back and forth so a lot of times in your cream products or your bombs or your your stuff like that if they start to turn color brown to pink over time it's because of the oxidation of the essential oils it doesn't mean the products necessarily going bad so that sounds like a good product it seems a lot more natural not so synthetic Elia Rollag you might forget or Walmart or something that's nice oh I agree I agree so which one you which product you have to start with well I have three of the same category so today I'm gonna focus on like gummies or soft true type stuff so okay I'll just show you all three and then I'll talk about one at a time but what I'm gonna compare is one is I got to work on this lighting situation but it's called curly fro leave yep pro leave CBD and fuse gummies then we have a green green Rhodes CBD froggies kind of shaped like a frog and we have a wash Bach alchemy squid full spectrum have extract like a natural gummy type thing so I think first well what did I show you guys first the pro leave I'll start with this first um I'm sorry like so bad anyway I'm just gonna take a sample of each one to give you guys a feel for like taste this is just all my opinion everybody has different feelings on case but with the pro leave the main ingredients are organic glucose syrup and they do put parentheses or weak so people dunno if you have a celiac disorders almonds listed organic cane sugar pectin citric acid ascorbic acid natural flavours natural colours organic concentrate Apple organic carrot pumpkin and blackcurrant and industrial hemp so I mean there's a little bit of cane sugar and stuff but overall it's it seems to be a little bit healthier choice than a lot of them on the market I think this one is a 50 milligram so I just randomly picked they're kind of shaped just like a orange slice or like a loner stop so I'm just gonna sample course opinion asking the month of sugar per serving on this one sugars 2 grams nice not too high really you know this one you can definitely taste like the cane sugar put in a way if you're somebody who craves sugar this might not be a bad bad option no it has a good taste to it that has oh I was gonna mention it has the QR code when you scan it I believe on this one I test for heavy metals microbials mild toxins the whole gamut of stuff and it did test out you know I know exactly but it's very close to 50 so it was within compliance reasons for that it's a good case I would say it's a good compromise in between but he wants something sugary but a little bit more on the healthier side this would be this would be a good product to UM try I can't tell you necessarily on the effect because I haven't tried it for 30 days so I don't want to make you know tell you all this works great and blah blah blah but based on the lab tests and if your body responds you know for all the CBD I think it's gonna work good for you so it's just another alternative it's in between the market of high fructose corn syrup candies and completely vegan it's one it's on the healthier side but it's you know it's right in the middle I would say so and I think the price is roughly I could look it up but there's 50 milligrams per gummy I think it's around $60 for a 30-day supply or somewhere around there you can get more information I think it pro leave p ro le ve pro leave calm if you want to look at this stuff on that so so one quick aid came in is it full spectrum I said a broad spectrum this one is right here it will tell me I just want to make sure they completely right no THC it says on here and let's look at the ingredients one more time industrial hemp so we'd have to pull the lab tests right now oh they don't cannabidiol doesn't say this or that I'm not sure I was going more for the taste and like the ingredients today on these because there's three of them but that's one you could look up it does have the warning and does not contain more than 0.3% Delta 9 THC on it so that would give me the feeling that there might be a minor amount then on this side it says no THC so that may be one thing you want address on your labeling if you're if if you're working for that company if one thing says contains less does not contain more than 0.3% delta-9 and then your other picture says I gotta get a sled if there's no THC so yes probably be more labeled what it contains MIT's broad-spectrum full-spectrum or just cannabidiol by itself it doesn't say so I'm just gonna look at it from a standpoint if you pick that up in the store you wouldn't have the lab test right in front of you you may be a little confused so maybe fix the labeling a little bit on that that would help out the consumer so yeah it just says haven't arrived CVD or doesn't say anything I'm assuming it's gonna be severe isolate on there this is one of the things promised me I work with brands you're not specific enough when it comes to us on the product for me it's caused us a lot of misinformation and you wrote to trust the community we need not be more open to the ingredients right and I just kind of want to focus like we're just today and some of the reviews we've done before and then the future will do you know more in-depth I kind of wanted to look at these two days like I pulled it off the shelf and here's ingredients and you know this is what the consumer would see off the top of their head so knowing yeah it was a big score or a deeper item I must have right now no we are we have a website a platform for reviews where we region the actual brand itself and there's gonna be on but we still testing it now has a rating system if you want to go right now look at it simply that how slash reviews we were launching that over the next couple weeks so that will we have where you can leave your comments on the company and the plan is to have so for example right now we have Dutch natural and tonic so Dutch natural is a company and then on the day we will be add an individual products as time goes on but like I said again this is something that's to take time because our team is very small a lot of these things we do is just opening it freely and so we have to manage our time appropriately when it comes to pushing out the content and so as we slowly develop the team and able to create the systems in place we'll be able to that populate is as fast as possible now if some of you who are interested in reviewing or have me reviewing products and you'd like to contribute to to us towards the reviews will be gladly open to that and build some SAP type of system where you can be part of this and help us educate the community properly so just you know this is this lab is the first of many for us we still try to make sure that all the kinks out here and so we thank you so much for the support that you've given us and just being asking the questions and so thank you so much okay so I think as we're just getting started on this and just getting the new platforms and trying out the technologies and stuff if you guys have suggestions on how you want the products rated for the future like a 1 through 10 scale or certain criteria or stuff like that we'd love to hear that because we're here to help you sure we can make our own and this and that but what do you guys want to see how do you want it rated if you want to comment on the Instagram accounts that CBD dot how or at great CBD reviews or send a message over we'll take all that into consideration because we're here for you you know as the consumer so whatever you would like to see if there's enough people want it rate it that way then you know we'll take that into consideration all right so let's do stick to them the other I'm gonna go so let's try to perform what do you think of it from you got me I don't know but I have two flavors so here's what they here's one CBD froggy 50 milligrams green roads this one is I'm guessing like a lemon it doesn't really say oh no it just it's yellow this one is purple so I'm assuming that's great it doesn't say just as omnigul these are again self-serve you know one time use pack so like again I can't give you a 30-day evaluation how the product works when you only have single serving packs you I'm not gonna tell you as effective or not because I can't make that decision so um the the gummy so if you guys comment Bevan if you can tell me which one they want me to eat or if you want you to eat one or the other I don't care but let me give you the ingredient which one the great one to try to grip on to me think about it okay let me read you the ingredients first before I try it I don't know this just on the packaging - they have a QR code I scanned that one this morning it had all the all the proper testing done on and it met within criterion for the 50 milligrams like the ingredients are this one's a little sweeter corn syrup sugar gelatin citric acid natural and artificial flavors FD&C red number forty yellow number six yellow number five blue number one then 50 milligrams of phyto cannabinoid rich oil parenthesis PCR it may cause drowsiness and not recommended if pregnant or breastfeeding so it's also made in the USA by green ropes so let me have break this bad boy open it says MD THC so that would mean like not detectable or none detected THC um a lot of people won't even know what that nd means so again on your labeling these companies need to be a little more specific about exactly what they're using I get what they're trying to do not mention certain things but if you call your product CBD froggy you might just want to list the kind of CBD New Jersey so here we go he tried that Colet you know that is isolate product and I could tell you compared to some of the others that I would never personally wouldn't pick this one over others out the first one is so much better for us when it comes to the quality of it and the sugar here is 9 grams of sugar okay it is it is a lot bigger than the other it's like 2 to 3 times as big as the other piece so it's a bigger piece that's probably why but let me put this frog in my mouth kind of a big frog in my throat soon so mom magazine that so he has zero cholesterol is no sodium here 11 grams of carbs 1 gram of protein it's actually picked to calorie fat in the calories so one of the problems I have with the frog is is that he has artificial ingredients it's FD&C red 40 yellow 6 yellow 5 blue one and like when it comes to gummies love you know having something is more organic at least as close to possible so much better I like your natural stuff is just just stuff added that doesn't really help your body you know is it a still a broad spectrum because the Webster says when you look at the lab reports that blonde puts on a show CBI slip I'm just CBL is not a Miami noise in there so what is isolate more spectrum all I can say good baseball the lab reports is only showing CB Iceland oh yeah that makes sense where it says uh hold on non detected THC so there we go um taste-wise it's not as sweet as the pro league one I thought to be a little bit sweeter with those ingredients like corn syrup and stuff but it's um actually is more of a ahem flavor to it kind of weird I agree with you on the ingredients i i'm the human guinea pig here today so i don't like putting all these um colorings into me I don't know why we I guess when you use the color spectrum wheel that made purple yellow five yellow six red forty blue one mix them together and you got a art project here looks like a frog but it uh I don't know ingredients you're right I I personally probably wouldn't choose this I would say at this point the prob'ly taste a little bit sweeter and is a healthier alternative but you know if you're on the go and you're you love frogs or if you have a friend who loves frogs or even I don't know I don't know what the point of the Frog is honestly maybe it was their favorite pet as a kid I but anyway that's the CBD froggy I think they make other CBD creatures and things they make a ton of products but uh it's full of too many synthetics for my liking so I would say at this point pro leave is in the lead as far as taste and ingredients so what do you what are your thoughts on that question Kim you know so we thought so no screaming so I've actually tried these and they're pretty good which flavor do you have so this one here is a Crisp Apple oh I have crisp apples so why don't we are you gonna eat yours today I'm gonna get it right okay let me grab one more flavor over here and you can tell me about that one I'll grab them so I've tried these in different flavors and compared to some of the other one allows you like these they have organic toffee tapioca syrup organic sugar water pectin apple flavor full spectrum hemp extract so this is a full spectrum citric acid coconut oil red cabbage color sort of using the cabbage for the coloring this one has tumeric in here and contains coconut one thing I like about it they have batch numbers on the back of it the little batch of ID so he got was calling verified information and then it has a 10 character no calories there's no sodium here 2 grams of carbs 0 fiber 2 grams of sugar and each of these have 20 milligrams in dosage not better it's pretty good you know just feeling it this one from the inside it feels a lot more on the other shoe were a little bit more of a solid feel like if you're familiar with like those orange slice candies or things like that is a little thing this feels a little more on jelly like probably because of you know the pectin and the another stuff so let me just I'm looking at it here same thing mine's just colored with red radish color but it has cap yoga organic organic tapioca organic sugar water pectin cherry flavor natural full-spectrum hemp extract so that's one thing they list listed full spectrum so you know what you're getting off the top of the package without having to scan the QR citric acid coconut oil and red radish color and they put the thing contains coconut the one thing I think is pretty and has the QR code on the back I'm sorry about the lighting guys we're gonna get that fixed by next time but has a QR code on the back and the one thing I do like that I recommend to companies is the labeling on here it's a label they stick on afterwards the pageant's printed with the main you know logo what the product is this and that but on the back the ingredients and that kind of stuff in the batch they're two separate stickers so if anything ever changes or laws change you can real able you can change you're not stuck with a million packaging that's pre-printed when you need to switch something up or if you change your formula you know you're still it's still gonna call it a squib but it may have another ingredients night you just pop on these new labels on the back of the package so that was a smart decision for that vegan now I don't see anything here that's not vegan right and they don't come and say but based on what I see for those of you want a big an option I think this is a good it's a good way to go and like I say this because so many greenness is close to counter prized around gummies and those are vegan so one of the thing that I can tell you I love about this is that I can taste the full spectrum like like I'm so used to yep it's pretty cool right so cute I'm so used to taking CBD now like so many products I've tried I'm taste out that taste of they have in there so compared to the isolate I could tell you this actually has full spectrum based on the taste and that's just my experience over the past four years of trying so many different products I'm kind of like used to knowing like you taste it there so if you want a product that doesn't have that taste in there this is not for it but it's not a over women as some of the others that we've tried so I really like the squibs and these are coming a ten to get it you get a ten ten each and it's a eight eighteen dollars for a pack of one that has a ten inside of there which is not bad which is not bad no III just case but you can definitely case the the hemp but in a way I personally like that because you know you're getting something in it you know you know you're tasting the ham so you know what's in them um it's not as sweet as the others but it has a much easier to chew consistency I believe because of the pectin in there the way it's formulated I believe it is a vegan product I know it doesn't say it on there but it yeah I'm I'm pretty sure you could classify this as vegan based off of the ingredients good taste again I'm not I'm not gonna comment on how well it worked because this is only 20 milligrams which I know is not enough to probably do anything with tomatoes taking CBD on a daily basis I'm not to not do anything but to feel like a spike or a big effect you know and again we only have like a single dose size so I can't tell you how well the it works in the long run but it tastes good and as I think the healthiest ingredients of everything we've done was this so my kind of comparison of them is that cool if I go over just the three yeah okay so I would say hmm health-wise best for your health in my opinion is a squib the consistency is good I like that you're getting 20 milligrams and you gave the pricing you know everybody can make their own determination is it worth a little bit higher price to have all natural ingredients in too many people it is a lot of people pay more for organic foods and things too so there's that so it's it no it's a good product um second in line I would go with this pro leave it's not as healthy the ingredients for the squid but it's a lot better than most of the companies out there with high fructose corn syrups and stuff like that and you think I'm talking to myself am I can you guys hear me let me look in chat this way write a comment if you can here hello there you are disappearance Arvelo all right so back to this the UH the probe we've you know it's a good compromise in between the two I'd still say it's super it's pretty healthy looking at the ingredients I am so happy they actually took the time to label and um I haven't seen this in lolly glucose syrup they put wheat a lot of people just put glucose fructose sucrose they don't put wheat like it's weird it's derived from so if you have celiac or weed disorders that's that's good to know you know so I would say next in line is the pro leaf it is 50 milligrams it's a better price per milligram for the CBD then these other two products you get almost twice as much CBD for the same a little bit more on the price some of them you're getting double the CBD so Pearlie visit I would recommend that product with this one as far as case ingredients and lab tests that reached out I think I'm the squib lab test I'm not sure can you pull that up quick by chance or did you have a chance to look at that I just want to make compare the lab test for the three because I can't pull it up at the same time I closes a lady trying not bland that case I'm just getting in my phone yeah just do like if you're a consumer whatever pops up because I know it's gonna go to their landing page hey I did do that I didn't Redux I didn't wanna I just wanted to remain out of the lab tests come sir the scripts and the websites like slow I'm having problems open to be labs from the thing okay got it what's his full spectrum so I just wanna you know it says on their labeling which I'm glad it says that it's not like just fight overage cannabinoid or this or that nice what are we looking for we're looking for square 20 milligram I think I have another warning okay what does it say as far as its positional full-spectrum and does it show like pesticides microbials my toxins all that renders so milligram per gram point four zero four percent of total THC six point two three eight milligrams of CBD there is some Doulton line here they know Delta eight there is a CBC so it's point two eight two percent CBC so all this CBC here CBD and Delta 9 THC all right so we got four factor of okay which is great to see that something lines up with what the label and says that's because sometimes we've seen that it tells them to yeah and there's no test foreign like McNamara talks to reduce almonds the corn to lab reports it doesn't have that just shows you the counterbored content which is the poor to see so and so I know maybe they did maybe they didn't list it but if I was alchemy or the squib line I would definitely with the price point that it's at I would include all those lab tests because you're you know a lot of people when they start paying more than twenty thirty bucks for a product they want to see all that all that stuff that you did and it shows your customer that you you care you tested everything my Oh toxins microbials like a full panel and you know it's not that expensive to do a full panel when you're producing stuff in bulk it's not gonna add much to your cost but it's labeled correctly that's awesome it has a good consistency I like it okay now here's the last one rush rush nella a pocket real quick Shimon to link to the lab so another one because the one from the label goes to a different one than the one that was sent to me here so that one has a test for pesticides in your that wasn't this that's better so there's a CB d here c BD v CB n CB g CB c delta-9 so it has more so this one must be full pull the full range of the one has all more than one just Swift and not individual size so we'll have to look at this for you go ahead got him Dion degree Rhodes oh yeah I should say that Swift has the batch ID Anna so I'm sure each batch is made up you know the different distillate from a different crop whatever so they'll be a little different but at least a list that batch ID which is nice I'm the Frog I thought with all the sugars and everything else it would taste a little more sweet almost like a candy you know but it really didn't I guess there's not a huge amount of sugar but when you look at the corn syrup and sugar is the two main ingredients you would think it tastes sweet so it doesn't taste that sweet it's it's a little large you know it's almost the size of like a baby frog you'd catch you know your hand is a kid and play with it it's there's a little too big I think you could cut the size down on it um for somebody the little mouth it might be a lot to chew might take him a little while you know health-wise the ingredients yes they're on the bottom of the list it's pretty much all synthetic artificial different colors this and that but if you hey if you're into frogs or something novelty or you like frog legs give it a try I mean go after the lab tests did turn out on that one there they're like a full panel - I think I'm this one um so they do do their laptop game but again it's different strokes for different folks if he had really loves to eat stuff you know I don't think any of them are gonna satisfy your sweet tooth on these three but I don't know do the watering when it comes to gummies I just like to remind people that gummies are kind of like candy so it tastes good you unit thinking you you in I've seen people eat a lot of these in one day think think in that case it's really good to taste like candy you know it's like some sweet that we grew up with so to be mindful these are CBD in there so you take Emily's once or twice a day at the most because once you take too much you $1 check she sugar to you but she causes inflammation and the fact that when you take too much CBD the body only used so much so whatever that young mother body needs it's gonna flush out your system so the last one we have right is this a single line got a disposable Bay Pam and so when I have it it's not available the website it's a new string so I've been trying it out when I went to Florida and also to Maryland it's really great it's a Maui wowie and it's 500 milligrams of a of CBD in a point 5 ml it's so Marwari comes from salon raised strains from Hawaii it some use reported effects for creativity energetic focus you get more earthy flowery tobacco flavors and it's a lot of a better care feeling in this dish strain here compared to some of the others and I really like it it tastes really good I wanna sleep an apple but I'm more like a sweet flavor to it and one thing I like about it there's no there's a peach in there there's no VG in there there's no MCT and that's we've seen a lot of other big companies have that unnecessary ingredients I just determined and distillate which is wonderful and on the cost of this right here here's $40 there are many different strains so there's blueberry forbidden fruit", "zCnSgeRSkb0": "hey guys it's Brad from hemp remedies WWF remedies calm as I've mentioned in all the videos I am the owner of Hema teas which is one of the first

percent CBD and at 0.2% THC or less we're very excited about it as it is a certified varietal of industrial health and we will be able to plant it in the ground very soon we do are we are growing with leaps and bounds Tommy Chong is our brand ambassador we have some deals in the works right now with some other very big named famous people they also own a medical marijuana advertising and news

illegal because it's extracted from industrial hemp this is not a medical marijuana product however it does have the same CBD in it you get thirty squares inside of the container okay each square has approximately three milligrams of CBD in it so you're going to get 9g milligrams total in the box and they come in strawberry Kiwi green apple and pomegranate these are fantastic you know when you're using CBD you want to do your research we're not allowed to make any medical plans give any a medical advice or any dosage advice so it's definitely going to be your job to Google cannabidiol for whatever condition you have so say it's a-you know if you're curious if it will help a DD or autism you type in cannabidiol for a TD or autism and then you read the reports and you see how much CBD was given daily to get the desired results and then you know that in one of these is three milligrams so if you need you know ten milligrams a day you would want to take three or four of these at least so yeah with that being said you should also always check with your doctor I make no medical claims I'm not a physician you know but I can I can tell you that a single serving is one Square and

headquarters on this special I want to teach you about buying CBD on Amazon and what to expect so first can you really buy CBD on Amazon actually you cannot buy CBD on Amazon it is a restricted product and cannot be sold on Amazon and will give you a visual right now so if you go on to Amazon and you hit say key and CBD I'll be really general there's over 7,000 results for CBD let's just take a glance these are all pink atures oil tinctures they look just like CBD tinctures but if you look closely they all say hemp oil so they're not CBD or they're remarketed as CBD it's very deceiving anyone on the front end without a little bit of an educational look at these and click you know choose their flavor choose their milligram add it to cart and buy it but as you scroll down and you see all the product that comes up when you hit CBD you'll notice they also have CBD gummies they have the CBD oil but you'll notice something distinct over here everything says hemp and not CBD so basically two things are happening over here number one you could also look at the milligrams whether it's oil tank atures or the gummies and notice that they have an awfully high milligram over here like three hundred and fifty thousand milligrams for sixty pieces of gummies I mean you're talking tons of milligrams per gummies had this been authentic information or 400,000 milligrams in gummies or half a million milligrams in a tiny little one milliliter bottle of oil so as a professional looking at this you know or manufacturers looking at this they must be saying to myself how could people be buying this junk and so am i and that's the reason why I'm here to explain that these pain creams hemp creams and gummies and tinctures that they're all talking about over here really don't do much and in fact they're going to confuse you as a user thinking I found a natural alternative remedy for pain anxiety and sleep and etc but you did not find CBD you will not be trying CBD and another thing to think about is when these companies like these are using ingredients in their products and they say they're using hemp air on the side of caution because most of the hemp in these types of products used by these types of manufacturing companies are usually filled with pesticides and used if you're a farmer and you know and you could relate that hemp is used to absorb all the metals and pesticides so that they could plant and have a healthy harvesting again so what happens is they end up with a ton of hemp and they know the CBD industry is blowing up and they go to companies and offer them these deals for this type of hemp and that's what you're putting in your body moving on if you're a seller and you tried to list you know real authentic CBD you'll get a notification restricted products removal which essentially means you know warning we're either in a suspend your account forever or you know take this as a warning and remove all those products because these products are identified as prohibited CBD or cannabis oil product I hope you all learn something today and please feel free to comment and stay tuned for more about buying CBD on Amazon

brother and sister but we're also something else we're both about that fit life welcome to btfl it's your man earl batman stringer and in this video we talking about hemp gummies a game all right i just tried another uh brand of hemp gummies now about maybe a couple months ago i tried the uh the eclipse brand of their hemp gummies and it was pretty good you know i mean i talked about my experiences with it so i took a little time off then i decided to try another brand of the hemp gummies and these are from a new age all right you can check out the bottle right here boom boom boom all right so the cool thing about the new age is they actually give you two bottles right just in case you look at this you're like dog this is full you ain't try these i'm almost done with the first bottle so when you get these you actually get them you like together they give you two bottles um i think i paid around 30 bucks maybe a little over 30 bucks i'm not sure obviously i will link these below if you want to check these out i got them from amazon so link will be below you can check them out for yourself if you want to um but anyway these are the new age hemp gummies now a lot of people take gummies hemp gummies for multiple reasons but usually when you talk about hemp or the whole cbd thing usually people take them for two reasons one is for pain right and for two they usually use it for calming or helping them with sleep like those are the things that i notice people taking for the most me personally i kind of was getting into the him thing just more for the sleep thing right i don't sleep enough which is the issue i need to work on i'm trying to work on so i've been taking these uh you know about an hour or two before i go to sleep and um that's why you know always looking at him products and you know things like that um and i gotta say with these i like these i do like these i feel like they do help me sleep um they actually do help me like feel a little more relaxed even compared to the eclipse uh hemp gummies i talked about how i felt like they they made me sleep a little a little deeper i felt these i feel like when i take two of these and you probably could take even three if you want to i feel like you know they don't make you be like after you take some right but i feel like when i take them say i go to bed at like 2 30 in the morning i usually take these around 1 12 30 or 1. and i notice like you know just kind of like i'm chilling on the computer doing some stuff i'm like all right yeah i'm i'm ready to go to bed like not like i'm just you know like it hit me but i just feel like it's like a smooth progression i notice with these and i and i sleep really really good now keep in mind maybe it's because i sleep really good because i go to bed late and i get it pretty early i don't know but i i will say i notice a little more uh calmness sleepy effect more with these than i did with the eclipse uh hemp gummies right that's my experience with these now one real quick you're the dog in the background scratching themselves that's my guy that's my guy anyway these are what these look like alrighty about this big um one thing i will say compared to the um compared to the eclipse brand these do have more of an aftertaste effect than the eclipse i'm keeping it real like these do get you like it's not terrible but some people might not like the aftertaste of these especially if you take two of these um you may notice like like that little aftertaste depends on how you feel about that but you definitely get it out eating these like straight up the taste the taste is good you know with these but you do get this little aftertaste that's like but they're still good you know it tastes definitely it's cool but the aftertaste all right so that's my take on these him gummies guys i feel like if you're trying to use them for maybe relaxation or helping with your sleep i definitely say check these bad boys out um you can comment below if you taking another kind of brand comment below i like to check it out you know what i'm saying you know get my opinion on it all right that's my tape you want to check them

help out in the video I'm gonna have to ask you to sit still there buddy so I can get you in focus all right good job whoa there whoa there okay now we're gonna focus all right so anyway we are going to review these gummies I will tell you going in my expectations for these were that the melatonin would be less effective than the CBD gummies I think that's just because we've tried melatonin in the past in the tenth year form and I think what happened is because it went straight to the bloodstream because it was in liquid form it kind of had like a flash in the pan effect where it worked very briefly everyone got tired because we tried it on all of us and it worked for a couple hours at the beginning of the night but towards early morning people started waking up early and everything like that because the effects have worn off I think the melatonin and gummy form is a much better idea simply because it slowly disperses throughout the digestive system over time being digested in the stomach rather than going straight to the bloodstream that's just my theory but I think that's what's happening and as such these have been the most effective melatonin gummies that we've had so as you can see we have been using these gummies a lot all of us have we try not to treat our kids like guinea pigs or anything like that so Britney and aya Brittney is my wife we try these things out before we give them to our children as much as possible unless it's their medications of course IANS on medication for his autism he's on risperidone and of course we don't take that because I think that would be illegal but any chance we get we try to try things out before giving them to our kids and hey buddy so yes it has been very effective we love the melatonin gummies as you can see with the other one can you show me the CBD ones in there's a lot more in there Ian says that they have been pretty effective for him is that what you said Ian you find that they help you and he's behind the mic actually have that mic facing me so you probably can't hear him too well to help you be is that what you said earlier give me come just a little bit just a little bit just teeny bit okay hope you guys could hear that now a lot of people get concerned when they hear about CBD because it is the cousin of cannabis of marijuana and so they get worried that has THC in it I asked the manufacturers of this brand if it had any traces of THC in it they said no and on a federal level that's what you want to hear because the DEA is still really strict about stuff like that we don't want Child Protective Services coming at our door and knocking things down just because you know what our kids had like point zero 3 percent THC or whatever we tried this out in Nevada in liquid form and a different brand and Ian said then that it was it was helpful but it was kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul because what had happened is he his tempers and his meltdowns were less severe but they were more frequent so it was just kind of trading one thing for the other it didn't really I mean at first we thought it was helping us out but he was on vacation so he was more relaxed and so that's kind of I think where we noticed him being relaxed a little bit more yep but overall we just didn't like just that it didn't really do much and as far as these gummies are concerned I didn't notice a lot of difference in Ian when I took him and my wife took them we didn't notice a lot of difference in ourselves so I I'm not talking bad about this brand I think it's different strokes for different folks some people really find that CBD helps them we had a neighbour she said that when she took CBD she felt nervous she didn't know if that was in her head or not that's close buddy that is very close thank you you can take some out Ian if you want to take some dummies out other people we have heard said they really like CBD it has helped them out a lot so again different strokes for different folks your mileage may vary really you got to find out for yourself I think this is a great way to start bless you this is a great way to start because it has no THC in it at all it's a very safe brand and that's something we like we could actually try this out here in Utah because there's no THC we're not really worried about the DEA you know again coming down knocking down our door asking us questions because it falls well below the point one percent mark most excuse me most CBD stuff falls below the 0.3% this is zero percent according to the email I got alright let's see here hands gonna show us these gummies okay hold still hold still so I can get it in focus this has a very shallow depth of field so yeah they sent us these and in full disclosure they did send us these to keep and to try out that does not change our view on our review it doesn't change our view on our review as far as you know being honest about these I hope you guys know that I'm being very honest if we were just trying to get away with something and get money off of these we would tell you how amazing these gummies were and they're perfect in every way but what I'm telling you is this one is a hit the melatonin one and this one just kind of may that's been our experience this one didn't really do that much for us whereas the this one the melatonin one we really loved we were running out of this and we want more so we're hooked alright yen so you wanna put those back and I'll show you guys some pictures of the ingredients and things like that so you know what cinema took some pictures of the bottles anyway this stuff has been great the melatonin er excuse me Allister our youngest son was having really hard time getting to sleep he'd wake up multiple times in the night wake us up wake his brothers up just kind of be bouncing around the house annoying everybody and this has been an answer to our prayers right here as a matter of fact Brittany and I and a kind of confession time have taken energy drinks off and on just to make it throughout the day we have three boys on the autism spectrum and we do not get a lot of sleep this has helped with that it's helped us to get bed earlier and to feel better and wake up more revived I'm not generally one of those people who promotes stuff like this again they reached out to us and send it our way and I feel like you know a vast majority or maybe not a majority but a lot of stuff out there is just snake oil and it's just garbage that people put out there and promote and then they say that it's some from some fruit extracted from Tahiti or some foreign region or some remote island in Fiji and I mean you guys know the drill there's a lot of stuff out there on the market that makes all these promises and I'm telling you just from a very practical standpoint this stuff works really well and has helped us a lot with sleep help their sons get sleep and I mean for the price I think they're like I want to say $15 a bottle currently really not a bad price a good night's sleep is definitely worth a lot of money in my opinion if you guys have ever stared stayed at a hotel or air B&B that has been super noisier there's been partiers or drunk people next door or people slamming doors or going over downstairs long story short you you guys know what it's like to wake up in the morning and be just bone tired because you got a bad sleep and that's why we've we really like this stuff it's helped us a lot anyway I think I've said enough there YouTube has still disabled our comments because we have children on our channel and I know you guys probably have a lot of questions I would reach out to the company for questions again it's yummy is the name of the company and yeah I think I about covered everything oh they taste great both of them these ones are a strawberry flavor as you can see there these ones are a grape flavor yeah great we love them", "nz-pbA19-7s": "[Music] get the best natural organic cbd

you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to a friend subscribe here baby juice TV and stick as a comment

where the audience is standing and explain a little bit about the short clips that are making first off we've been selling CBD for well over four years there's thousands and thousands of brands out there that keep contacting us and tell us to sell their product it's the best there's so much confusion out there we wanted to start this channel to let you know what we keep seeing customers come back and buy what they tell us works for sleep anxiety pain insomnia they don't like gummies they want a solution for capsules they they're not into capsules they like oils they like oils but what's the difference between broad spectrum and full spectrum what's MCT oils but we wanted to put together a station that we could try and make these live streams and explain a little bit about CBD explain to you the differences the options you have for all different types and we're gonna go into it right now just give us a second change screens over here this is our youtube station where we're making different videos for full-spectrum oils MCT oils broad spectrum and they might look like ads to you guys but they really used to call out products our customers love and keep buying from us we try to make little notes throughout these little slideshows or videos how many to take two to three before you go to sleep on a specific sleep gummy how much is in a bag 150 milligram means or 300 milligram means and we want to bring you to our site if you went to CBD headquarters calm you can go to our site and look at all these products but find this on Google you'll find us on Leafly or find us on Yelp you'll find this in YouTube and to the wrong one and it there but if you go to the site it'll take a second to load there is a prompt screen to make sure that you're 18 years or older once that loads you could use the top nav shop here it is just clicked yes you could shop look at all the products go through oil tinters and only look at those same thing for capsules etc had products edibles topicals it's gone back to edibles it's a very large category so we tried to make it simple for the people that want to buy vegan edibles people that can eat gluten sorry they're in certain products and need kosher certification or halal certification we found gummies in our lines that we see customers buying that they like that tastes great that worked great aim thing for gluten-free if you have a gluten free diet we did that and if you want to find Pacific uses we went ahead and made a sleep section so skipping over all of this we could go quickly to talking a little bit about the differences on edibles what different types of edibles are there what ones are available and we're going to play a short clip and then you could talk about [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sunstate hem here they are on the site you could go very easily to the edible section or better yet from the homepage if you were on the home page you could click here to go to the home page and you wanted to shop by brand and you went down towards the bottom and just say for example chose sunstate that's how I got to that page and I'm sorry I'm being a little repetitive for those of you that are quicker than others but not everyone is of the same age demographic ties we see so these were the penguin gummies they're great for sleep you just saw the video same thing for the fruit slices they have melatonin and you saw all the other great ones from sour apple peach blue raspberry sour packs and bears this video is on YouTube but look at the different options we're gonna play another quick strip of videos for other edibles just to give you guys an idea you less expensive [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right so you just saw the 500 milligram Jaws by sun state with melatonin and a bunch of great flavors grape varieties great value also for just 20 bucks if you want to take the edge off at night and chew on a delicious gummy for 20 bucks the video before was 30 bucks 750 milligrams and now we're gonna go into your CBD edibles for gluten-free and vegan [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but capsules [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so you just saw some CBD capsules those are doctor formulated CBD capsules so they're not your average CBD capsule that you see in your CBD store your vitamin shop online these were specifically formulated for four different types of uses to relax and fall asleep you've got to sleep capsules and then you have for energy if your that's the one we just played need a boost of energy any time of the day these things are great let's take two of them and then they make a stress and a relief for inflammation all four of these are available on monthly supplies and daily doses for just five dollars each and we're going to back to the video and show you the other capsules that are available [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but we also have two more capsules and just to stay on the line with you guys over here before we play the other videos for the capsules I want to let you know what's coming up after the capsules it'll be CBD oils the different types of oils will go over MCT oils won't go over broad-spectrum and even full-spectrum and we'll even show you the new CBG which is killing it and probably amazing for this quarantine time given as Kovach 19 outbreak it'll naturally build up your immune system but let's finish up with the capsules I prepared these videos for you just to quickly give you a snapshot [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and you'll be able to see each one of them I just want to give everyone a chance to see a little bit about everything moving on to our oils [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so you just saw the CBG oils I just want to talk quickly about them you could type CBG at the top of the search bar right over here and look for them or you could go into them directly by clicking on the oil Inc at your section if you want to learn more about each of any of these products that we're talking about there's big juicy pictures and descriptions about everything on our site we're going to talk a little bit about these because there's a one to one ratio of CBG to CBD which is unlike just about anyone putting CBG out on the market they're usually sixty to one ratio or twenty to one which means a one to one of a 1000 milligram tincture will have 500 milligrams of CBD and 500 milligrams of CBG if you clicked on read more you'll see all the details you could scroll down and go as crazy as you want with the weights the amounts the recommended dosages and now we're gonna spin the wheel a second and talk about a different CBD oil [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we just showed you the full spectrum bottles is definitely the strongest DBD full spec bottles that we wanted to show you guys with avocado oils you could read in detail over here or on our site about these great oils again you could go into each one and look at the pictures and more details you go to youtube and you could watch our videos it's right over here the broad spectrum we're gonna show you another full spectrum sorry we've shown you the wrong one right here um going to show you another full spectrum those were not flavored I'm going to show you one that is flavored that's amazing from funky farms hopefully your lackeys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you guys got to see a good variety so far we showed you the CBG oils right over here we showed you the full spec with avocado oil and the funky form flavored CBD oils which are great just taking him right in your mouth there the flavors great orange dream is like the orange popsicle Alaskan ice is the peppermint and lemon lime on pretty much says it all we're gonna show you the next oil which is a broad spectrum so what we just covered the CBG which was the strongest and then the full spec with avocado oil and Thank You farms and now we're going to show you the broad spec [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right so we again covered CBG we covered full spec with avocado be covered full spec that's flavored funky farm and we just covered the broad spectrum and of course we've got so much product we can't cram it all into one video so we'll definitely make some time for original hemp these are doctor formulated CBD oils they're full-spectrum these little vanilla guys are amazing a calm you down and help you get sleep berry is the opposite it's an upper it helps give you energy and the green is of course natural so it's our full all-around exotic full spec I'm going to show you another quick video on the MCT oils which get absorbed a lot quicker and give you almost instant energy because of all the fats that they have in their help when in conjunction with the CBD get ingested quicker there's three different types and just give it a second for the video [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right I jumped into full-screen mode you vapors have been screaming babe babe babe babe so we put together quick bait pens which vape pens can you use for both CBD and THC carts that are prefilled we put you these cool instructions when you go on the website and you click on vape pens how to use them by some quick three times to change the voltage five times on and off we gave you a recommendation of one that works amazing cross borders CBD or THC if you're in LA and you're or you got a medical marijuana card bunkie Farms is another battery that you could use with their carts but if you went ahead and clicked on these you can choose any color they ship fast they work great they last all day even though they're small and if you lost one under your car seat or your couch and need one this is a great place to replace them you could use these print them out and use them as a reference come back and learn how to use your pens when you forget gonna play a quick video of the available vape pens and then we're gonna move into topicals and that'll sum it up after that so let's just go to the vape specials there's a code you enter the promo code and your free shipping [Music] you all right so topicals there are so many topicals on the market but there's not so many for this price that works this fast with so much relief probably saw the videos on YouTube definitely trending right now you could go into this section and click on topicals and scroll down and look through all the companies that we heavily vetted before we put them up online and you'll you'll notice that even then there's a tremendous amount the Kalki's are great for athletes that get tested that can't show any THC hemp lucid also makes great body butters you know one ounce you could get for a hundred fifty bucks and 1000 milligrams creating better days forty five dollar price range these are great for stretch marks and serenity lotion and the pain cream is also nano CBD by creating but it days these are all the massages lotions that you find on the site whether the eucalyptus or their lavender jasmine and Clementine you have the bay leaf and the lemongrass and sage and the pain creams so they come different you know labels it's the same exact product I'm gonna play a quick video clip to show you about the topicals and hopefully you're enjoying this and give us some comments [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right this concludes our program I hope you all liked it and give us some comments give us some likes so we know to keep doing this or to focus our energies elsewhere thank you for watching [Music]", "gvnGHtKYzvg": "strawberry Sequoia here today I'm going to review three products by Charlotte's Web have here the hemp extract infuse gummies their sleep our tincture which is their original formula mint chocolate teacher also their capsules so their head pot souls start with these sleep dummies really really liked these they are 10 milligrams apiece and they suggest that you eat to a person they are raspberry flavored which is done by eat sugar I believe some ingredients aren't too bad TTE oil fruit and vegetable juice for color so it's got 3 grams of sugar it's also got melatonin so that's what makes it so great for sleep my husband and I both tried these and we found that after taking even just one we fell asleep pretty much immediately my only issue with these is some nights that I have them I found myself falling asleep everytime perfectly but maybe not sleeping all the way through the night that could be so many different factors if your problem is falling asleep I would highly suggest these Charlotte's Web Stanley Brothers 10 milligram raspberry flavor hemp extract used gummies for sweet next up we have got their tincture so this tincture is a 50 milligram suture gluten-free non-gmo vegan made with coconut oil organic mint chocolate flavored oils four flavors it's five calories I was a little bit confused about this wrapper which doesn't actually have any limes or anything like that and so that should be one full dropper should be point 5 milliliters it's just a little confusing on like what the actual dosage is and my dropper doesn't work I don't know it came that way and I fix it so I was just kind of like taking shots off the bottle it tastes alright um it covers up kind of ahem flavor but not totally I still kind of have to wash it down with some water um one day I took kind of a pretty big swig of this and I honestly felt like I got high so I do feel like it's effective I just I'm a little confused about the dosing my dropper didn't work and it doesn't really taste that great but I do think it's effective so if you're a tincture person I would try it last but not least the capsules so they come in the little bottle like this and they're 20 milligram plant-based can I have no it's per capsule same kind of thing so the ingredients are extra-virgin olive oil and the vegetable capsule and other than that it's just extract it says to take one capsule up to two times daily I really like the capsule dose a it avoids the kind of icky flavor that a lot of tinctures love it just gets straight to the source and I thought these were very effective if I take two I definitely feel that heightened sense of like euphoria and even a little high which I don't normally feel the CVE and maybe their specific plants that they use or cannabinoid blends just works for my unknown cannabinoid system for taking one essentially you just would feel like a little calm and anti-anxiety taking - I really could actually feel the effects of CBD huge I don't usually I think they're a really great product well I was afraid about with Charlotte's Web they are kind of one of the og bigger companies now if you don't know their story started out with a really great mission to help a young girl who had severe epilepsy and so they were growing medical grade hemp before a lot of people really ever were and so they made this specific product for Charlotte and it really helps with her seizures so it's they started out beautifully they grew now into a much bigger company so I was really nervous that they their products would suffer because of their blow but I don't think that's the case of all these all seem really high quality I mean like medical grade CBD from my experience with them they were they were wonderful everybody's endocannabinoid system is different so I encourage you to look at the batch that you're getting and always check the COA but overall I was impressed I did not think I was gonna like these so much so feeling really good about that thank you for watching you can read all of our reviews and check us out at Mary Jane experience comm we're on every social media platform that there is so checks up

Controlled Substances Act the UC or the US CSA got that covered too in the fact sheet and then there's some trademark stuff here made in Los Angeles flip it over shake before each use for best results you do want to do that any time you get CBD in a liquid form you want to shake it because some separation will occur during shipping or just leaving it sit some residue is natural which is true if you use a tank you will get some residue in the tank again not a big deal suggested use for a tank one to two droppers pool for a dripper one and a half to one droppers pool for a tank rich in the central omega-3 fatty acids and amino acids hashtag feel the difference and boom we're back around to the front now that being said here is the 500 alright you'll see it's a little bit different but as far as the box goes other than the colors this is 500 milligrams per 10 mil versus 300 milligrams for 10 mil but other than that you know it's just kind of flip-flop and both it's basically the same so I won't go through the same you know go through the box again with you I just wanted to show it to you so we'll set it off to the side and pop a bottle out alright so here is your bottle CBD FX 300 milligram 10 ml bottle as you can see this liquid is a little bit darker if you want to go back and check the 60 and 120 milligrams bottles you'll see this has a little more obviously a higher concentrate of CBD in it so it is going to be a little bit darker roll it around ingredients obviously there's CBD propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin and it is manufactured in Los Angeles California roll it around shake before you choose for best results we already covered that and again don't forget some residue is natural and it is made in the USA and we're back around to the front now let's go ahead and try so here's the bottle basically what you're gonna do is gonna come child say if you wrap in plastic just go around the top here until you find the perforation which it is double perforated so I gotta do click it boom strip comes off and then everything comes out grab ahold of it shake it like they say alright the reason you want to do that again is to get everything mixed back up like it's supposed to be bone alright so your as you can see instead of being kind of see-through now it's kind of like cloudy milky a little bit push down on the bottle and spin and there you go all right kind of almost reminds me of like orange juice in that consistency so let's try I just put a little bit under my tongue you know that's CBD if you've never experienced CBD before it does have a bit of an earthy flavor too it's the best way I can describe it I don't really know how else to describe it unless you've actually tried it if you have a better word for it dropping in the comments below I don't know how else to describe if flavor is a big thing for you check out the website check out my other videos they do have gummy bears which tastes just like cherry or like a cherry fruit punch to me and they've got sugar in it which is nice to check out the chill shots lemonade awesome and then they also have some hemp capsules which have absolutely no taste to them at all so if taste is gonna be one of those things where you're like oh god I don't like the taste that's fine there's other products CBD FX makes other products that you can try with still you know still has CBD in it so you're good you're good we got your family we got you now as promised thanks chief alright so you may have heard that CBD is illegal well it's not and here's why non-psychoactive hemp was deemed illegal by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 ok there's number one there hemp biomass which is basically the hemp crop that they derive the CBD from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security so if Homeland Security said it's cool cool they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants very important and we'll get to that in a minute product meet this the CBD FX products that contains CBD meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to have less than 0.3 percent THC in it okay now because all of the stuff I've already mentioned their products are exempt from the CSA and DEA drug scheduling practices which classify whole hep extracts as schedule one drugs why because extracts from the stocks of EU European okay European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so boom legal nothing to worry about alright plans simple they figured out how CBD FX figured out how to get you a legal CBD awesome right that's what I'm saying now you're probably a nice thing does it work it's probably why you're even watching the video does it work doesn't work does work I can't say whether it were it will work for you I'm not allowed to because the FDA says I'm not allowed to alright but what I can tell you is my own personal experiences but I use CBD for the following reasons when I go to bed my head doesn't shut off alright I am up for hours afterwards thinking about this that the other thing flipping through a social media looking at my phone etc if you are one of those people there's a strong chance that might work for you because it helps me that way I am NOT a YouTube millionaire so therefore I do have to have a day job at my day job I work in a factory I do a lot of walking across concrete floors I do a lot of climbing the ladders and all that other fun stuff so therefore when I come home my feet hurt my knees hurt my ankles hurt my back hurts everything hurts alright you reach a certain age when you go out into the real world get a job and everything's not provided for you and then you realize what those jobs come aches and pains boom enter CBD alright takes the edge off the aches and pains for me it's right up there with an ibuprofen and I don't even like taking that because that'll screw with your liver it works for me I don't go to the doctor I hate the doctor I don't like Big Pharma's pills and agendas being shoved down my throat and all that other crap so I prefer natural type stuff all right smell as natural as you get you may see on some other videos out in YouTube land or on the internet of people saying well it didn't work for me okay it might not have okay it doesn't work for everybody okay there is nothing that's 100% in this world other than death and taxes but keep in mind those may also be the people that well I'm gonna try some took some oh well it didn't work immediately or it didn't work exactly the way I thought it was going to so therefore it doesn't work and I'm gonna tell everybody it doesn't work well that's not necessarily true okay if you go to the doctor they give you a prescription tell you to take one pill you take one pill it doesn't work do you automatically stop taking it or do you call the doctor and say hey the one pill is not working if you do say that what's he gonna say well then take two all right take it you know they're or they'll figure it out until you get to a point where whatever they prescribe you works okay the right dosage same thing with this play with it okay you got to figure out what dosage works for you the suggested one dropper might not work for you you might need to one dropper and you might be like wow I feel amazing let me try a half dropper and a half dropper full might work for you okay play with it all right it's all about you okay it's all about what works for you give it a chance if you don't give it a chance then you'll probably one of the haters that's putting comments you know on the internet so if you want some and I don't suggest you try something like I said this is the more high-powered stuff if you've got bigger issues going on and again unfortunately I can't necessarily say what it will work for with the FDA but do your own research okay look at other people's testimonials about it okay and if you have some of the symptoms that they have and the 60 and 120 didn't really work for you try the 300 of the 500 all right yeah boom there's the 500 so just remember look for either the gold box or the purple box all right try it just get do yourself a favor and try it alright that's all I ask for you if you're worried about you know I said it helps me shut my mind off notice I didn't say it makes me drowsy I can take this in the morning and be 100% fine the rest of the day alright just puts me on a nice even keel and I'm good to go so don't worry about any of that so if you want to try something here's what I suggest you do check the description below you're gonna find a link to both products directly on the website click the button a couple times puts in your basket pays for it Bo

beautiful journey and show you my lab results explain everything then show you the good and bad everything I find on this company but I don't feel comfortable doing that with this one because well I'll just show you you can still see my lab tests in the link to this review in the description below but let's just move to to the warning my tests were fine the product was expensive and not quite accurate but here's the problem I found several products from diamond CBD were found to contain a dangerous chemical linked to emergency room admissions paranoia panic attacks increased heart rate and blood pressure and even death the compound is called 5f ADB and is referred to as synthetic marijuana it's synthetic marijuana on the street it's called spice or k2 and it's showing up in neighborhoods across the nation the drug is so strong people go into a zonked out state sometimes it can even turn peaceful people into crazies New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton these

chemicals that are in it can really destroy the brain cells in your brain and you're not coming back from that Wow I don't know what else to say this was published in November 2018 so I hope they've changed their products since then I mean my tests were fine so maybe they did change everything and everything's fine now but I don't know how you get past this as a company they've got over 31 complaints with the Better Business Bureau and an F rating from the Better Business Bureau I don't like showing you these reports I believe in CBD and reports like this just lead to more regulation the CBD drug for epilepsy is over seven dollars per milligram of CBD and it's essentially just CBD there's good products that are under seven cents per milligram of CBD not seven dollars and it's getting cheaper but it won't if if we have more regulation the pharmaceuticals won't go down they'll they'll go up for essentially the same thing in the same review the links below you can see some of

so this is the Dakota mix or X product I've bought this about 1 months ago and been taking two of these gummies everyday of course especially for pain and other things which I relate to fibromyalgia and if you want to know if it worked yeah I mean the quick answer is no so but I'm still going a little bit into my experience now in detail so I had bought two bottles I took two gummies every day one in the morning one late at night so before sleep and the NSA you should take I think to some people say they take four I think the recommendation official recommendation is one or two so I think I took definitely enough but there are a couple of things which are a problem with this listing or with this product actually it could be interesting before you buy I mean could be interesting to know for you before you buy something like that because there are a lot around I mean you can find so many of these things but what this is what I have found so far I mean the thing is there are a couple of things with really low value immediate sounds like a lot here it says 1500 milligrams 25 milligrams per gummy so how much is it really when you compare it to just hemp oil I mean you can buy hemp oil like a bottle like a little for maybe 20 dollars or so you have to know and when you buy one liter that means 1 1 million milligram so if you just buy oil you can get 1 million milligrams for $20 and here for $25 you get 2 times 1,500 milligrams so three thousand in total 3 thousand instead of 1 million so you get maybe an idea how much benefit you can expect I mean I'm not saying these gummy bears or bad I mean they taste really good 100% like original gummy bears and also they are sweetened with really good sweetener like an organic one I'm going to show that later on that's really good but really the hemp inside and yeah you also have to know I mean hemp that's not CBD I mean a lot of people here that like about benefits regarding pain and anxiety and all those things and usually these things are related to CBD and yeah it's not so much coming from normal hemp oil which doesn't have any kind of CBD so this is a different thing and also hemp oil I mean that's basically just a little bit of hemp oil in gummy bears and also hemp oil comes with some things which you maybe don't want to have like a lot of vitamin b12 which could cause a skin problems like acne and so on if you take too much you have to be careful about that but for me this or like just more or less very expensive coming bears and yeah what they say also they are talking about not Bund ins of nutrients and vitamins and omega 3 6 9 fatty amino acids and so on so when I was checking the box I mean the the back label yet the thing is actually here on the Amazon listing we don't find anything about the back label there's nothing about that usually you can expect that on an Amazon listing to see the bank label but here it is not so I'm going to show you that I've made a couple of pictures so you can see that if you're missing that and you see that there's not much I mean I can't see anything about vitamins and a lot of other good things most of the stuff is on zero and also protein and there's really nothing about white amines and though things which they are mentioning in the Amazon listing also these omega oils and so there's nothing and I've been asking the seller if they can provide me some information about that and that's also more than two weeks ago and they have delivered nothing so maybe that's even nothing inside so not only disappointing from the inside also disappointing regarding the service absolutely disappointing also the bottle yeah we have some more pictures I mean that's some part of it with recommendations and so on lettuce a yeah take one to two gummies and yeah here again the back label that's different that's the same which you can see on Amazon and that's the two bottles I mean they come perfectly sealed which is nice and then you open the lid and inside of the lid that was actually another late like a removable lead and that's usually supposed to seal properly on top of the bottle itself but it was not really sealed down it was not really properly glued down it was so somehow like half sticking on the bottle and half on the lid so that was also very disappointing so I just dumped it into trash and removed it because it didn't stick on the in the lead and didn't stick here so really useless so when you check for all the products I mean alternate products regarding hemp gummies I mean there are other listings which claim they have much higher values like here we have three 350,000 or even more here we can see in nine hundred thousand instead of one thousand five hundred I mean that would probably be a total different thing but I'm not saying it's a game-changer maybe it's just a little bit I mean it's not so much I mean I've been taking hemp oil like from the bottle the normal liquid hemp oil and it also didn't do a lot I mean really not a noticeable so I don't expect a lot and by the way I think some of these listings are even cheating I mean 900 milligrams would mean if I'm not wrong 900 grams but I mean 60 piece of hemp gummies they are not 900 grams I mean that's almost 2 pounds that's way too much so that's almost impossible I don't see that happening and you can see most of the other listings are way lower like usually around three hundred thousand five hundred thousand yeah if I give it another try would definitely stick with something around that maybe 400 thousand three hundred four hundred five hundred thousand and probably not one with nine hundred fifty thousand because I think that's not real and yeah I mean when you and you see at the reviews a lot of reviews are also not good I mean they have a lot of good reviews but I think a lot of them are fake I mean it's trying the product and so a lot of people are buying they know that and they pay for a lot of yeah paid reviews so you cannot believe all the things which are there in the five-star reviews they're probably way too much 5-star reviews so from my side I cannot really recommend them especially not this brand here definitely I would say stay away from the Dakota mix or X but also I mean I don't know if something like that really working probably just very expensive commie bears and if you want to have some real benefit from this weed plant you would have to go with CBD I think you need like prescription in most of the states in u.s. but just hemp I mean for me now after trying the pure oil and the gummy bears I it just didn't do anything and I mean the all the things here inside you I better go to the pictures from my side what's inside like the organic tapioca syrup which is the sweetened I mean that's a good thing I've been doing some research on that and most people say yeah that's one of the best sweetness if you want to use a sweetener you use this one yeah it's most healthy or least unhealthy so I think the recipe is good but I don't see any real benefit not I mean I don't see even though might amines not the Omega thing and you could buy white amines and Omega way cheaper so and commi bears as well so I don't see any need to buy something like that or definitely stay away so if you have other opinion on that other experience something like overnight miracle will be really really interesting to learn from you if you have anything I mean also any other questions or comments please write everything down into the feedback area most happy to talk about these things and if you liked the video give me a thumbs up subscribe my channel thanks for watching and see you next time [Music]", "BExdUz59WPI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey y'all hey y'all was good luck miss Michelle no is sugar show Yugi and back with another video so in today's video I will be featuring a CA use a new CBD product that I have been using so I'm y'all this video is sponsored by on Cali and they had the pleasure of sending me some some of their CBD gummies and then some of their cvz lip balm so I'm going to be sharing my experience of me using these I've been using these for about a week you know y'all when I get a product I always want to make sure I test it out first before doing a video on it so I want to test these out and use a photo leaked just to see how my experience is and I'm gonna be telling y'all what I've been experiencing and what I've been noticing since it's since I've been taking these gummies and then I also been using the lip balm to and I'm glad they sent me this because I'd be needing like some lip gloss and stuff so I bring this this up close like I can kind of see or whatever is that that's just the lip balm and it's just a regular peach pinky color and this smells been really good so to the room nitty-gritty which is the gummies but I really want to talk about these gummies okay so um actually I want to take one right now but alright so you're supposed to take two a day only two and if gum means they are made from USA growing hemp the hemp plant they are so freaking good y'all like when I tell y'all these are so good like they taste like those look I can't think of the name of the candy but it tastes like those little gummy candies and they're so freakin good you're only supposed to take super day I know when you hear CBD you think of getting high right because it comes from the actual but no this does not make you hot but I will tell y'all what it has been doing for me and just some of the things like if you decide to buy this product I'm just gonna be telling you guys what to watch out for and what to expect when buying it and when using these this I have to break this a 10 out of 10 in y'all before I get into my experiences I want to do a little bit more information about this product so just to give a little background information on it or whatever so the first thing about this product it helps with anxiety so if you have trouble trying to like stay calm trying to relax this product definitely will help with get it helps you to relax and I'm going to get more into that from what I experienced so with me taking these first of all I really would recommend you taking the midnight and let me show you why so when I take them I always take two at the same time or if I don't think so let's take one morning and one at night but most of the time I'm taking two at the same time and what this does y'all is it for me I know this like after taking it maybe like maybe 10 15 minutes after taking it I'm super drowsy like I'm super tired I'm really relaxed like I want to take a nap and go to sleep so this parlor definitely helps you to just relax and you know just feel so calm cool and collected so that's why that's why I say if you are somebody that you don't want to be tired or tools you know calm and relaxed during the day also I suggest you take this at night right before bed because guess what it does help with your sleep as will it helps you to just sleep easily peacefully calmly salute like I'm turning off this part that makes you feel so relaxed like I just would advise you to take it before bed at night you have to go to sleep anyway because if you take it during the day let's say you gotta go to work you're gonna be at work so drowsy so and when I say drowsy I don't mean I got bad drowsy I mean like it's just gonna be like it looks higher you know I'm saying like you're gonna be a little relaxed you're gonna want to like lay down chill and go to bed property and go to sleep but that's just my experience with this that's one thing that's the number one thing I haven't noticed I'm gonna be checking this is my sleep has been so much better and it makes me sleepy right after it but it makes me super relaxed super calm so I highly recommend on like I said it definitely helps with anxiety if you have that if you have trouble trying to stay relaxed and trying to sleep this product definitely helped me out so yeah like another common issue that can prevent you from like relaxing always sleep man and sometimes it can be pain like if you're aching or just any type of pain that said to like an injury maybe maybe now I haven't been in pain so I can't really say you know if it's been suited any pain um I work out on the daily so I don't really be in pain or whatever but it definitely helps with food and pain so yeah so that's just my experience with this part like it's really really bomb another thing that I have been noticing about this product since I've been taking it is my skin so I've noticed that my skin has been really clearing up and this is the season like this is the season with my skin kind of excellent and I just noticed like ever since I've been taking it I noticed like my skin slowly is starting to clear up I don't know if it has anything to do with the CD but I've taken CBD products before like the CBD tea that you guys saw me take and one of my old videos and something about my CBD pilots are it's just so bummed because I feel like they help out in so many different ways so I highly recommend any CBD product I highly recommend what it is detox tea but it is by anything that has C meeting in it I highly recommend because I feel like it's just so helpful and it's so beneficial to our bodies okay so like I said I really enjoy taking these this is just like an extra this is like a substitute for when I take my vitamins are definitely too easy every single day I want to take some more right now because they're so yummy that's so good like they taste like real fruit and it is made from real fruit so I highly recommend this product definitely check my description box down below if you guys are interested in purchasing this

the CBD oil whether is for pain for health etc so for those of you that don't know I suffer from epilepsy which is a brain disorder that one side of the brain or depending what part of the brain it throws the wrong electric signals and you could go ahead and think who got to blackout you go to severe seizures and I've been off medication just because I noticed that I was getting more sick with medication so I used to I used I have to admit I used to smoke yes I used to smoke marijuana just because it used to relieve pain and I noticed that it was like slowing down my seizures but then I and the coming up pregnant so you know I stood away from all of that I said you know I'm not gonna take no medication even though doctors was making me try to take medication while I was pregnant so my choice natural and um so long story short I am NOT on medication or anything and I'm kind of feeling better but I'm still I still have the epilepsy it's not like it's gonna go away but like I said so let's go ahead and open this package and let you know the deal tool within this video I purchased it on Groupon because it was $30 but since it was $30 I caught it on a 60% off sale so I got it for 12 not bad night not bad so it's 500 milligrams it's peach flavored gummies that I am the purchasing and it came via FedEx and I'm only for three days to get here so let's go open the package right now actually like this background like it so like I said it's not that I don't I'm not I'm against my iguana because at the end of the a is better than cigarettes or vaping soul but I wanted to try something I was healthier and different especially that I have a child to take care of I don't want out of mothers they'd be like oh you know I get high and I could function right when I used to it used to make me feel relaxed and actually fall asleep or something very sleepy no energy over here I guess we all have different side effects this is okay so this is a little description I'm gonna show you because it has my information on it but is organic CBB gummies from kangaroo CBD 500 milligram peach rabies so yes I will be tasting it with you also remember this is my first time so it comes like this kangaroo cvd 500 milligram I'm sorry about the glazing it comes completely sealed well they look so good - actually these are my favorite yes yes this so I'm coming right now it smells so peach it smells like the candy the ones that we all would usually buy right but you you actually wait get your senses right if you smell the CBD or you in it Oh [Music] so here we go half yellow half peach it smells good so this is my first time trying it here we go Wow he says amazing you could take something with the CBD oil but it takes more of a peach so it's not like tasting on oil and you have enough aftertaste so if it tastes nasty know it tastes is great so right now I've been suffering for the past week a severe lower back pain like I can't stand up and walk or anything so I just took this it's 500 milligrams so I will be seeing and testing it out to see if my pain literally goes away after being like this on an entire week and the entire week so with that being said so worth the $12 especially that day on sale I will be putting the link after this video so you can see that is a 60% off things they have 250 milligrams 500 I believe a hundred a thousand milligrams but I wanted to type try the 500 cuts you know it wasn't my first time trying it but if this works I will continue purchasing it especially to a Groupon since there's always a sale so don't forget to Like

doctor away we're talking about CBD a compound found in cannabis and hemp it's becoming big business expected to get even bigger now that hemp is no longer a Schedule one drug but many want to know if the health benefits are all they are hyped up to be well WEC teas been smart just looked at some powerful stories from an Air Force veteran and business men plus he's also looked at what the research says so been CBD has already been FDA approved to treat seizures what about these other benefits well John the scientific research is slowly catching up with the hype for certain medical conditions what's notable though the success stories from people who say CBD from hemp has helped where other medicines have not so I went into the Air Force when I was 18 Air Force veteran Kristin Thomas joined the military right out of high school but her career in aerospace medicine grounded by disabling migraines they were getting more frequent and I was unable to continue to perform my job reliably and I was medically discharged after ten years it was very sad for me heartbreaking her health battles continued as migraines were joined by night terrors nausea depression and anxiety I've tried over 15 medications I've seen over 10 plus specialists and doctors then this past Thanksgiving nausea forced her to cancel plans with a friend who then forced her to try CBD oil CB d stands for cannabidiol a

mouth and she puts a dropper full of this stuff she's like lift up your tongue just take this under your tongue okay fine so I do that within just five minutes she says her nausea faded away I just didn't feel nauseous anymore after a week of using it when was at my family's house or my husband's family's house I just felt like me again like I was able to smile and hang out with people and I didn't feel like I needed to go lay down high praise for CBD also shared by dr. James Taylor an anesthesiologist currently treating more than 1,000 patients with CBD I'm very excited for the future of this and how it's going to impact medicine dr. Taylor studied CBD with 100 of his patients last year and three things rose to the surface number one was sleep our patients slept so much better the second thing we noticed was a decrease in anxiety the third thing we saw was hope I know that's a little harder for a physician to kind of put a number on on a scale from zero to ten how hopeful are you but what we realized is that patients we're getting kind of a mild antidepressant effect medical research on CBD is still in the early phases one reason the Drug Enforcement Agency only eased restrictions on clinical research in 2015 a scientific review published in 2015 of 49 other studies found CBD has major potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders but longer-term studies are needed other research studies have found potential for treating PTSD social anxiety frequent nightmares insomnia and chronic pain its God Alcoholics Anonymous my family and see the CBD oil that's my life 48 year old Chris Livingston swears by CBD oil for help with his depression anxiety PTSD and ADHD the CVD comes along and has completely changed my life Livingston stresses he's seven years sober and is cautious about taking anything but CBD passes his test and I took it in about five ten minutes later we're talking and we're looking at each other we just stopped talking and I said it's gone and she said what and I said it's gone I feel completely normal it was like the best way I can describe it is a piece just a piece calm today both Livingston and Thomas say they take one dropper of CBD every morning and night at least for these two a dropper a day really does keep the doctor away and dr. Taylor points to a study in 2017 that showed up to 70% of CVD products do not contain what the bottle says he says it's sort of the Wild West and recommends looking for products with third-party testing and of course always talk with your doctor before adding any new supplement or your routine", "wHsPjMwlURw": "cbd gummies here cbd gummies there cbd gummies everywhere all kinds of cbd gummies

nine point eight out of ten try them for yourself guys see if they work for you and thanks for watching guys and god bless", "LM8sid3zFTo": "these are just sugar and citric acid this is test number one didn't want to waste isolate looking good so far", "lGUEWi611Yk": "what is up guys so I actually got two new things that just came in the mail today that I ordered this is the smock novo - and I will shout out my vapor store that's where I get all my vape stuff from it and then we got the next CBD that I've been wanting to try that I've been telling you guys about but we have both of these that I'm going to review I've never had a pod system but this is the brand new pod system that just came out and then the CBD FX stuff I've tried their wax before and a couple other stuff but I haven't tried their vape series yet this was very very highly rated online so I was like you know what I got to try it out this is 500 milligrams I got a coupon code for it so I only paid like think 40 bucks after rush delivery on this not very expensive and they did fill it up to the top and I'm gonna focus on this first give it a nice smell people say you can smell the blue raspberry it smells like some of my pre-workout stuff if this works out well for me I don't know if I told you guys it's not PA has anxiety and depression now on the list for their medical marijuana so that's something I might be trying out nova to novo to pull from the back I was actually genuinely surprised at how tiny the packaging of this is if you guys can compare my hand to it it's very tiny didn't really even hit me how tiny this is going to be I like the portability of a vape also really really love the colors and they look like resin they're not resin every site was saying that they're not resin you look like resin so I got that one it really stood out to me it's one that like really pops it they're really cool I'll post it on the screen here but they look really really awesome you can actually use your nord 1 cartridges in this and vice versa now they did say if you have a nord one you want to upgrade to this anyways because you're getting a lot of benefits plastic pieces each side of the fake resin but it feels almost like you're holding two double-a batteries as a good weight to it I'm gonna try out the mesh pod but they do give you two what you have is this little rubber piece that pops off the juice in and we are gonna try some of this EB D I will tell you guys this now this is very very important let these things lick so let them sit ID to ten minutes okay and the CBD is very clean I'm gonna show you guys it my one true test for a CBD product is how clean it is don't want crystallization I've learned the hard way diamond CBD I would never buy again koi CBD I had a falling off with the company and I'm hearing a lot of bad things with how the company's being rammed everyone thought that now that I had one a bad experience I was [ __ ] on Khloe CBD and will never use it and think it's a terrible product I don't think necessarily and I tried it last it was a horrible product I don't think that then being money-hungry is never a good sign of a company I come from a business background and a lot of people that watch my videos don't even understand that kind of concept and they're starting to take shortcuts when they're trying to cut off all their affiliate and they're saying very sketchy things they're trying to save money in certain spots which never know they could start trying to save money in certain spots with their CBD or easier production of the CBD by cutting corners and you don't want that either CBD FX everyone was like oh yeah they're a ripoff company on the the COI video I made they are actually rated number one online if you look it up and hemp bombs are actually two really good products that people swear by and there's been a lot of people that have liked CBD FX a lot of people that have used CBD FX and vice versa with hemp bombs so I will get hemp bombs next definitely so I'm gonna retake a hit out of this yeah my phone completely died normally it's been dying recently so easy I'm gonna show you guys real quick so there is the LED right there we pointing to it when I hit this vape and you do not want to hit this in a way that you're not doing a mouth too if you're not trying to hit it with a mast along you're going to feel this piece at least in my case get very warm and it's not very pleasurable when it's like up against your lips burning so it's not going to hit like mod in a tank this is up to 25 watts and that's what you want around for CBD anyways but I also wanted something that I can use for CBD and carry this with me if I feel like I need it the LED is a cool thing that they added one issue I have is getting this thing off unless you grab it that's probably the way to go grab it like tightly from the side my hands are so big it slips any other way I am getting them leakage inside this full disclosure but I was kind of confused because when you try to grab it from just the tip it's almost impossible but if you wrap your hand around it the side where you get more of a profile you can pop it off a little bit easier it's in there good so if you're worried about it falling out definitely don't you're worried about taking it out it might be a little bit harder it also had this one sitting for a little bit so we're gonna see how this hits this is a slightly bigger coil inside and it'll be cool to see more coils they invent with these because this is a mesh this says specifically at MTL which is a mouth to lung wear this is a mesh we're gonna try to see if this has a time out and try not to kill myself well for you guys's enjoyment of that 15 seconds of auto timeout it doesn't say that on there but it did fly out for prevent overheating and everything you know for a fact that that's not the type of way that I've ever vaped I don't take huge mouths along it's kind of ironic because you do cough like if you smoke medical marijuana you'll still coffee like you're smoking marijuana in general it feels like I feel lighter I feel kind of lifted as far as the withdrawal symptoms I don't feel them as much I will have to I guess like I said learn to adjust with this as well it's kind of like as needed you can slowly build up and see where you're at it probably depends on your weight your height your like overall size very very well made product it does have a lot of flavor for a CBD oil I will not tell you guys that this is going to taste like an e liquid because some of the e liquids they have nowadays flavor that they replicate is unmatched it honestly sometimes tastes like you're eating the real thing pretty good vapor for this size and like I said it's portability they managed to actually get a flavor into this CBD is one of those things that always has like this this flavor to it and it's not bad the flavor profile of any type of cannabis isn't bad but with CBD in particular it does have this special taste that you know the blue raspberry comes in and it's just hints of it it's just enough to make you forget what you're actually vaping on so when you think about it it honestly kind of blows you away this is back when I was younger and stuff this is what was popular and they still make them there's still semi popular but a tank of the the Box mod down below then you have this mm-hmm alright this has been sitting long enough okay you can even definitely see people said that they like the other one better because it was a warmer taste I'm gonna say I like this one better I'm probably the first person to ever say this what I'm getting with this is more vape production which honestly maybe no one cares about but I still like that especially in this size like I'm actually I'm genuinely impressed with that yeah this is super neat that I can fit this in my hand take this with me on the go it's really convenient really portable I like the LED indicator that they added air flow I didn't try the first one but this airflow is amazing you get super state production out of this with the 1.4 I like that a lot better and it's less hot but I'm also getting more flavor this tastes better this way I can taste more of a blue raspberry with this the bigger one so as far as the the product like I said guys I think this is a go it definitely feels like it works I'm gonna give an update to this video on the road and I'm going to review how well it works for me after a week of using it as like an antidepressant so kind of like antidepressants two antidepressants don't work until you use them for a month and I'm pretty sure I would say a natural remedy like this would kind of work the same way because a lot of people say that I hope this helps guys definitely know what you guys want to see next for the CBD oil and if you guys want to see me review newer vape so let me know down below - I love you guys make sure to be happy stress less I'll see you in the next one as always", "N2NQdUHZHgs": "hi guys and welcome back to my face so this is my reaction to the CBD 75 milligrams gummy bears I bought these from the vape at school today and so

are the others would work shortly once I go home yeah so once again hope these videos are worth the money thank you", "GhBJwctKtTY": "hey guys this is Chris with CBD Informer and today we're going to do a hip bombs review for you and I'm gonna go over some of their products they've actually sent me quite a few of them I've used most of them some of them I don't I don't vape so I didn't use their vaping stuff most are products I've used and so far I'm really enjoying their products so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna put a link directly under this video that'll take you to their site and if there's a coupon code available I want to have that beside of it you can use to get an extra discount on your purchases but they do have some products that I favor more than others and that's what I'm gonna kind of talk about today and his hip balms review and so one of the first products that I tried from them was their max chill their hip balms max chill because one thing that I tend to need in the evenings more than anything else with having four kids and doing home schooling and stuff is being able to relax and just chill in the evening and so this stuff actually works really really well just to kind of calm you down to get you more relaxed and I don't recommend taking this until the evening because it can also make you drowsy and want to go to sleep one of the mistakes I made with their night time gummies is that I thought I would try them in the afternoon because you know with a lot of the previous CBD products that I've tried they didn't have much of an effect but the night time dummies I definitely do not take them in the afternoon because the ingredients in them will kind of really make you drowsy in the afternoon and not want to do much at all but except dragged throughout the day so keep that in mind if you buy any of hemp balms products now they also have a it's a it's called complete relaxation syrup and this is a pretty good-sized bottle now I also have here there's CBD oil and this is 300 milligrams and if I hold them up you can see the size comparison now with the CBD syrup this here has it says servings per container for there's only four servings in this entire bottle so this and it's it has 25 milligrams of CBD per serving so keep that in mind when you take this it is a big bottle it's used for pain and stress relief and help you to relax and sleep a mood enhancer it does taste good it's fruit punch flavored this one here is I'm not sure if they have other flavors but it does taste good but there's only four servings in one bottle this so I recommend if you are looking for a CBD that's really trying to help you with some kind of problem you're facing maybe pain anxiety or something where you're needing a stronger quality type CBD than to go with their oil go with a higher strength of their oil this here's 300 milligrams it may help you but if you're dealing with something pretty severe you may want to really increase that up and go beyond 300 milligrams and if you haven't yet that may be why it's not helping because you need to probably try to get maybe 50 milligrams it up per day I wouldn't go beyond 75 or 100 especially if you're just starting that's actually quite a bit but that's a good place to start if you are suffering from something pretty severe they also have CBD oil for dogs we do have two dogs but I've never tried this it probably a good idea because especially during storms they tend to really get shaky they want to jump on walls knock down stuff and they just they just go crazy during storms but this here is chicken flavored and it says it also helps with joint support natural pain relief and overall wellness they do have beard oil I like it it's pretty good stuff they have CBD vape products CBD vape complete relaxation watermelon I don't vape so I've never tried this but the smell is amazing so if you do vape and if you've tried any of these this one's wild blueberry jam let me know leave a comment underneath about what you thought about those so other people can have an idea they do have a pain freeze it's for sore muscles and joints it smells create like most other of your menthol type creams and lotions and you kind of see inside there it's a it is a cream it's kind of it kind of remind you of hair gels what it reminds you of but it rubs in really nice it doesn't leave a greasy filling or anything and it does seem to help a little bit I have one really bad need that gives me a lot of problems have it completely reconstructed just when I was a little kid and it still gives me problems and I'll use that once in a while one and it does seem to help some there's also a CBD beard balm it does okay I'm not too crazy about the bombs for the beers but if you're in that kind of stuff you may want to look at that and then they also have for tattooing that's called CBD ink aftercare you can put on kind of see with your skin make it a little better other than that couple of the art products I have is the mega dose CBD blend of the capsules so once again I'm going to go back to the point to where if you're suffering from something where you really need a good dosage or quality of CBD go with the CBD oil or go with the CBD capsules because they're gonna provide you with the most and the best relief in my opinion these here says pain relief mood enhancer natural sleep alleviate stress calm relaxation so one to two capsules a day and there are not sure what the dosage is in this 15 milligrams of CBD per one capsules so this one's not very strong here and then CBD gummies these things taste amazing if you've ever taken CBD gummies before I've tried some that are not very good at all if they're just nasty these tastes very good and one gummy there's 15 milligrams of CBD but there's also 2 grams of carbs or 2 grams of sugar so keep that in mind if you're trying to stay away from sugary products that's obviously one reason why these do taste pretty good and the other thing I want to mention is some of him mom's products have extra ingredients in them that you won't find in other products to kind of help intensify their effects for example in the gummies and some of their other products they tend to have what they call passiflora which is a product it's like an herb that really kind of helps to increase the effectiveness of being relaxed kind of in the evening when you just want to just calm down that kind of helps with that overall and you'll find that in their ingredients so as you go through their website that links directly under this video you can go through there and be sure you look at the ingredients because some of those have those in there and they seem to really have a little bit of an extra effect then over the CBD products that don't have those in there so that's my hip balms review I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did visit their website through the link under this video and see if there's any coupon codes down there you guys can use usually they're offering some kind of promotion code or that you can grab and pick up some products and get them a little bit cheaper hope you guys enjoyed this if you did like my video subscribe to my channel playing well putting out more video reviews of CBD companies I have tons and tons of CBD products from many different companies that I've tried over the past couple years and I plan on putting those reviews up here soon so hope you guys enjoyed it have a great day", "G6CeI25ArZI": "hello everyone today I have another CBD video for you guys I went to my local vape shop which I actually haven't visited in like a year because I just haven't been in the area even though they're like 30 blocks away from my house anyway so I bought these two um both brands that I've never seen before so this is called Greg bowls and this one is cannae Green oil this one is 240 mega ooh that's a lot Oh 12 milligrams per piece okay so this is 12 milligrams per piece jolly ranch Jolly Ranchers and this one is 500 milligrams 100 milligrams per piece of sour gummy worm which I'm a little bit concerned about because in the past I didn't I've never like filmed all of my like CBD like eating but I think the highest that I've ever gone for a CBD edible was 25 milligrams so this is a hundred milligrams so I'm kind of scared but at the same time it's just like it's CBD the worst that could happen is I fall asleep for a really long time and then wake up feeling refreshed so basically I'm pretty excited I have really high hopes for this one because they do also make as you can see down here THC candies as well so I think out of the two I'm going to try this one first just because this is 12 milligrams per piece and I have a very important day tomorrow I have a lot of I mean that's not true I have two things to do tomorrow I need to wake up to go to a job interview tomorrow early in the morning and then I have a doctor's appointment after his hat so I want to make sure that I am able to wake up the first doctor's appointment so I'm not about to eat a hundred milligrams of CBD and it's also kind of early now it's 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon so I'm going to take a shower wash my hair so I'm presentable tomorrow because this is like real greasy I'm going to eat some dinner and then or maybe like early or late lunch whatever and then you're gonna try this and I will let you guys know how I feel all righty everyone hair has been washed so has my body I just ate dinner so I am super full um I kind of wanted to wait until I like digested my food a little bit more before eating this because I don't know you know like when you tummy is full of food like it has to digest all the food first before the food like goes places so like things hit you not as fast or as strong when you're like full of food but at this point it doesn't really matter I just want candy there's no pull tab on this one this is by the way again the CC greg goebel's bread good Greg yep yeah chef crafted edibles let me get scissors and open it and down the hatch it'll go hopefully this doesn't taste like trees I don't even know like where to cut this to be honest there's like a little zip [Music] thing but all right we're gonna open this mmm smells good doesn't really smell like Jolly Ranchers it's most kind of more like like gummy candies all right I think they're all kind of uniform in size it looks like they came out of mold so anyone is fun they're like these little like jewel rectangles looks like this I'm excited ready go good okay um dammit why did I buy this with the expectations that were tense and Jolly Ranchers because it doesn't this happened to me another time - when I had like caramel and they didn't taste good either and then last time why I had the gummies in chance good either but at least like with caramels and gummies you didn't shoot them up this is a hard candy and tastes like crap first put in my mouth I tasted like plastic but like not like plastic I wasn't like plastic that taste like nothing had that like chemically like flavor to it like you're not chemically plastics mom and now it's like bitter I kind of like has this weird like it like burns a little bit that house is like gasoline II like taste to it there's a little spice to this I don't know why like I don't know if is like burning or if I said spicy but there's a little like tingly hotness going on on my tongue and down my throat when I swallow I will say the good thing is this is dissolving pretty fast so let me eat the rest of this and wait like an hour and check back hi everyone so it's been about 20 minutes since I ate that jolly rancher that was awful and I do feel a little bit tired but I'm not really exhausted like that time that I had like that ham bomb gummy bear um I will say like I really wish that there were ingredients there was like an ingredients list oh I'm in bed on this Greg apples but there are no ingredients anywhere so I really wish that like Oh God I'm like ruining everything um I wish that they were ingredients so I could see exactly what was in it if there are any like fillers or anything I didn't look at that in this store I just saw the packaging and I was like you Jolly Rancher so um yeah I pretty much wish that I knew exactly what I was ingesting if there are any fillers if there's any melatonin in it or anything um because I'm really not looking for CBD that actually has those fillers and has the melatonin and has you know whatever that makes you like sleepy because that's not really what I'm looking for but I suppose I could look it up on the internet since I'm here editing videos right now in bed so um still feel okay I will check back in another half an hour to see where I am and by the way I don't know if I mentioned this in the video in the beginning of the video but um I am doing this because my ankle still hurts because I'm it's still sprained today is the first day that I decided not to wear the brace and it does hurt a lot a bit from not having the support of the base so that's really what I want to be treating with this right now is this ankle pain that I am feeling so before I start like rambling along because I'm feeling something I'm gonna check back in half an hour all right hello everyone okay final check-in it has been an hour since I consumed the little gem I will say I'm a little bit tired but again I'm not as tired as when I took that hemp mom's gummy bear in a previous video my ankle no longer hurts it hurts like a little bit a little bit but I mean at this point it like doesn't hurt they really doesn't so it pretty much did its jaw and that's all I really asked for so this is pretty much the end of the video I don't know like if this could even be counted as a review but it's a review enough for me because I took it from my ankle and now my ankle doesn't hurt problem solved didn't taste great and although so there's that so until next time I get to try these um thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time bye [Music]", "OtWsP6n3g5E": "[Music]", "0G-n15Av9ag": "how's it going everybody today I want to talk to you about guns we have several

coated sprayed with CVD because then you bite one and a half you're not really getting the true benefits of the CVD so with ours minor 25 milligrams that I personally use I usually tend to use the tinctures but today I've decided to talk about the gummies so I don't need a full 25 milligrams if you saw my tincture video I usually need around 8 to 10 but with the gummies they take a little bit longer to get rolling up to an hour because you are waiting on your body's digestion now I do suggest chew as much as you can with the gummies so that your mucus glands similar to the tinctures can kind of give it a head start so what I do is I take a 25 milligram gummy I happen to have a bottle that's open and what I'll do since they are infused so there's CBD all through in here so the whole gummy is 25 milligrams so if I bite it in half I'm getting about a 12 and a half milligram piece and I find that I need a little bit more CBD with the edibles that I do with the tinctures because remember it's that slow drip into the system you're getting a little bit here your body digests it you give a little bit more and then you get about seven to eight hours which is nice because you get longer than you do with the teachers but you don't get it all in the bloodstream at once and it does like I said it tends to take a little bit longer to go into effect but again with them being infused in vitamin has and now instead of 30 gummies in a bottle of 25 milligram I've got 60 there are 12 and a half piece so a little more bang for your buck rather than buying the 10 milligram companies by themselves so Edna's own bang calm you can find them there if you've any questions call us email us we're on facebook we're on twitter we're on instagram whirling all that good stuff thank you so much and have a great day", "ciMIji2l2GY": "hello everybody in this video is going to be the review that everybody has been waiting for including me it's going to be the world's largest gummy bear review as you can tell from the title it's blue raspberry flavored so let's check out the box first there's all the different products I have will some on them they're amount of gummy bears I really like the back amount of gum beards and the giant one standing in the background beside shows all the flavors if you don't know the flavors it's cherry orange lemon lime sour apple blue raspberry grape pineapple fruity bubblegum Cola and cherry cola I got the blue raspberry right there top has all the flavors stuff like that so let's start the review let's open this bad board okay so for that sorry you guys aren't getting this camera I'll try to get it again first impressions it smells just like the giant gummy snake I had it smells just like that well when you open it kind of smaller than I expected but it's still good I thought it's gonna be like yay high but it's still trying I don't have a gummy bear to compare it to but give it like got like this sorry if I don't get this on camera okay first impressions snow is really strong so really good it sounds just like the giant world's largest gummy snake not not the 26-pound one the one I did a review on so it's just like that that's pretty good open the package you guys did not know I've been excited for this role Oh finally five pounds of dummy goodness right here this is the sexy but here it is it's really thick but the cooling time for this talk forever it looks amazing really dense like dense but let's pan through the part that everybody has been waiting for taste test everybody bites off the ear so why not copy as actually really good that's really good it's actually a lot softer than I thought it would be like it's really soft I did and it's not because it slightly melted outside because I melt protection and it's not hot outside it's like 70 degrees it's really soft that's awesome all the other reviews I've saw like they're struggling just to get a bite but this is actually really soft it's really squishy too it's really good this is really good but I think it would be best ins like small doses like a few bytes here and there like not just to go to town but it's so good it's awesome but as I said it's really really soft and squishy I don't know if it's just the one I got but all the other reviews I've seen they're like one for me it's just really soft but this is actually awesome um curiously awesome okay no um it's really good I would recommend this totally it's a great novelty but it's also a great flavor too bad he can't do like sit ups stood chubby but I would give this ten out of ten it's perfect it's awesome five pounds of gummy it's just the coolest thing ever of course it's actually not as um it's not greasy but not as covered in the stuff they used to take it out of the mold like the lubricant and stuff it's actually not very covered in that stuff so it doesn't get your hands very greasy at all but this is a different review than most people's review on this because there is like it's hard to chew bla bla bla bla it's actually really easy to bite into and - it's awesome thank you guys for watching this can't believe I actually got this and I'll see you guys next time peace out", "ejWo356Cw5I": "yes I'm Mimi and I am here to do a review of cannabidiol life wellness gummies I ordered them for the first time a couple weeks ago and they are spectacular

this as much as as cool as custom grow for 20 was you know hey YouTube YouTube YouTube at all he went out and did sessions in areas that you flied out we're not supposed to be in and he posted those things on his channel I mean the kids smoking the joint standing next to a sign that says private property no trespassing and then they recorded him going past that sign and hanging out on a trestle bridge now not only has he violated trespassing laws but he's also put himself at risk which is one of the things that YouTube has been cracking down on anybody doing outrageous stuff like that they're like no we don't care who you are they're gonna pull you any roads how are you thanks for joining us over there Facebook let well again it depends upon what they're doing what state they're in are they actual true medical patients or are they just individuals that are out here going ahead so they happen to try this and we'll see what it does oh yeah no no I know I know straight central I'm not saying that one oh yeah they they've been they've been cracking down hard on their rules they have absolutely now the other thing is and anybody who's at YouTube knows this YouTube's actually very good Jimmy dad's what's going on buddy man that was a great time yesterday absolutely had a blast at your location thank you very much for welcoming its all into your home yeah man I'm getting close I'm getting close although my sub number and it's weird it keeps fluctuating just a couple days ago it was at 954 or 955 yes Harold I do recall I'm good I'm glad to hear it work for you absolutely absolutely am I happy to hear that word but yeah the numbers here in YouTube as well as like the numbers and Facebook land I truly don't know how accurate they are when we look at of just eyes as a standing because of the way they fluctuate chairs by the way nice fresh cup of coffee but as I was saying know anybody who's in YouTube knows this if you do something if you violate a copyright if there's a not even violating copyright okay if there's a question if there's a problem YouTube sends you a letter they do send you an email now it's entirely up to you if you're gonna read that email and heed what's going on in it or even talk back with them and you don't get a dialogue going and make sure everything is okay so if people don't do that then yeah of course YouTube is just gonna be like well you know we've tried you're not talking back obviously they're gonna yank the channel again I know people that does that that has happened to and they themselves said that when they went and looked at the email account which was associated with their YouTube channel they ended up finding messages from YouTube themselves and like you know Alan there's spam folder or whatever but they did have notice his notification sent to them [Laughter] I mean literally knock on wood in all the years that I have been operating my channel I've never knock on wood never had a strike never had a problem I've never violated any Terms of Service I've never had any issues whatsoever I've been very very meticulous at that even doing what I'm doing now when I do my compound concentrates and coffee programs I make sure the music I play is cleared through YouTube and it's cleared through Facebook so I don't have to worry about getting locked up in jail [Laughter] I'm really curious man a CBD gummy frog now for the ones who don't know I talked about green roads before I have tried some of their products they have assorted different things and when I say they have an assortment they have a lot of products they really do they have everything from a CBD tea that you can drink some edibles to edibles to smoke balls they have shatters they have crumbles they have you know sublinguals that's what the the last piece that I will be testing from them is a sublingual goes under them under the tongue now all of their products - I know some people don't know about it they don't know how it's made they're like I've never heard of it so not a problem I've got you covered [Laughter] that will do that absolutely and I bet you you didn't drink some water before you laid down last night there's a big trick this is one thing man back when I in my days of drinking always always always make sure you have a glass or two of water before you because you will become dehydrated overnight in your sleep now I'll give people the breakdown of how they work their process I'll talk a little bit about this particular product and then I'm going to do my my eating so they're processing it's a five-step process they use certified organic hemp it's cultivated a process according to the highest industry standards it produces the most effective final products and of course they say only to find a stem plants meet their standards grow and without pesticides or GMOs we have broad-spectrum CBD meaning CBD CBG cbn plus terpenes they use a co2 extraction system to extract CBD from the hep plant-based through supercritical co2 now this extraction process takes co2 to a very low temperature under high pressure it gives it properties of both a liquid and a gas now this allows them to extract only the useful cannabidiol out of the plant matter leaving the THC behind once returned to room temperatures all the co2 evaporates leaving behind only the purest isolates now it's completely solvent free although they say it is expensive good morning ed how are you they say even though it is expensive the method is the industry's best practice for solvent free extraction so now they take that CBD isolate and they start out as a crystalline solid the crystalline CBD has been formulated and it's broken down and put into their CBD products its are independently tested so people don't have to worry about that they'll all row components are lab tested throughout the process and the final products are also lab tested for impotency they have over 20 years experience doing what they're doing working with lace and compounding pharmacists who transform their high quality raw materials into their green road finished product so it's there they're not just a fly-by-night company they're not somebody who just started out they have actually been around for a long time whoo yeah no I don't drink at all um I quit in 2010 I was around a bunch of people yesterday that were drinking they were having a good time and that's cool if that's your thing well yeah one of them just talked over at Facebook about how you know the the drink the moonshine that they were drinking kicked their ass all right CBD froggies 100 milligrams their edibles made up of corn syrup citric acid gelatin sugar and then infused with pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol CBD froggies have been infused with 100 milligrams of CBD terpenes are are considered the main building blocks of any plant essential oils and contribute to the set flavors and colors as we all know the blend appears CBD oil and broad-spectrum terpenes is a vegetable glycerin base and causes a powerful entourage effect with a unique floral flavor there see many froggies are made here in America and are developed by licensed pharmacists with again 20 plus years experience the 100 milligram CBD froggies are a low dosage of CBD if you're new to CBD the 100 milligrams CBD froggies are they say perfect choice they do actually have higher dosage now CBD uses CBD has been around for thousands of years by doctors to help in their patients now at the time science behind em couldn't explain why it works but they knew it did however they have their little you know their breakdowns or their products and they talk about how you know their patients believed it to be a very powerful plant with healing abilities even way back way now modern-day science explains the powers of happen why it's used as medicine years ago talking about the hemp plant producing compounds called cannabidiol switch we're all learning about these kendama dials help to create a balance in the cannabinoid system which is another thing they've only recently been discovering that is within all of us which is why you can have four or five individuals hanging around all smoking off a joint of the same product those four or five people can actually describe a different feeling because their body processes in different ways yes we all get that high affect we know that who doesn't love it however your body does take it and put it into this system naturally now they say your endocannabinoid system is out of balance that could lead to symptoms such as inflammation chronic pain headaches other more serious conditions as well and Santino how are you thanks for joining us over there facebook lands nice to see you now these symptoms and conditions come from clinical and academically deficiency which is c e-- c d they even give you a breakdown on the actual ingredients again corn syrup sugar gelatin citric acid natural flavors they even tell you you don't have to eat see red forty yellow 6 yellow five blue one gluten-free andrew Hyginus hemp oil and extract and employ oil now a lot of people ask well how much should i take that really depends upon you your system how your system processes and what you're taking it for so the one hundred milligrams really truly is a good like base all right whoo oh yeah I know smells like candy [Laughter] absolutely that's so funny all right guys and gals take a look at this thing it literally is a frog that's pretty funny well kind of nice pole throw it - I like that oh yeah I like that it's not one of the ones that just falls apart I've had a couple of products before that was just absolutely nasty I have done research on CBD for pets CBD for pets is an absolute amazing thing all right you definitely taste it you definitely know you're eating a medicated product there's no mistaking excuse me not a bad taste I'm not saying that but the initial it's like ooh candy and then you chew and then you're like ooh there's the medication not bad really isn't again nice candy taste definitely a medicated taste no mistaking it green runes now these particular ones you can actually pick up locally a lot of stores carry them however right in Milford right in Milford Connecticut puff City 874 Boston Post Road in Milford go on in and ask for ish if he's there he's the only one of the owners a great person talk to you very knowledgable knows about his products he carries a a decent wine of the green Rhodes products of course as always during my tests I don't play a lot of music but I do play one or two Sarge so mix you up a little something right now since I just ate that product and you know we'll say terrible chat for a few see how I feel dip down into the collection like I did yesterday a lot of people like yesterday's broadcast because it's artists that we've heard from but if all of those were songs that none of us had never heard before again that could depend upon the person it could be anything from within ten minutes - some people say could take up to 40 minutes it really does it's how your body processes things um I myself literally have had feelings for products since I do these tests first thing in the morning my system is nice and clean I have the the effects come on relatively quickly there's a tune from Otis McDonald it's called complicate yet green roads is in fact here in Connecticut that is correct absolutely there were some great bluesy tracks yesterday now dig it down a little deeper into my collections I've explained the people I'll play with people what I mean I get a lot of requests and I heard and I Advent which is why kind of I've had songs that come around that kind of stay of rotation because people like to hear however as it did you know the case of yesterday all right let's go for some of the deeper cuts I've got probably 3,000 or more tracks actually available that I could play both through Facebook and YouTube and be cleared not have to worry about going at Facebook jail or being YouTube strength now Bob Chad you were asking me about how long if you remember when I did the CBD lollipop from this company literally during my test while I was sitting here I even told people I did start to feel the medication within the 20 minute time period 25 minutes website for what I is a lot of websites so you got to be a little more specific all you're talking about for music right here in YouTube as well as Facebook they actually have these audio collections up anybody that has an account has access to these these songs and the artists allow you to not only play the songs actually they encourage you to download I mean they encourage you to use them use them as back tracks and videos use them as an underlying effect use them the way I do yep use them the way I do all right if you're in YouTube you log into your account go into your creator studio when you're in your creator studio on the left hand side there's a list of links you have dashboard video manager livestream community channel analytics so on and so forth well all the way in the bottom you see one that has like a little camera icon next to it and it says create yeah not so good there's that little link and it says create now if you click on that you're gonna see right in there the audio collections you'll find it and Facebook does the same thing I saw also one of the reasons why I've kind of not understood why I know people who have had themselves repeatedly put in facebook jail for finally to copyright music laws and then they go and they do it again so they Facebook violate some another time and then they go and they get locked up in facebook jail and then they get out and then they go and they do it again it's like come on guys really we don't learn now this is why I do it the way I do it I do not have an issue as a matter of fact it helps them out because I'm getting their songs and artists out in front of people who might have never heard before here's blues and abused coming out of are being sold or she were 23 minutes into my test now as everybody knows all my testing videos at the 30 minute mark I shut them down and then I come right back up and I start up compound on straights and coffee for today [Music] No no knocking attempted she it's fixed its thoughts like that to get people put in their facebook jail and YouTube jail or get copyright issues or gets little checks on their accounts I won't do that again in four years that I've been here I've never had an issue I am doing everything I'm doing and building this channel up I'm doing everything I'm doing building I'm compound concentration coffee yeah I'm not going to do stuff to you no risk putting this down and it's all good it's not like you hijacked anything you're asking questions that's what I'm here for [Music] [Music] [Music] and yeah that is one thing I've never liked about a lot of places is people look down their nose at cannabis but individuals who want to sit here and do alcohol and beer reviews you know and drink up oh hey that's cold [Music] [Music] pronounce my name which one are you talking to h7 let's just say my name is pretty simple all right okay I like the products available right here in Connecticut actually available anywhere I mean you can go online you can go to their website you can order that legally and they'll be shipped directly to your door now nice and easy or find yourself a local retailer and support local alright everybody fantastic I'm gonna be out of here Connecticut

real in the mean get to lean in there today on this awesome edition of summer plus one we have again Molly cotton in the house and we also decided we should do a live review of a product we both haven't tried called Charlotte's Web spin that way web anyway today we're gonna be talking about Charlotte's Web we're viewing it together why don't you just give a brief about your CB experience how do you share about it it will be pretty brief I guess I don't have much experience there's obviously like CBD breweries everywhere there's like CBD oil Barney would probably have been wearing live I live in Portland Oregon so she's a hipster yeah so it's everywhere basically and I do like it I feel like THC may not necessarily be for everyone but CBD can be for everyone totally so well this is a show about him we do it all here people done my research here on Charlotte's Web it's seven brothers that came together they were already in the hemp in the hemp industry already further uncle and then wait hold on let me verify they were inspired by a little girl is what they say yeah but that's later that's latter first they were inspired by their uncle and then they were inspired by a little girl and then they were inspired by us alright so in 2008 the seven brothers had an uncle who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and then in 2011 there was a young girl named Charlotte and she had she suffers from a ton of seizures and epilepsy and now she has less seizures mm-hmm so that's the story seven brothers can you imagine popping out seven boys you're like [ __ ] when ye obviously honestly oh we have a ton of something yeah but here's the funny part my mom accidentally named us a bunch of em names except for me and our youngest sibling Lily but not on purpose this woman if she accidentally named six children with a J name and the last one has an a name I mean no I'm no model I do they look the same they literally dress the same in the photos that they upload to the internet like by choice thanks yous they're like let's all wear the same sandals Aggie blue jeans and white t-shirt there and that's our header it's not just also can we mention that's not just on the internet that's their header for their website let them be brothers love the dress alike I mean yeah I guess like don't you want it people are just you like don't hate on people who you know family but it's but we're sisters it's fine it's fine it's fine so you guys are saying that you've never taken a picture with white shirts and sandals with your whole family we didn't occupy Oh stay tuned people hold on I ever verify Wow let me see this I mean honestly though like okay just to defend you you're a kid in this picture cute so these four chrome hasser bowls I know it's charging I'm sorry it's very different moving on let's chat about this one first shall we this is your lemon lime flavor it's calm gonna make a calm let's see what's in it exactly let's read about it throws web comb gum these are packed with lemon balm LC + 9 + x naturally occurring and beneficial Saito can of cannabinoids ingredients quite quite a few tapioca syrup beet sugar from 2 language fella in addition to that there's water natural flavours MCT oil packed in less than 1% Maalik acid spirulina extract sodium citrate dioxide organic lemon juice concentrate citric acid organic sunflower lecithin and tapioca starch what do you this one is recovery its flavor is ginger it has basically what this one is supposed to do what they say is that it relieves joint tension and moderate connective tissue pain resulting from normal exercise and activity so maybe like after the gym or a walk or a paddleboard or an encounter I don't know it sounds like tapioca syrup beet sugar fruit or whatever right that's our water mc2 oil-packed in natural flavors so it kind of sounds like they have like the same like they have the same amount of kind of extract they have the same amount of each tumeric and ginger is what they're saying this this puppy is all about so basically like regardless of which one you take you're going to be getting the same amount of cannabis EVD yeah CBD but there's different additives in each one and that's the difference this one is rather asleep baby tell me how to go to sleep raspberry flavored has melatonin some people love that some people don't I will mention it only has 3 milligrams to gummies every 30 minutes this one is over 30 minutes no no your life I want to sleep forever that's going to bed you said you alarmed calls for the other one because you're so stressed out cuz you're tired should we try it I'm gonna take can I get a spit Cup here we go alright fine I'm gonna try this one first no oh here we go okay I'm trying so that's why with you so we have like honest opinion no it's not it not for me what's wonder do you think that's wrong so we're in same one wait open around oh I'm at red again okay so it definitely tastes like weed heavily there's a lot of weight over time at all yes it does oh it does it definitely basically it really does it taste like raspberry and wheat I taste like raspberry and weed for sure I chewed my [ __ ] up I soaked on it I took a first swim you know not for me personally because what do you think about the consistency good good question well I like here's what I will say about it I don't like when they sugarcoat dummies for cvd I'm not a fan of that so I like it wasn't coded I think that it kind of tastes like one of those like like gummies that are trying to be like organic and healthier so they don't have like that quite right of a chew and they kind of have that like - that's a little bit off I think that's what these shoes are like this does taste like rabbit right it does taste like rye berry that's for sure it's all very taste like snozzberries but also like okay maybe it's just for me who doesn't have like we gummies very often like maybe for you you don't think it tastes like weed because you've had things that do really like weed but just to me I definitely taste the wheat flavor like if you don't have a lot of experience with eating CBD products or hemp products like it tastes like weed it just does beautiful truth time to recover from that one time director so I guess we're gonna take this every time my brother I wonder what the manufacturing process is like a lot of moles of it for me Wow I can [ __ ] anything bad I said about the raspberry Oh Travis that's one thing you said you were like oh I'm gonna be careful not to eat all of these so let's oh wait we didn't even snow hold up first important let me go back to this one smell is it smells a little weird but whatever this one no it does not taste like ginger it tastes like ginger second-cousin removed and kicked out of the state I don't even give it a second drop like a piece of mango and I don't know why like do you get some no little anymore you can't make me that's bar sitting on top Nast alright out of ten gross sorry I mean this is a real reviews from real people sure - I have lemon lime calm let's calm down you know say comes natural I'm gonna throw your zoomer Matthew throw one of mine here we go wash at the same time yeah like what OK ROCK white no I want to say before I start shooting this I want to like this one so I'm gonna hope that I do cuz I don't want to be a hater oh not for me wait again I mean yeah better gummies I have to yeah I've had better gummies in this I'm sorry you know make a web elsewhere you're not gonna catch me player I'm outta here I'm not gonna a ninth-grade hole the first time I ever had weed some guy sold me weed gum and literally all it was is he poked a nug into this piece of gum and I didn't know like what nothing was at the time so I just thought that's what it was truly and I literally gave him $5.00 took a drink passing period and I literally just chewed up this mug that's what it tastes like with dumb in it and like this is straight-up bringing me back to that like literally I'm standing through time not a good one okay you know I don't think that's what their goal was but I felt into that so that is something she's triggered people trigger she's triggered literally the first time like that was crazy and this literally just I forgot about that completely Wow see nice and smells can really do that to my old what would you say your overall review is Molly my guest of all time I mean I like the look of it I like the flavors that they are advertising what I say that's what they actually are flavored like not necessarily absolutely not not close would I say that I like the idea of it yes what I say that I like it again not necessary I would read gift.this 920 21 year 10 milligrams like is that a lot is that a little is very little that's a little it's not a lot so to having two of these that's a little yeah you can probably smash out ten and be fine don't do that so like a person who let's say like has CBD on the regular would they even feel ten milligrams that's a great question Molly that's an absolute great question I pray if I was smashing down CBD on a regular base yes I would 1000% take a few just seven well because for ten milligrams is two of these I took 35 minutes what's up o2 is 10x house are we having me do our own math why I'm not a mathematician tell me how much is in your total most companies do I don't understand why you're not telling me no exactly I don't know if it's full spectrum I don't know if it's broad I don't know if it's isolate give me your stuff what started with the research so like okay so what are we writing some flavor cuz that's not good Jase that's not good if this will get you high don't know cuz I can't figure it out because this is confusing I'm gonna take a recovery cuz I'm kind of getting sick so oh yeah it's just whatever the blend is is there yeah it's the only difference in there anyway I don't I just want to smell a little weird in the ground on you guys no let's smell this it's not what it says it is but I just don't like it tastes very artificial I'm hot gummies that are actually good I know what I'm personally not a fan I'm sorry Mariah sorry disgusting and I think you feel the same way little sister yeah I would say if you're just looking for something that like you are going to want to take every day this may not be it because like what I take this if I need it to sure if you have gag reflexes don't take it I think you do realize the good funny because it's true what's the difference with this CBD versus that like is there different CBDs are these the same CBDs in this one is you know what they're a non although their website is confusing like I just don't like if I were to just or say I like someone who didn't really know exactly what they were wearing where's that where's the third party lab test where is it at I'm I'd like to know is this full spectrum is abroad yeah coming in tonight is someone who doesn't know like a lot about CVD like getting this if I were to just like order a box because I was like referred to it like I would have known I mean I would have no idea what to do this honestly like what I mean what is what what is this really you know if I were to eat one of these it would be for pure medical reasons not because I like the taste you know when you're a kid you're like let me get a vitamin you eat like 17 behind your dad's back that's not happening here you're not eating 17 eggs behind anyone's back I know it's a really popular really popular company yeah and I know that they have a lot of products and they're raved about cuz they're feeling it and they're doing the thing and this is only the first thing I've tried from them personally it's based on taste I'm not feeling the vibe that's me what these gummies that's cuz that's all we've tried so far the gummies are not for us it's not for me yeah for me and like it was just really hard to find any information honestly ladies don't tell me anything nothing and I had to go onto their website to finally find out if they're like full-spectrum or broad spectrum yeah whatever wait what are you and like every finally their website just tells me generally that their stuff is but it specifically say Charlotte's Web produce products are made from high-quality and proprietary strains of whole plant hemp extracts containing a full spectrum of phyto cannabinoids including CBD Charlotte's Web products meet arcs or exceed industry standards for purity and are tested both in-house and by major independent third-party laboratory where I do where show me the facts just say show me the receipts in this way we can create the highest quality products in the industry direct only from family farms in the US now imported hemp or hemp extracts so like a little bit of like this is what we do but like find out well you know what I mean like it's just a lot of research like I just like to like order something and feel confident that they're gonna tell me what's going on and I'm not gonna have to go into like all this research because people want to know what they're putting in their body with you know 100% yeah also they want to taste good I was a little wet down I guess and they got stocks because they got sucks they got revenue growth it up pink oh they got a bankroll but I'm telling you what financial highlights is what they're brought out of right now I would not buy this again I was really hoping I was gonna like this sofa red no thought I was kind of excited I mean it would be cool to do like a more elaborate tastic with a sleep one pop a few like say if they do what they say yeah I would be maybe maybe what I should say I should I should correct my review taste-wise not for me maybe they work though but I spit them out this one just says take two gummies once per day like how long would it take effect how long would it be before the question refer to my other video link in the bio ok if you want to buy this specific gummy package that we bought the variety pack it is on sale for 131 98 original price is 164 97 if you were going to buy them individually they are 50 $4.99 which hit me with some math is about like 91 or 92 cents I got me like a little awesome dollar a gummy they suggest two gummies so that would be about two hours a day yeah which unless you need more which

"Hl-CD06tkms": "Hey guys! Welcome to Remedy Review. My name is Melena, and today we're gonna be reviewing Charlotte's Web CBD oil. In\nthis particular tincture there's 17 milligrams in 1 milliliter so out of 30\nmilliliters in the whole bottle you're getting around 500 milligrams the flavor\nI picked to try out is called lemon twist. Lemons are my favorite fruit which\nmay seem weird but I was really curious to see how this would taste. They also\nhave an orange blossom, a mint chocolate, and an olive oil option depending on\nwhat your flavor preferences are. Yeah, so now without further ado I'm gonna\nactually taste this oil. Oh, it's definitely a little bit darker than\nother oils we've looked at probably because it's full spectrum. Yeah,\nya know that tastes really good it's almost like a lemonade but it's just a\nlittle thicker consistency obviously because it's an oil but no I really like\nthat. It's...I do want to note it's a little bit darker than some of the other\noils that I've tried that could be because of the flavoring which are\nall-natural by the way. When it comes to cost, this particular bottle of CBD oil\nwas $75 which is a little on the higher end for as much CBD that is inside of it\nbut you know you're really getting a quality product from a brand that's been\ndoing this for many years so you can trust anything you're getting\nfrom them. Charlotte's Web is one of the most well known CBD brands on the market\ntoday and for good reason. They're based out of Colorado, and all of the hemp\nplants that are used to make their CBD products are grown within that state as\nwell. They also have very specific lab testing standards and an example is that\nthey have batch specific numbers on all of their products which I tested for\nmyself to see if it worked and it did - and you can just put that into their\nwebsite on their lab testing page and get a specific certificate of analysis\nso you can see exactly how many cannabinoids, terpenes are in this bottle\nso that just gives peace of mind to anyone that wants to buy a product from\nthe brand so they know exactly what they're getting. All in all, I've really enjoyed reviewing\nCharlotte's Web CBD oil I love the flavor of this tincture, and I would love\nto try their other flavors. I also think that anyone that's may be newer to CBD\nand doesn't love the natural flavor of hemp would enjoy these products as well.\nAnd if you're looking for something that's full spectrum, truly high-quality,\nand has a lot of different options to choose from, this is the brand for you.", "vLT8pPAdGC8": "what's going on guys it's your girl izzy brizzy so in this video okay i'm going to be doing a review on a mellow mauve all right so this is a cbd company so if you guys are not really sure what cbd does it's actually coming from the marijuana plant but it does not have any thc so i guess marijuana has like two different chemical compounds cbd and thc thc is the thing that gets you [Music] but cbd is more calming and it reduces anxiety it can reduce joint pains and muscle pains so i have a full collection of mellow mop here and i'm going to be trying some products on camera and yeah let's get into it so first we have the body oil okay this is a body gloss this one of course is relaxing it reduces anxiety as well and it's like a good massage oil so i'm gonna see what this smells like and feels like okay so oh oh and it really smells like a cvd so you know what's crazy i would have loved to have this when i was actually doing hair and i could have massaged my joints with this like every night when i got home from the shop but um it's i guess it's too late for that so so now i will probably use this when i come home from working out and i would just rub this on my knees especially because i have like generational knee issues so i would probably rub this on my knees every single time i work out and before i go to bed to relieve any stress or you know any type of aches and pains this feels really good it's light um i know my hands look like a grease ball right now so you know what let me find some other areas in my body where i can rub this in real quick [Music] all right so it's light but it's moisturizing it feels really good so i'm going to try that for the next like couple weeks so i can tell you guys exactly how it has improved my muscle and my joints and things like that so the body oil is on their website for 39 so if you guys want to go cop that then cop that so next we have the cbd gummies all right so of course this helps with anxiety and reduces stress so these gummies are recommended to take in the daytime because they don't weigh you down at all and remember guys it does not make you high okay it contains no thc so this is perfectly legal number one and it's perfectly safe so let's try one i love gummies oh okay i got two you know what i'll be having extra anxiety so why not just take two hmm so the gummies are good this is the sweet berry flavor and they're like really chewy they're like really chewy uh but that's okay so so you know what i know exactly when i can take these gummies number one before i record my videos because sometimes like you know a lot of my videos are just one take so sometimes i'd be having to like um kind of like low-key meditate a little bit calm my spirit like drink some tea so my mind can like function correctly so i might take one of these before i do my spiritual videos or my astrology videos so i can just be like and i can do my job all right so next we have the cbd oil drops all right these do the same things that the gummies do they reduce stress anxiety and promote calmness so these are actually recommended at night before you go to bed so i'm probably guessing that these are stronger i don't know let's try it okay all right now swallowing oil is not pleasant in any circumstance but it doesn't have a strong flavor so that's good about that and you know what i can actually think of a time where i was taking cbd oil is right after i got my surgery you know i was in like hella pain so i was taking perks and i was taking tylenol and um somebody recommended cbd oil for my pain um that's like a natural alternative so i'm definitely going to be taking this after my workouts and if i ever happen to go to the doctor or have any other painful you know surgeries or whatever then i'm definitely going to keep this in my cabinet all right so last but not least we have the pre-roll-ups okay did i just lick the all right so i was really excited about the roll-ups because i'm like whatever you know so i called the owner and i asked you know are they like what is in it what is in it like it's green is it lit up i don't know so she told me that it's actually it comes from the marijuana plant but it has absolutely no thc so if you you know take a few puffs before work or before any type of maybe stress filled then it's not going to make you high it's just going to relax you let's take a look at these roll-ups okay okay so let's go ahead and use one of these on camera so that was my opening in my review for mellow mauve cbd products which i love a lot and i can't wait to use these products every single day so for the prices the body oil is 39. the gummies are also 39. am i missing something okay the cbd arranges from 59 to 109 but they always have sales on their website so don't worry about that girl and the roll-ups start at 25 so yes quality cbd products make sure you check out mello mauve right now and you know what i might try one of these pre-roll ups off camera you know just just so i can see you know i need to see for myself how good these products are you know so thank you guys so much for watching my channel if you're not subscribed already make sure you go ahead and do that and turn on your notifications check out mello mauve and tell me guys tell me guys tell me how you guys like these products and i'll see you later i'll see y'all later [Music] no", "nzz5J9B1GC8": "hey hey hey good-looking I'm so glad that you came to my kitchen today just sit there and see what we all have cooking well grab ahold and I swing right back to my kitchen and let's get cookin good-lookin today we're gonna take a walk on the wild side and work at a center make our salsa some CBD gummy bears so be sure to follow me and let's get cookin good-lookin did someone say CBD coming bears uh-huh well I sure did follow me and I'm gonna show you just how it's done let's get started good-looking so what you're gonna be needing for your CBD gummy bears is a half a cup of water now I have a half a cup of water here I have myself a container right here and I'm just gonna sit there and dump my half cup of water into my container now let's go on with the rest of the ingredients you're gonna need 1 tablespoon of the Knox gelatin so let's go ahead I'm gonna open this up always always always measure out okay it's not quite a tablespoon so we're gonna have to sit there and get another packet and so I had take that tablespoon of the NOx gelatin and we're gonna sit there and let it soften and bloom for at least a minute or so okay the NOx gelatin has softened and now let's go on with the recipe now you're gonna have to choose a flavor that you're gonna want to make your gummy bears to be but it's gonna have to be some type of a jello you know whatever it you could even make homemade jell of kool-aid packages whatever flavor you want is a flavor that you know we're gonna make we're gonna need 1/3 ounce package of any flavor so I'm choosing to use the tropical fusion this is what yours is gonna look like after we put the jello in and we mix it all up now I'm handing it off to chef Mike and he's just gonna sit there and warm all this up and we'll take it from there but basically you're gonna want everything to be dissolved chef Mike just handed it back off to me and he cooked it for about one minute halfway through we stirred it and now I'm stirring it all again now we need to sit there and let this cool down a little bit you do not want to sit there and add your CBD oil when it is too hot so I always sit there and let this cool down a little bit and then we're gonna sit there and put the CBD oil in it now talking about the CBD oil now they recommend that you sit there and you start out with a low dosage and if you need to have more youth that's when you start working your way up to the higher dosages so this recipe calls for 300 milligrams of CBD oil and also talking about the CBD oil always buy it from somebody that knows what they're doing now I go to registered pharmacist and I bought my CBD oil from him so with that all being said I just wanted to sit there put my little two cents in about the CBD oils I buy mine from a pharmacist all right I brought out my little digital thermometer and I'm just gonna sit there I want to make sure if we're gonna be getting this I want to sit there and see what the temperature of the jello mix is so let's go ahead I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna point it right on in there and it's telling me it's at 111 112 degrees so I'm gonna sit there and add our CBD oil right now to it so I'm gonna measure it out okay and now let's go ahead put it in now you're gonna want to sit there and mix this up really good and keep mixing when you think you mixed it up good enough keep mixing okay I'm quite confident I mix that all up now let's go ahead and talk about what mold you're gonna be using I know I said we're gonna be using the gummy bears so I have a gummy bear mold here and I have it set on the cookie tray that way I can sit there and easily transport these and you can sit there get other ones you know you can get ones for holidays whatnot as long as you have some candy molds basically it's what you need now next thing is you're gonna need some cooking spray now you're gonna want to spray each one of these candy molds all up now when I'm spraying my candy molds I like taking all my things over by my kitchen sink and going like this and spraying because you're always cleaning your sink anyways when you're doing dishes so let's go ahead and I'm gonna go over by my sink and I'm gonna get my candy molds a good spritz okay now that I sprayed my molds all up I'm gonna sit there and grab the gummy bear mixture here I'm gonna give it a final stir before I do place it inside they cut me bear molds gummy bears are on their way baby now I'm gonna go ahead fill my molds up you don't have to thumb up all the way all the cameras right before me - I don't so I'm gonna continue to do this off camera because the cameras really not being useful it's in my way right now so I'm gonna fill up my little gummy bear molds here and we'll be right there okay I have my molds filled up with the tropical fusion gummy bears now I'm gonna make up another package and I'm gonna continue to fill up the rest of my tray here as you see I finished up filling up my gummy bear molds that on your countertop for 30 minutes these sat on the corner for the 30 minutes now I'm gonna sit there and transfer them over to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes and I know I'm gonna get asked why was there more of the purple than the tropical fusion well that's because I used this I buy this old for from the Amish and it was the black cherry gelatin from them and it tells you to use 1/3 cup so I used what my recipe here calls for now that's the one reason why I had more than what I had when I used the tropical fusion okay I brought these out of the refrigerator now time to pop them right out of their molds I'm gonna just remove these and put them off to the side so I can show you what we're going to do so okay I removed one of the gummies go ahead I want you to make all your gummy bears stand to attention just like that so I'm gonna continue I'm molding all my gummy bears and making them all stand to attention just as they are right here and there you go folks that's how easy it is oh I see we got a roll one going again now we're just gonna sit there and leave these that sometimes they don't want to cooperate with you okay fine they don't stay in these on end the ones that aren't standing which I like to call the bad news bears but all the other ones that are standing attention we're gonna sit there and I allow them to sit like this for two days now this is gonna sit there and let them toughen up and dehydrate a little bit more and become more of them little Hasbro gummy bears that y'all no one loves so much but there's one further step that we have to sit there but they're one another one that we have to sit there and take this one more step further after this stage so like this for two days come on load guy you guys get with the program now stand up student you I'll see you in two days two days have gone by now what you're gonna want to do to the ones that are standing up is let me sit there and zoom down a little bit such as this one here you're gonna want to sit there and take it and just lay that little guy down like I have all these other gummy bears now we're gonna let them sit like this for one more day then they should be like them Hasbro gold gummy bears that we all love and behold so dear to us these should be just like them they should be you know that that should have that tackiness that the Hasbro gummy bears have you know I mean they're perfectly fine if you want to sit there and eat them this way go for it you can but if you want it to be more like the Hasbro gold gummy bears you're gonna want to sit there and do this extra step now folks I just want to sit there and put out a kindly reminder please keep these up out of reach of young little children remember this is a medicine and we should treat it as a medicine now if you'd like to just saw in here today please

continue our special three-part series on the launch of our cbd gummies across our hemp ons and nature script product lines our wholesale and retail partners can take advantage of more sell-through and more education with our new acrylics and customers will notice a new look to the brands that they have come to trust for cbd products in the retail industry this is the cbd university podcast and it starts right now [Music] i'm joe agustinelli the host of the cbd university podcast if you are a returning listener thanks for tuning in once again if you are a new listener we are glad you found us on your podcast platform of choice you can also see full video episodes of our podcasts here on the global widget youtube channel if you are watching or the youtube channels of our brands this is episode number 30. it's hard to believe more than 13 000 downloads as we approach 15 000 since our launch in november and our year of more as you can see the new poster depending on the angle you'll see it shortly uh depending on if you're watching on the youtube channel on the on the angle once we talk to vince our year or more has turned into our summer of more part two of our three-part podcast series looking at the launch of our cbd gummies which we launched a couple of weeks ago from hemp bombs and nature's script we'll literally discuss the new look of packaging that customers will be seeing in retail locations and our amazing in-house graphic design team and i just talked about that new poster you'll see shortly and some fancy look new looking displays that you'll begin seeing rolled out across the more than 25 000 retail locations our products are located in nationwide to help me go through all that and the guy who makes sure that all those customers are happy and does a fantastic job doing it our vice president of sales ben skilling vince welcome back to the podcast all dressed up for episode number 30 i should have worn my tie just for you joe thanks for having me no thank you um all right so let's just start right away let's start off with the with the look we have new displays for our distribution and retail partners and what went into the thinking of the new displays and how do these new acrylics or displays uh lead to more sell through for our retail partners well what we tried to do was really uh make something that that that maximized uh you know the visibility of the products being cbd in the store so um you know we added a topper to it now that that says cbd sold here uh matches both you know hemp bums or or nature's script and the perfect pause brand but i again i think um when you look at the displays we took a lot of feedback we got from from retailers and our distributors and i think they look amazing you know i um when you walk into a store there's absolutely no way you can't not see that display if it's put in the right spot so we're really excited about that we also added the price points um and being that we did just increase the milligrams on on the gummies and some of the other products like the tinctures we also wanted to call that out as well so uh we're really really happy with the way they look yeah a lot of the um familiar products that you will see at retail locations and and i alluded it to it in the uh introduction but the the whole year of more um so a long way and the gummies is just the latest ones we'll get back to the gummies uh but let's just review a couple points you just mentioned uh the oils were updated in may yep um the pain freeze uh prior to that with uh more cbd the one ounce container now has a hundred milligrams the four ounce has uh 400 milligrams right then there's a high potency version which is a thousand which is a thousand and then the pain freeze now also comes in a roll-on application that's got 200 milligrams per bottle correct and now the oils range from 300 milligrams to 5000 milligrams all without raising the uh the retail srp yep correct so um you know the cost of raw materials particularly when it comes to cbd has come down uh with us having our extraction equipment in place now we wanted to you know take that uh savings and pass it on to the to the retailers and then you know to their customers so uh it's definitely a win-win for us i think we're def um ahead of you know where some of the other brands are in the market so we're really excited about it i think you know you're going to start seeing probably other you know brands start to do that but for now you know going from you know on the gummies or let's just say the tincture since that's what we're talking about it was a 300 mg for 39.99 retail and now it's 19.99 so literally in half which is great because a lot of people want to try you know a little bit higher dosing and get you know they get just more value and speaking of more value going back uh now to the gummies along with the displays we've also redesigned the look of the packages and the bottles and i do invite you to tune in to our youtube channels i mentioned on the introduction for some video extras to this podcast episode as we will be showing off the bottles and we've got a few here in our in-house podcast studio uh retailers and customers will notice that not only is the display catching but i tell you what the new look nice great nice work really jumps out at you yeah so we wanted to try to do it just make it very clean um but also uh to make there sure there's a huge difference between the original formula the sleep formula and you have the high potency so i you know with hemp bombs we did green blue and then red so it looks really good on a shelf um these are the bottles here but you know a lot of the new displays we have going out are going to have the bags um so also the having the call out on the milligrams you know being a lot bigger um making sure it says cbd you know one thing we did with uh nature script is that we made it so the packaging actually says cbd on it instead of hemp extract you know so i think from a marketing standpoint and just um for that brand in general i think sales are increased alone just with that on the gummy so we're definitely pumped about it and then um no matter the brand one thing that has not changed is the transparency that is on uh our labels on both both the hemp pumps and the nature script brand obviously all your on the back all your nutrition facts ingredients and still those uh scannable qr codes uh also uh the the uh you know keeping in touch with us on social media facebook twitter uh instagram and youtube just a just a cheap plug there um but uh qr codes and the qr code still as you can scan them one will take to uh the lab testing and compliance and the other will take to uh will take the customer or even a retailer for that matter to learn cbd and we talk about more education especially with our retail and distribution partners so what additional educational resources do we have when it comes to our products so yeah the the qr codes are huge on the packaging just from a compliance standpoint in general um but we act we're getting ready to do our second uh cbd newsletter as well the market trends so which that that's pretty big for us you know over the last few years i definitely consider us thought leaders in the space and it's a great way for um you know retailers and distributors to get information on what's going on in the industry you know how to stay ahead with trends what we're doing internally what's happening with rules regulations on a state level federal level et cetera and the second issue that retail trends recently came out you can find the link on no pun intended our linkedin page but also on our global widget partners website and that just a reminder to retailers and wholesalers to follow us on our linkedin channel for the latest news and information and educational resources uh that are available in addition to the educational resources we talked about the newsletter and obviously we've had the cbd university uh we have the podcast here in addition to the educational resources what are some of the you know we talked about the design and the new law what are some of the marketing resource materials in addition to the displays that are available for retailers and wholesalers to ensure sell through right so uh i would say the the key really now is is is foot traffic and generating foot traffic in in stores um and cbd is one way to do that and you look at you know what's going on with covid and certain business having to to shut down or maybe have different hours um you know it's you want to take advantage of every possible chance to bring somebody into your store whether they buy cbd or not by using things like the the yard signs window clings uh trifolds you know there's a lot of resources like that just to bring attention and brand awareness to what you're carrying in your store you know really looking at cbd and treating it like every other category um in your store not just having generic signage um it's it's very important so people you know as they become more educated i think quite frankly a lot of people are educated especially to the hemp bombs and nature script brands they recognize that as quality products that some of them may have had or they know people would try so instead of just really advertising generic generically we've been really trying to push you know the retailers to use the stuff that we have that's branded signage whether we have to make it for them to um that's really just going to help them increase sell through and get foot traffic into the stores and when we talk about the uh new gummies and a lot of our new products on the gummy side we're talking more gummies per package now at the same price it was prior and more gummies per bottles we didn't i know we showed them off what we did so the package what used to be a five pack is now yeah it's eight yeah so that's an eight count so um we kind of got side tracks we'll go back to that because it is really important so the the five count uh is now an eight count and a 75 mg's that was 9.99 retail is now 120 milligrams so 15 mgs per per gummy uh same retail um so what else is unique though is we added a sleep and a high potency formula in a larger bag so the one that we had was 12 count original is now a 20 count and that retail was 19.99 so you're getting almost double the amount of gummies for the same retail price point but since that was such a huge hit we we did add the sleep gummies in a 20 count as well as uh the high potency in a 20 count which the high potency retails for for 29.99 it's 600 mg so um really really good pricing when you look at what's in the market and what people are looking for in terms of uh you know those impulse items like like gummies in the bags on the bottles themselves we increased from a 25 to a 50 count and from a 70 count to 100 counts so you know a huge increase there as well so again it goes back to more value more milligrams of cbd per unit um but also you know the stores now are going to have a big advantage you know if you're carrying our brands and people know that you know what to look for it's going to definitely increase revenue and sales for for individual locations and if anybody has retailers or wholesalers have any uh questions or additional information feel free to reach out to our team and we'll certainly uh be able to help you out in any of the marketing and educational resources that we discussed on this uh episode so a year or more oils pain freeze gummies yup what's next i dare you are you are you asking me foreshadowing until next time yeah so you know look for more obviously coming coming soon yeah i know we do we have a lot of other products we're working on and we're really excited about but the key really is just we're the as we develop new products we've had a lot in in r d and um a lot of our products come from the feedback we get from you know retailers and distributors like they tell us what people are asking for so that way when we come to market with the new product chances are it's going to really sell well because we're not just making stuff and trying to put it out there so um but yeah we're always working on stuff the topicals and um i'm sure there's gonna be continue to add new new products and things like that as well even to the to the pet line so yeah and again that's uh so we're talking the new gummies on our hemp bombs and our nature script lines and we'll certainly have more information on more new products on all three of our product lines coming coming soon so don't forget to subscribe to our cbd university podcast on your favorite podcast platform of choice and you can get notifications when

also have to face the fire of four other dragons [Music] hello dragons my name is Michael Tkach and I'm Tim in skip and we're from Caron UK we're asking for an investment of fifty thousand pounds for 15% of our business we have the UK rights to the current portfolio products which are all made from cannabis sativa plant extract make how would you like to explain your story I am from the Czech Republic and I was working in the UK when industrial accident changed my life I damaged my arm and I lost several fingers on my hand amazing an injured surgeons transferred a tow from my foot to my hand during that times the pain was unbearable and the scarring was extensive visiting Frank from the Czech Republic brought me the car own appointment and another hemp products I started using them and their results was incredible so I like to share this experience with others and I approached current Czech Republic and brought these products to UK so we have 18 different products ranging from face cream shower gel hemp leaf tea and hemp seeds and they're all made from cannabis sativa commonly known as hemp we are vegan organic and totally legal as the products contain none of these psychoactive elements found in in cannabis but they're very high in the other elements known as cannabinoids which are currently proven to be beneficial in treating many different complaints we're passionate about cannabis sativa but we are plainly retail amateurs and we need the help of a dragon to guide us to manage our growth and fulfill our full potential thank you very much for your attention and we have some samples if you'd like to show what possible that we have the samples at the end is because I'm slightly worried if I have to take any of the samples I might make a wrong investment decision they have no suckers apical affect whatsoever yeah now they've reassured the dragons the products aren't mind-altering Tim inskipp and me Celtic arch can get on with the business of handing them out there looking for 50,000 pounds for 15% of their business selling cosmetics made with a cannabis extract but Pizza Jones is still confused about the legalities of the operation how can you convince me that this isn't a potential front for a big drug ring we have the we have EU sensitive all youth certification all the farmers are certified there's very strict law oversee these farmers what's stopping the company in Czech Republic the temptation to realize that they make a small amount of money on this but the real business behind the scenes is cannabis they grow into different blind entirely and it's it is illegal to grow different plants what Moe would make it restricted is the level of THC which is the psychoactive component of the hemp plant which it doesn't have so essentially it's legal it's not a restricted substance okay so I'm not gonna be an investor in some sort of illegal drug no absolutely not because of you're gonna go to our butter and you've given three different creams here the ones are bomb as let's bomb yeah and then these are its anointment is it all the same product sit no okay is this a cosmetic is it a medicine at the moment we marketed as the cosmetics we don't make her claims it helps people and we sell it out isn't that a major problem because a you can't tell anyone what the product does you just said it's an all-purpose hemp pointment I don't know if it's to moisturize and make my skin glow I don't know if wish to reduce pain for you know joint pain or injuries I've got this does have medical device certification in the EU in Czech Republic they have run the trials we are talking specifically about this product to get a medical device in the okay the point is that the evidence is that it does help in a very very wide range of different complaints and problems but we cannot say that we are going to cure any of this but you definitely can't say they don't have a medicines license to say that but what I'm saying is that you don't know what the products for who owns the company Karen know my friends in the Czech Republic your friends yes how much of the company do you own none none we'll check it probably nothing nothing basically our relationship is that macao developed some of the products in the Czech Republic brought them over to the UK and tell me what's your deal with this company they are my close friends so you've got to buy from them yes is there a minimum quantity of to buy no and your license with them is lost for how long - 2023 at the moment and can they terminate your contract early turn up now can I look at that agreement yes yes Tim what's your role in this business are you are you an equal share holder no I'm a minor shoulder at the moment the shareholders split how I only have 10% yeah I got a 90 and 10 I got a 60% of the company and we got another of my no shareholders which helped me on the beginning will be the start of the company and how much would they put in to help you from the beginning there was no more than 20,000 altogether I invest my owner over nearly 200,000 in in the business two hundred thousand pounds and what who's where has that been spent unwisely I did a lot of mistakes on the beginning I hired Ireland the warehouse ten and half thousand thousand square feet much big offices and hired people because I believe because I were watching the Dragons Den I want to do big it's all fall then there's Peters fault specifically no launching is for the SETI's well this is my time thank you so it's Peters that fall so he's not your favorite dragon that's good to hear so you made some mistakes in the beginning so how much would you write off of the 200,000 as a mistake [Music] a hundred thousand for sure right now you have absolutely no negotiating tools in here whatsoever on June the 3rd 2023 if you've done a cracking job you hand this business back to these guys there's nothing in here that gives you an automatic right of renewal from my point of view they will be only against themselves how they can do it without us after years well because you built their brand they've got a really really valuable asset over here why on earth were they renew mm-hmm job done market penetrated I'm not spending my time building somebody else's brand for them they won't be investing I'm out a lack of control over the future of the business has spooked Deborah Medan and it's left to KO suleiman wondering how an investor would get their money back my question mark here is the fact that you don't own the brand it's a distribution and there could be no exits yes well we believe at the moment the exit is to sell back to Karen check have you got agreement to that we are negotiate that agreement so you haven't got any grieve now look I'm not doubting the product amazing product as you say but you don't own the brand once you've created the brand the retail is what the brand I don't care about you I do wish you all the best because you're gonna make your friend rich I'm out okay touka Suleiman joined Deborah Medan in exiting over that controversial distribution contract antes Levani has some words of wisdom on the pair's plans to back up the potential benefits of the product products like this the most important thing is to show the effectiveness that it works you will need to do clinical trials and pretty much every region or territory that you launch it because it will have different licensing agencies and the cost of doing a clinical trial do you know much that costs in the UK to do a clinical trial like this about a hundred twenty thousand exactly to get them licensed will cost you a hell of a lot more you're gonna have to raise half a million pounds I'm at okay thank you okay thank you Michele Tim I'm concerned about the way that you've gone about setting this business up the hill particularly you where you've having friendships and in your home country is fantastic but what you should have done was if you had such a huge amount of money two hundred thousand pounds to invest you should have found a way to invest in the holding company in the Czech Republic I could have been potentially interested actually in something like this but ultimately you've brought a distribution agency style deal that I think isn't good enough so I'm out okay thank you Peter Jones's departure leaves Jenny Campbell as the last dragon standing is she able to see the potential for profit in a business her fellow millionaires have shunned so I mean this is a bit of a mess isn't it from where we're standing I'm sure you can see that you come into the den with a an exclusivity agreement you're halfway through and all sorts of issues on extending or minimum purchase levels how confident are you that you can renegotiate that exclusivity agreement on the book Alfie on a hundred percent confident okay so I think this is complex but I can see the belief in your eyes Mikkel and certainly you've come onboard to him with the same belief but I will make you an offer so I will offer you all of the money but because of the risk factors multiple risk factors in this deal I would want 25% of your business the garage for offer can we have a little discussion please go talk to the wall an eleventh-hour change of Fortune as Jenny Campbell backs her gut instinct with an offer but at 10% more than the entrepreneurs were offering they have a tricky decision on their hands thank you - for your offer be able to accept the offer [Applause] welcome to the cosmetic duo have given up a quarter of the company but leave the den with a 50,000 pound investment that's what we lost it I did say you shouldn't use their product before I can't wait to have a fancy yeah you'd like to meet Jenny as silly as possible it's pre share our excitement and our visions and maybe have a bottle of champagne yeah you", "a_RxK4BcgGI": "[Applause] [Music] you [Music] Oh", "Wdl-JfFJP0k": "[Music] today we have an

cbd hemp library with yet another delta eight thc edible review yeah like we told you guys we're always excited to present all the options to you guys it's not just ours not just our favorite companies not just texas companies it's really all companies all options that we can find we love to present to you guys so we're definitely excited about this episode and i personally love delta eight edibles so i'm always excited to add a new one to the repertoire [Music] and on today's episode we have some serene tree provided green apple delta 8 thc green apple is just the flavor i have we actually have three flavors and these are all in the ring style like the peach rings and candy rings yeah that's what it is and each of them is 25 milligrams and there's 12 per pack and i think it's from the company bottle and tree but it's provided by serenetree.com and you said you have the apple green apple yeah i have the peach rings and then i also have the blue raspberry so we're gonna give all three a try so in total we're gonna be eating 75 milligrams today so we'll be able to give a pretty a pretty accurate test you know and we'll also be able to give a very accurate taste test of the taste so yeah exactly so what we're going to do is try all three of them give a little taste breakdown see what we're thinking maybe label which which one taste-wise is our favorite then we're gonna take an hour break we're gonna set the timer on we're gonna play some video games and then come back and uh give our effects review so oh yeah so i'm gonna start with blue raspberry as you can see it's just the typical ring shape and we messed this up before and we've eaten these edibles before yeah and so sergio i'm gonna steal a line he said in the last episode but like they're perfect to be able to bite in half um because of the way they're even set up and the size of them all that stuff it's perfect to be able to bite in half if somebody just wants on that 12 and a half to 13 milligrams they don't want to eat the whole 25. yep exactly and i'm starting with the green apple same setup just green and white color and i will say they smell delicious i don't know if that matters much but they do that matters to me a lot when i'm eating something that's true i think all humans do naturally though to like that's kind of like a part of our evolution if it opened up and smelled like [ __ ] i don't think it would taste good yeah exactly we assume we're not supposed to eat it all right that blue raspberry was pretty good it's pretty on point to flavor um yeah on the next one i'ma go apple green apple next the green apple has like the perfect amount of sourness to it that it hides the taste of the oil very well i get barely any hint of it whatsoever the texture is perfect the amount of sugar on there is perfect as well so very well executed uh edible overall now i'm gonna go into the the blue raspberry i'm gonna agree with you yeah that green apple that amount of sour definitely gets away all delta eight distillate taste um that might be in there that isn't a lot of edibles and for the size of the edible for you to not taste any oil in there it's definitely an upside yeah see already with the blue raspberry delicious texture delicious taste as well but i do get a little more of the oil i got you and last i'm gonna go with the candy that i actually really like personally all the time or like regardless of whether it's in a delta eight form or not last number of the peach pass them on over i've had a few of these before and the peach rings are always fire the peach rings taste pretty true to name it tastes like actual peach rings maybe that hint of oil that you want in there to prove that it's an edible but overall i would actually be pretty confident giving this to somebody and them not even being able to realize it's edible they might be to realize a little bit something's different about it but not really that like it's a a marijuana edible or a delta eighties edible or whatever you're not saying you should serve these at your local uh family gatherings i think that's illegal but yeah definitely keep away from the kids and also guys we would not really suggest 75 for someone who's getting into starting it we meet so many people or so many people dm us telling us like you're the reason we started delta hey like delta 8 we found it because of you guys and we are very appreciative appreciative and like that fact or love that fact but at the same time don't always necessarily replicate what we do because we do eat a lot of delta 8 thc edibles and i would hate anybody to be overwhelmed because you go out and you eat 75 milligrams off of it i completely agree it's always a good i always start slow and then go if you're an experienced thc person maybe start with 125 milligram if you're not experienced with thc at all tread very lightly yeah i would say eat half of one yeah because there are some people that do get that overwhelming feeling we're not going to sit here and just try to trick people absolutely and i will say all three flavors all three textures the amount of sugar that's on each one is absolutely perfect they're really really well done edibles i mean down to the texture the taste i mean there's really no complaints and um i guess i'll go list my top three for now do you wanna okay yeah we're not gonna give her a taste grade really overall it's kind of for me just a stamp of approval for all three depending it's subjective to what flavor you want but yeah go ahead if you like green apple if you like blue raspberry if you like featuring all three are executed to damn near perfection when it comes to these edibles so definitely check these out especially if you're looking for something 25 milligrams and with a unique little cool bottle just a little add on there yeah so my favorite my top three would be i'll start with number three my number three is blue raspberry my number two but just barely is going to be the peach rings and then number one is going to be the green apple for me but between the peach rings and the green apple it is very much a toss up it's also dependent on what i'm in the mood to eat but i do like how the green apple with the sour taste adds the uh the high the heightness the hidden oil is uh perfect for me and uh yeah so we got green apple number one petrings number two and uh blue raspberry number three for me my number three is going to be the green apple and that's typically just because green apple isn't really my preferred taste in general i don't really like green apples themselves but at the same time i respect that taste like sergio said it's the perfect amount of sour that allows the edible to cover up that kind of distillate taste or whatever um and second for me is going to be the blue raspberry and then first it's going to be the peach ring the peach ring is the classic candy and i i mean i really enjoy it we've been moving through these some we definitely taste test and then ate a couple extra um and now i think we're gonna take this break um to actually chill and see how the 75 milligrams kicks in we'll be right back a telltale sign of edibles working especially the delta eight edibles as we talked about before is the cottonmouth and i'm starting to get some of that cottonmouth i agree so it's been about an hour and five minutes since we ate 75. 75 milligrams of the serene tree edibles uh we had the blue raspberry green apple and peach rings all flame as you saw a couple seconds ago yeah but um you know i definitely am getting the cottonmouth it's creeping around the corner i could feel it i would say the heaviness in the eyes i'm feeling and since we stopped focusing on the video game i'm starting to feel it a little bit more it's like it's like the blood is rushing to everywhere that's not my eyeballs you know what i'm saying because i've been so hard focused for damn near hours straight on these video games yeah so that's what we do in between we go an hour straight on the games two minute sessions so we did about 30 of them hell yeah and in the course of the hour so yeah i'm crushing that and you are right now that i've refocused into you know just day to day it's talking yeah definitely i feel it a lot more yeah feels great i would say it's still the same delta eight experience that everybody would hope to get that i feel very lifted i'm in a great mood [ __ ] i can honestly feel the giggles even maybe creeping along a bit and it's not overwhelming by the slightest we were still able to shred on the [ __ ] tony hawk like 75 milligrams is a nice that's a nice amount it's this honestly would be a lot for somebody this is not what i would suggest if this is your first time getting into i'm delta eight edibles but these serene tree edibles they're nice the taste it's like normal candy and i'm starting to really feel the effects we didn't give an overall taste grade um but we gave our stamp of approval simply because there's three different flavors and and they're all in that elite category it's really subjective in my opinion at that point yeah exactly they're all elite flavors or elite done as well and if what's good about the ring style edibles if you are new to them it's very easy to eat half yeah you just eat it right in half and if you haven't ever eaten delta 8 or delta 9 edibles or you're not a thc person in general yeah definitely don't go three deep in order yeah just not a good idea yeah so we have tolerances you know we i do this i eat edibles damn near daily so but still good that we feel them exactly like even with the tolerance guys we literally professionally consume delta eight and cbd essentially so even with the tolerance that we have i still feel great right now and i hadn't smoked for a while before this video um so i had a fresh reset if you will and and having me feel great yeah i feel great as well i mean it seems like serene tree here is on to an elite product overall definitely the effects are noticeable they're exactly where you'd want them to be for delta eight for me you know it's that it's the uplifting energetic but it feels good it's it's kind of like a hybrid sativa but nowhere near overboard it's like you get the energy push i get the it's almost weird because you get the the lowerness of the eyes the overall feeling of relaxation but also like a mental energetic boost a little bit in a way maybe it's also because we we're just button mashing our lives but there is that bit of clarity yeah you've talked about that with yote edibles before of all the brands you've talked about there's there's that definitely lift in there but at the same time there's that clarity to where you can continue to do what you need to do we focus on the video games um i feel like i can edit after this work on the website some so guys um with the serene tree or with delta in general like sergio was saying there's that bit of clarity in there until you get to a certain level once you get to a certain milligram then it might be a little bit unclear what you're doing but we've actually had people tell us that they had animals blast them into the past oh yeah we did say somebody time traveled on them yeah these might enter you into the hot tub time machine no guarantees we are not doctors or not time machine creators yet but um we are very impressed by these edibles safe to say i mean i didn't know what to expect they are elite tasting i mean the effects are exactly where you would want them to be definitely perfect in the effects i mean what are you thinking for i guess we could go effects and then overall grade right um i guess effects grade maybe it i was thinking just because the amount different is sorry i'm starting to zone out because these edibles but the 75 milligrams isn't consistent with all the other ones but i would say 475 milligrams i feel great me too um and they're candies that i can eat also which is nice there's nothing i had to struggle through so i guess overall for effects i'll give that 9 9.25 it's what i would expect from 25 milligram delta eight which is again is why we've said we like delta 8 a lot because of the consistent dosages like i i know what to expect from a 25 milligram high of delta eight as well as 50 and 75 so that's great and um yeah so 99.25 yeah i'm going to go with a 9.25 as well they are elite all the way through i mean i'll just 9.25 for all the men reasons you mentioned you know the relaxation the clarity the overall greatness of this substance we call delta eight right and that leads me into my overall grade which would be an a there's no point of docking it too much for me it's it's exactly where you'd want it to be the flavors are all on point yeah i will mention again my favorite flavor was a green apple then peach ring and then blue raspberry but they're all in that elite tier texture perfect taste perfect effects perfect overall very well done serene treat and check that out i'm peach then blueberry then green apple but i'm also going to give that a there's no reason to dock it these are elite at that 25 milligram point which is perfect for people to try if this is your first time looking for delta eight um so yeah it's a it's a very good product i can't really say anything else about it this is an ideal like get in a petring bag and take it on the plane with me eat some right before i get in the airport or something and eat it and just relax it's like perfect for them yeah and i've also found just completely random side note at the very tail end of a video flying with delta eight and eating it while like on the flight is absolutely perfect it's nice yeah it's because i've had bad experiences with delta nine so i'll add that in there yeah we're still here to hear that little tidbit make sure to hit that subscribe hit that subscribe button hit that like button comment share

packed it's really smooth it does kind of burn easy just right now i did about half the bowl dang plain jane [ __ ] out there themselves i'm gonna go over one more time the products so we have the blunt um the twax keith blunt which you know sometimes when you order pre-rolls sometimes they're a little bit harder to smoke out of than other ones i already know anytime you get a pre-roll it's gonna be a hit or miss so blunt was okay it was kind of decent this smells absolutely amazing and it's not oily which is or not oily it's not greasy which is always a good good good sign it smells super [ __ ] good one of my roommates is actually having back pain so i'm very interested to see how this would work on her because i currently don't have any pain so but um as far as like smell and like moisturization and the feel of it i definitely would recommend getting this um it smells [ __ ] amazing i would give that as like a christmas present honestly then there's the hem flour the hemp flour is pretty good it smells good it's fresh um it's properly packaged the packaging is pretty cute i like it i'm feeling pretty zen because i'm not gonna lie before before i started filming this

so today we're going to try the chill gummies they say they're 100% CBD infused I've never tried to see edible so we will see how this goes and how they taste suggested use is consumed no more and two pieces every six hours first time I've ever seen a don't use too much but we will see how this goes also says do not use in conjunction with alcohol energy drinks or herbal or natural supplements so very curious to see what this is gonna be like 'hot as soon as you open the bag it smells just like coming here and it tastes just like a donger literally just like one which is very good it's like I just ate much how are you doing there we will see how it goes up to you it's been about 30 minutes since taking the chill gummy I only took one it said you could take 1 to 2 but I only took one since I am very fatigued definitely felt a quicker more intense chill than my vaping they were very flavorful so it tastes amazing I saw somewhere on one of the websites that each gummy is about 20 milligrams I don't know how accurate that is but [Music] definitely felt the chill effect a lot more than when I vape all day pretty much and get a lesser amount of milligrams so definitely recommend so pros on the chill gummy bears they taste delicious and they definitely have a relaxing effect cons you can only take two every six hours which is a little weird to me don't have much information on the actual packaging and they are pretty pricey they were about twenty dollars for about seven or eight of them so it's definitely something to think about I gave one to my husband as well said he definitely did feel an affect of it a calming effect he's obviously much bigger than I am so they definitely do work I'm just not sure of the purity of it and its really the financial aspect as far as if it's worth getting them when there's such a small pack for the amount that they are so definitely something to think about but what I recommend them sure if you're into edibles they definitely do taste delicious so definitely worth giving a try and we will go from there and hopefully you look at my videos and check out my next review [Music]", "PkTQ8d87LEk": "[Music]", "-oGhDEqEaTE": "good night good night good night so 10 o'clock tonight sunday night just want to leave a real quick funny story happened to me last week real quick so for those who know me knows that i had surgery last week and i was in quite a bit of pain for about i don't know a week and a half or so today is one of my best days so far so last week i was pretty miserable and i was like i didn't take any pain pills because i i don't do good with them so i was only on a leave in thailand now and that kind of thing and some teas and stuff like that so i was like i have a very caring boyfriend that couldn't stand see me in pain went to a store and bought me cbd gums let me tell you people that [ __ ] should be illegal so i never took that thing before in my life right i never never tried i did try the cbd oil for a little bit but besides of the horrible taste i never saw any difference so i was like yeah well well i'm taking that if i don't see difference because i think it helps people with anxiety and stuff like that i don't have it so i don't i didn't see the point so he brought it to me and he said take it uh you wanna come it's good for you i got a few so i wanna it will help you with the pain so the pain that i have it's in the lower back it's a side effect of the surgery it's a terrible lower back pain like some days i couldn't even like move it was so bad so i was like okay um at that day when he brought it was a night and i said no i don't wanna because i was kind of like resistant to it but then the next day the next morning i woke up in such a huge pain and i was so sick and tired of taking a leave in tylenol and not seeing the results like not as quick but it lasts longer so i'm like i looked on the counter and here they are the cbd gummies so i rub them and i ate them and let me tell you huge mistake huge mistake after everything passed it was funny but at that moment i was pissed let me tell you why so it was i was trying to do something i needed to walk i really needed to walk and i woke up in that pain and i'm like i need to get something done and i can't be in pain i can't i just can't i have to get this done and i took it within i think 10 minutes maybe or less i start feeling like i was writing something and i started like couldn't connect the dot it's like i couldn't see the two plus two was four you know i mean like my brains would not admit that or i noticed something was wrong and i'm like okay something is wrong i had a ministry before so i was like i'm thinking oh my gosh i'm having a full-blown stroke now and because i'm on the blood thinner i a whole bunch of thoughts that went through my mind and i thought oh my gosh this is what it is uh i was home alone and i'm like oh my gosh what i'm gonna do what am i gonna do and i'm starting like freaking out thinking about it that i'm having a full full-blown stroke and i'm thinking what that might be am i having a blood clot or i'm having a stroke what's going on and for about i would say a minute or two all those thoughts were going through my mind right and i'm like oh my gosh but then i remember and i'm like oh lucy beauty gum i was so pissed i was like how i was so mad i was like i grabbed the phone i called my boyfriend lucky him he didn't answer because if he had the answer i would be like i would i had called him all kind of names by the time he called me back i was completely high already so for me it was funny right i i didn't yell at him i just left it off but let me tell you i don't get it i never will get why people want to get high that [ __ ] i really don't because it made me miserable like i'm telling you miserable the feeling was like so i'm hungry all of a sudden i'm hungry and i very very very rarely eat something in the mornings but and then when i got that feeling i was like oh my gosh i'm just high this is high and i'm thinking and then uh my brains start like powering up right your brain gets like this boost of thoughts that can't control and i'm thinking well i need to drink a coffee to kind of like counter affect the [ __ ] so i made a coffee while i was making a cough and i'm like hmm how cereal with coffee it's going to go oh i would need cereal when to get my cereal i put the cereal on the bow and then i'm eating the cereal and then all of a sudden my brain was giving me all this information about the cereal what was inside the cereal and how tasty that was and and i'm like i never tasted cereal that good before my life isn't that stupid and then i'm like i'm so hungry i'm so hungry i couldn't stop thinking about food so and then i i came to the couch i sat down and i'm like this has gotta go this has gotta and then i i was watching tv and then i could not understand the words like they were saying but it wasn't like i i couldn't understand and i'm like what the heck and i'm like and then i was thinking years ahead of whatever was happening my thoughts was ahead and i'm like my gosh what a confusion and i was hungry still hungry went back in the fridge it was like a little bowl of bean rice's inside that he had cooked like few days ago that was in the fridge still i took that out and i'm like oh my gosh this is delicious and it tastes so freaking good and i'm sure it didn't but for me it was the best taste ever and i started eating the beans and my brains started to scientifically tell me why the beans tasted that good and where the beans come from and and all that and i'm like oh my gosh what the heck is going on with me why can't i just eat the food and be quiet and make my brain stop and i could and let me tell you the top of everything i'm a vegan so hi and vegan don't go together they they don't go you can't i was like thinking about steak and i opened the present and i'm looking for some steaks and none and i'm like and then i saw some chicken uh i keep the chicken in the house because tommy eats them and james eats them so i saw some chicken but they were frozen and on my head was like how long would it take to defrost that and eat that because that taste that looks so tasty and i'm thinking what the heck i don't eat that so why is tasty and i'm like i was fighting to myself the entire time because my brain was in this weird place it was so weird and i'm like oh my gosh oh my god so after i ate my beans and rice that was in the bowl and it was the most delicious thing i ever in my life i still hungry somehow yep and this is how were talking about between eight o'clock and about 12 and one o'clock so between that and and those five hours i ate a bowl cereal i ate a bowl of rice and beans and then i ate a bowl of soup veggie soup that i had made few days ago that i it was in the fridge it wasn't bad because it didn't taste bad well i can't tell because everything tastes deliciously it's like my brain was the best cook that you ever see you know like those people in tv that they cook really really delicious there was the food that tasted to me my bud tastes were all over the place and then tommy called and said hey do you need something to eat i'm coming to to stay with you uh of course by then he called me back when he called me back i was all happy and stuff he goes like and i told him i say uh and he goes like oh my gosh you shouldn't ate though and i'm like i didn't know so now it's too late i'm high as [ __ ] and he goes like oh my gosh and i'm like and i headed to go to the office and i'm like i need to go to the office you need to go to the office he goes like no don't and i'm like i can't drive like that because i didn't know where it was i was all over the place i put microwave i put the soup on the microwave and then i came to the couch and i'm like i know i had something in the microwave so go back to the kitchen it was like the roller coaster it was awful so tommy brought me a pity like this big this big i ate probably in less than a minute yep falafel peanut butter delicious but those are delicious for real those are not a week old falafel those are delicious and i ate them and then i think like 20 minutes after i ate a whole salad from chick-fil-a and i'm like and i'm i still that time i was still like wanting some more food and it was awful it's just awful and i'm thinking god dang it why would people do that so i'm like i can't i even grasp the idea of doing that on purpose to myself hey i'm feeling fine let me get messed up in the hand because it's pretty cool i was like it makes absolutely no sense to get that way absolutely none it's like you can't control your thoughts they're way ahead of you i am a little control freak so i wanted to know everything that's going on around me i'm very i pay attention to more details than i should but i do and that day i couldn't and i was completely out of it like i was in the back seat and i never take the back seat i'm always the driver so for me it was awful like the worst experience ever and i'm thinking god damn it was funny it was funny because for some reason i had this huge sense of humor like everything was funny for me oh my pain was gone too positive side of it lost the pain no pain but i was so miserable i felt so out of place i felt so like my brains were so messed up that i honestly can't i can't grasp the idea why people do that on purpose like i did because i was dumb as [ __ ] and i couldn't get i well i didn't know too though that that thing would it was going to affect me that much but seriously i would never give that to my kid and i had people saying to me no you can give it to them you can give to kids because they help you kids with anxiety or whatever let me tell you never in a hundred million years we'll give that to my kid never i can't it's just like put him through what i went through not at all like not at all it's a it takes you away that that the feeling is awful i don't not recommend it do not unless if you want to be like that then then can't do nothing about it but oh my gosh so freaking awful it was the worst thing ever same time funny because it was accidental well i didn't know the power of that thing but not enjoyable i don't get why people do that on purpose because it's really not enjoyable it's not like you see stars or anything and it's not like you you are taking to the extra next dimension of everything whatever is just awful it didn't help with anything well it did i can't not say that it did not because it did it took away the pain but at the same time it took away me so no i like myself so not doing that people i do not recommend those at all especially if you have work to do especially if you're gonna go to work and be productive any and you need to continue to live your life unless if you want to be a couch potato or something and then okay you can take it and be in a couch all day because that's what happened to me that day i could not get out of it until later later later later and i don't even know if i got out of it because i remember tommy going home and i told him i say i want to go home or i want to go to bed earlier so go home and i remember him going home and then i went to bed and i kind of like passed out like i remember the next thing i remember was my alarm clock coming on and then i'm like uh why is my clock coming under like i just laid down i don't remember setting my alarm for this early and then i looked it was six o'clock the next day and i'm like holy [ __ ] it was time to get up and i was mad i was so mad the next day because i'm like i cannot believe i was my entire day like this feeling like this like for what so that that that's my thought on that i just it was funny when it was happening yes because i made huge mistakes that my normal self would make like for example i would never eat three bowls of different food one top of the other top of the other and they're all delicious never did never will but it's it's that feeling i just don't want to have it anymore i don't recommend it to anybody i really don't and the people that sell them should not sell them that [ __ ] should be illegal people cbd gummies should be illegal can't happen sorry i hope you all have a good night i hope god bless the entire week ahead of you we're gonna have an exciting week ahead of us god bless us all good night", "PAJTqqSkzsM": "hey my beautiful people it's your boy Tony and in this video I'm gonna share with you a three-day experiment of CBD edibles by Green world's world 100 milligram gummy froggies so what the hell is CBD and why am i taking it so CBD is a component of weed and weed is made up of five components CBD THC THC a CBN and CBC what THC does it gets you high and what other things do like CBD is give you medicinal benefits these medicinal benefits range from pain relief anxiety relief depression relief insomnia relief and can help battle cancer as well as diabetes I used to smoke a ton a ton of weed and THC never helped me out because I would be so panicky and I couldn't even go in social situations and I still somewhat battle with anxiety a little bit not too much as before and I completely stopped smoking so that's a good thing but I was always interested in CBD and what it could do because I've seen a lot of people actually get way better from actually taking CBD so green roads world they claim that they have the best CBD on the market because they go through an excruciating process with medical professionals you could check that all out in their link in the description they also have a ton of products like CBD oil CBD pills CBD Gummy's CBD syrup anything that you in mind could think of and they give a ton of information if you ever need some more of that so I paid $25 for this $25 I want to see if it's worth it and in this 3-day experiment I also want to show my different anxiety levels so my first day is gonna be somewhat of anxiety because I'm gonna meet the mayor the second day I'm not gonna have any anxiety at all because I'm not putting myself out of the comfort zone and my third day I have a performance so let's start with day one but before we start make sure you subscribe to my channel I post a lot of videos about life and everything beyond the threshold and post new videos every Tuesday and Friday I greatly appreciate that they wanted my CBD experiment I'm gonna try this out I have a meeting with the mayor today anxiety is it's not bad but it's a little bit a little something's there so I'm gonna try it a whole one I know you're supposed to only have half of it but see how that goes bottoms up they one of my CBD experiment is not complete my meeting with the mayor is perfect but as I was going there my anxiety was through the roof and I was getting a little bit tired around 2:00 p.m. I could just slept but besides that it didn't have any other negative effect on me stay tuned for day 2 and day 3 part 2 of my CBD experiment how I felt today felt pretty good just some thoughts on my head on life but you know that's the usual bottoms up day two is now complete and when I first ate the gummy today I felt a very strange sensation in the front of my head and in the back of my head I don't know what that meant but besides that I didn't really have much of a difference um I didn't overthink like I did in the beginning of the day I didn't have fatigue like I did yesterday maybe a little bit more happiness maybe a little bit more confidence but maybe that was just me today I don't know mate day number three is now coming your way they for performance day I have a performance in an hour I'm gonna take this purple gummy the last one I have so how did I feel in the morning I feel good I feel great but now I feel a little aggravated I don't know why so we'll see how this turns out I'll let you know day three not complete I didn't really feel much anxiety before I took the gummy and I didn't feel really much anxiety as I was there so I had a great performance though really good I got all my points across people clap so that's always a good thing all in all this product was ok let's start off with the taste first so I think it tastes like weed I gave one to my brother since it came before he said it didn't taste like weed and he didn't really have any effects from it either he was a little bit sleepy like I was on my first day but that's that I mean it takes it we but just was a dabble wheat so it's not really disgusting tasting it was fine to me um it may be disgusting to you but who knows what the effects it was very minimalistic I don't really want to blame my anxiety on the first day on these just because I don't know if that was me or if it was the product itself but yeah it was very minimalistic nothing really too crazy nothing really life-changing but I know the CBD works wonders for a ton of people with chronic illnesses chronic diseases and I know that certain products may work better for others so I don't want to completely knock these I don't want to completely knock these because this may work amazing for you they are actually some higher level ones like 300 milligrams so they are broken into four so 100 milligrams would be 25 per gummy the 300 milligram one would be 75 per gummy and I would try it out just because it is a higher level and I would love to review those but the price I mean yeah it's a little pricey but I'll say just try it out if you really need this obviously try it out and so leave a comment if you actually try these out before if you try it out green rolls rope leave a comment if you want to try them out and you don't know how you feel about it leave a comment if you just want to leave a comment just because leave a comment like if you liked this video and if you want to see me do another review on these and subscribe for more of my crazy antics infinite love infinite peace have a great day I greatly appreciate all of that if you did it for me you", "p6fnrYwPPGQ": "well hello everybody it's me autumn nice to see you guys live uh away from this channel for a while but you know just taking a little bit of time i started my new job and enjoying my time away from the internet so you know today i am here to talk to you guys a little bit about something that i've been using for the past two years now something that's really been helping me with my anxiety um cbd i credit cbd oil as being something that has helped me the most with my anxiety of anything i've never been on anti-anxiety medication this was kind of my way of seeing if i could self-medicate a little bit because i didn't want to deal with the possible side effects of anti-anxiety medication so yeah decided to try cbd oil i've been taking it for so long at this point that i don't really notice the effects unless i stop taking it i feel a lot more anxious my social anxiety in particular gets really bad overall just helps me feel more relaxed feel more normal feel more baseline so you may have noticed a couple days ago i posted on my twitter about how 5cbd which is a company that makes cbd products sent me some stuff some goodies they in particular sent me some full spectrum cbd gummies i will explain what all that means to you in a second but um i am going to be talking about how i felt about those and i'm also going to be answering some questions that you guys asked me on twitter so let's get into it so first let me show you guys um what they sent me because they sent me a bunch of stuff which is awesome so really quick just want to point out this box that they send it in because it was really cute it has all their branding on it and hey look you can find them on twitter facebook and instagram so really quick i'll show you guys two of the things that they sent me that i'm actually not really gonna be talking about today but still really cool products that they have and definitely worth checking out please excuse my beautiful acne uh i did not have time to put on makeup before i shot this video yay so one thing that they did send me they sent me these sleep gummies they have melatonin in it i haven't taken any because i don't like melatonin personally it tends to make me feel weird so i've been steering away from it but man if i liked melatonin i would definitely take them because cbd is super relaxing and will help you go to sleep they also sent me this tincture so it's just basically you put some of the drops under your tongue i'm definitely going to try this once i'm done with my current bottle of my current brand and finally this is what we're going to be talking about today this is called the daily buzz it is a daily use cbd full spectrum gummy all things that are really cool and i'll tell you guys why also i know this is obvious but it's worth saying i'm not a doctor i'm somebody who has just found relief with using cbd for my anxiety if you are ever planning on taking cbd discuss it with your doctor first especially if you're on any other kind of medication always a good thing to talk with your doctor before trying anything that is affecting your body in any way i think that's just a good mo to go with so cbd is short for cannabinoid oil it is the second most active ingredient in cannabis so five is the new cbd brand they have a full line of hemp products that i just showed you guys um it is all full spectrum so what is full spectrum what does that mean full spectrum cbd product is something that contains all of the different cannabinoids that exist inside of a hemp plant full spectrum products actually do this thing which is called the entourage effect so all the different natural cannabinoids all kind of work together um and boost each other up and give you different benefits so yeah five in particular is very meaningful about driving this relationship of all the different cannabinoids together making sure that you're getting a full spectrum product they're very particular about that which i appreciate because there's a lot more to cbd than just the cbd part so like i showed you guys earlier they do have a bunch of different products i showed you guys the sleep gummies i showed you guys a tincture but these boys let's talk about these boys today or girls or whatever they don't have to have a gender so they sent me these ones which are 50 milligrams of total cannabinoids per gummy these ones have 4.8 milligrams of thc in them that's kind of a lot for me i'm not gonna lie i'm very sensitive to thc i think i've said that already a couple times in this video they do however have an original strength which is 25 milligrams of total cannabinoids per gummy and it's only 0.8 milligrams of thc if you're really sensitive to thc i would suggest taking those i will say however even being sensitive to thc there was definitely a noticeable effect but it did not at all make my anxiety worse it did not at all make me feel bad in any way it was actually a really nice effect i was very relaxed i felt very alert and awake i felt very energized so it was a really nice effect i did notice the thc though and i'm just continuing to say that you know if you're somebody like me who's sensitive to that and maybe doesn't want that feeling all the time i would suggest the weaker gummies i didn't get to try them but i'm definitely going to because even with like me being as much of a baby with thc as i am i actually really enjoyed these and they made me feel really good the thc aside i also noticed what i noticed with my other cbd it made me feel a lot calmer it made me feel a lot more like i was just able to function normally as opposed to how i feel naturally i'm sure a lot of you can relate when you have anxiety it's kind of hard to just do anything like everything feels like a mountain that's been one of the best things about cbd and these were no different they made me feel the same way it just helped me kind of realize that those mountains that i'm climbing are actually like tiny little hills and i don't need to worry about them that much they also taste and smell like so good i keep opening them and just like sniffing them because they smell like candy and they taste like candy that's something that's really nice about these the normal cbd that i take is oil and it tastes very much like weed like it just tastes like dirt and weed this actually tastes good and it's like a daily cbd thing that i could also do so that is a huge plus this is also for what it is very cheap the current brand that i'm taking is really expensive i pay for it because obviously i was looking for a really good full spectrum product i was looking for something that had lab reports that i could verify you know everything they were saying about their product was accurate this has all that it's full spectrum you can go to their website and they have full lab reports breaking down everything that's inside the bottles and verifying everything that they say is inside the bottles like these extra strength ones of the daily buzz which is 30 gummies this is 60 the oil that i take is uh let's see i think the last bottle i spent like three hundred dollars on it and the ones that are the original strength or even cheaper they're forty dollars that's like a steal for cbd products so huge plus yeah i think in general i'm definitely going to continue to take these i probably will limit it to weekends or times when i'm not really doing too much again i personally am really sensitive to thc so i just try to be mindful of that but i'm definitely planning on buying the original strength ones and trying those out as more of a daily thing that i can take i've been looking for a long time for another cbd brand that i can take in conjunction with what i'm taking now and hey these are cheaper if the original strength gummies are good i might entirely get rid of my other brand and just switch to these oh my god i wish i could transmit a smell through the camera they smell so good and i think i just want candy it's almost halloween right five cbd is actually offering a free bottle of the daily buzz gummies right now again that's like you know a 60 value for free i mean you have to pay shipping whatever all right so now i'm going to answer the questions that you guys asked me on twitter this is kind of a topic that i'm very interested in and something that i've been exploring over the past two years and so yeah hopefully this is helpful to those of you who suffer from anxiety and want to try something to see if it helps all right so this question is from humanoid sharks on twitter they asked i struggle with bad insomnia and recently started vaping thc weedpod things to help me sleep it does the job but the problem is i don't like being goofy high every night with cbd help me fall asleep and more importantly stay asleep yes for me it definitely does that i think just because in general it lowers your anxiety for me it just brings me back down to a baseline where everything is easier like i have more of an appetite i'm more able to perform at work i'm more able to do social things and yes i'm able to sleep easier because my anxiety in general is lowered kind of in the same vein ll coolray14 asks i know cbd can help with sleep but do you ever feel drowsy when waking up that's my biggest concern no i don't feel with my normal cbd that i take i don't feel anything i never feel groggy i never feel weird i never feel high even these like when i took them that one day i didn't feel groggy waking up i didn't feel groggy at all and i actually felt extremely well rested the next morning so no no grogginess this question is from one armed gambit and they asked i suffer from bad pain due to cerebral palsy which usually ends up with me not getting any sleep with cbd help me with pain and or sleep thank you so i don't use it for pain primarily i do have chronic bladder pain um but i never used cbd to treat that really so i can't really speak to it i will say that i can't remember the last time i had a flare-up now whether or not that coincides with the cbd use i couldn't really say i haven't really been tracking it i will say there are tons of people out there who speak specifically to the fact that cbd has helped them tremendously with their pain their chronic issues cbd works with your own body's endocannabinoid system it's one of the regulatory systems that's naturally found in your body it's not to be one of the things that regulates you and kind of keeps you out of homeostasis if you're experiencing pain i definitely suggest trying it again talk to your doctor first before trying anything but there's so many people who swear by this stuff for pain give it a shot so this question is from pink hardy and they asked as someone who uses weed daily what are their feelings like compared to each other so i don't like weed i don't really smoke it ever i don't really enjoy how it makes me feel this stuff made me feel so like energized and just i felt so relaxed like i don't know how to describe it i just felt like everything was fine normal and like i could carry on about my life without having to worry about anything it was a very pronounced effect and it was great it's very different from weed i wouldn't even compare the two to be honest this question is from mr tom finney who asks what aspect of anxiety do they help with can they help you manage scenarios that trigger panic attacks like flying or public speaking etc so cbd is not something that i think you should use as like a break the glass emergency panic scenario for me again it's been something that i take every day that's kind of an upkeep thing although i guess depending on how you react to something like this that has a little bit more thc in it this might actually help in a situation like that but again i would take this particular strength on a day where you're not doing anything you're not doing anything stressful just to see how it makes you feel okay this question is from demon locks they asked how does it help you is it more of a daily dose where you take a small amount a day or do you take the cbd when you're feeling anxious how do you regulate it do you just dose with pills or do you dose with other forms i've actually answered some of these but i'll go through this anyway so how does it help me the most pronounced area that cbd helps me is with my social anxiety before i started taking cbd i really could not like function around other people i was just really shy and really nervous i didn't enjoy interacting with people that is one of the first things that cbd really really helped me with it lowered my social anxiety so much it also helped my general anxiety just come down like a couple notches which is really helpful just in my life i'm a much more confident person now i'm a much more reasonable person now um i know anxiety is a struggle for a lot of people because it makes life feel impossible in general it's helped everything kind of just screw down a couple notches which is awesome so that's how it's helped me how i take it so i take my cbd oil sublingually so under the tongue i put it under my tongue for about a minute every morning when i wake up i take it with the rest of my vitamins take it after i eat the cbd that you get will give you instructions on how to take it best they'll give you dosing amounts you should kind of test it out to see what feels best for you but to start with a really low dose and to kind of work your way up you just never really know everybody's different so you can't really tell um from the start how you're going to react to it so this question is from leijen sirket and they asked are you clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or is this more minor anxiety i say minor in quotes because obviously anxiety is awful so i'm clinically diagnosed with general anxiety disorder i don't think that's rare nowadays there's a whole lot of stuff to be anxious about i'm someone who like has clinical anxiety i could get medication for it if i wanted it and cbd has been more than enough to help me with the day-to-day managing of it the amount of functioning that cbd has given back to me is huge no shame if you need medication a lot of people do our brains are different some people need more help than others and this is the last question i'm going to take from you guys this is from an epic nguyen on twitter they asked does cbd help with mental clarity i.e help to keep the mind focused and on task absolutely that's something i can emphatically say this stuff not gonna lie i was expecting it to make me feel high i was expecting it to make me feel groggy i was expecting me to be couched a little bit it didn't do any of those things it made me feel really energetic it made me feel very clear i was very productive that day all right well hopefully that helped some of you honestly i learned a lot about cbd on the cbd subreddit so shout out to that place that's a really good spot to go if you're like curious about cbd and kind of curious about what will work for you and what's a good place to buy products from because there's a lot out there there's a lot of sketchy cbd companies out there five cbd is awesome again they have their lab reports on their website so you can verify everything that they're telling you is true please look for that if you're looking for a cbd brand it's really really important so yeah hopefully this was helpful to you guys again 5cbd is currently giving away a free bottle of this stuff the daily buzz gummies the link for that is in the description it is a limited time offer but you can snag you one right now so again that link is in the description below and hey just for ships and giggles i'll put it up on the screen oh my god i know this is the first time i've been back and it's like a sponsored video sorry if you're expecting something different but you know again i'm just settling into my new job i am relaxing i'm getting the hell away from the internet it feels good i will be back at some point i don't know when i don't know why i don't know how um but i'll be around hopefully this was something fun in the meantime if any of you ever have other questions about cbd about five cbd in particular or about anything else please feel free to ask me i love this stuff i find it very interesting or again i will plug the cbd subreddit i think it's a really good place to go to find good information please make sure you're talking to your doctor before trying anything cbd related please also make sure that you are verifying that the cbd you're getting is from a good source well i hope everybody has a great day today thank you so much for tuning in and i will talk to you guys when i talk to you guys peace", "qvokPiydgAA": "hey guys my name is Sharia I live in Orlando Florida and I am getting ready to take my CBD gummy I am really really excited to give it a try I struggle with anxiety and I also have like chronic back pain and it always feels them inflamed and it just sometimes gets to the point that is just miserable i prescribed hydrocodone Xand I take three different of their pills to help with my back but I've always really wanted to try something that's a little bit more down the natural route so I am super excited and I will give you my review as soon as I you know start to feel the effects hopefully okay so I started off by eating half of the gummy and I wasn't really sure what I should be feeling or if it was gonna be like this rush of I don't know it was some sort of feeling so I waited about 3045 minutes before I eat the second half after I did that probably twenty minutes later I definitely say that I felt much more relaxed as you can see I'm just laying in bed my back feels really good obviously it's like mat not like magically healed but I am really looking forward to spending the next few hours just not thinking about what kind of pain my back is in and actually being able to just lay here even without my back necessarily throbbing or hurting me so this is really really really exciting and I am really thrilled that I ended up trying this product", "O6-wdJagsYk": "just want to say this upfront this is not a sponsored video so there's not going to be any discount codes or anything of that nature throughout this video however the company that I will be talking about did send me some product to try out for free but I'm not letting that influence what I'm about to say you see a lot of these CBD videos that get put out there and people are paid so they're more influenced to say certain things to make the product seem a little bit more promising than what it may be so just want to make you guys aware of that now let's start the video well so now guys welcome to a brand new video thank you for stopping by I really do appreciate it as always so the topic at hand CBD oil you've seen a ton of this on social media I'm sure of it everybody proclaiming that it is the number one care to literally everything under the Sun from anxiety to inflammation joint pain migraines anything can be cured with a few drops of CBD oil but is this actually the truth a company called herb strong and I'm sure you've heard of them before they contacted me about four or five weeks ago asking me if I'd like to try out one of their products for free and me being the curious person that I am I just wanted to see what the hype was all about and I did my research on it so that I wouldn't get tested positive in a drug test which I will touch on later so they decided to send me their $65 bottle of 1000 milligram full-spectrum hemp oil and if you want to see how I reacted to it what my thoughts are on it then you can just go to this time stamp right here but first I think we have to talk about what CBD actually is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol is actually one of over 100 different chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are exclusive to the cannabis plant now the really cool thing about the human body is that we actually have a couple of receptors known as cb1 and cb2 that are cannabinoid receptors now the cb1 receptors are responsible for psychoactive effects so when you consume something that has a strong affinity for this receptor and makes it active such as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC you're going to experience things that come with being high impaired movement impaired vision you might forget a few things anything comes up being high it's because of the cb1 receptors being active now the cv 2 receptors are actually found in the immune system and these are meant to actually help the human body which is why you see these CBD oil companies proclaiming that they're going to help things like anxiety migraines inflammation joint pain that's because CBD actually has a strong affinity for the cb2 receptors and when active they're supposedly supposed to help with all these things now is this stuff legal to purchase yes and no it really does all depend because boom people hear the word cannabis they instantly freak out it is 100% legal I'm going to stay away from it with a 50-foot pole however it really all depends from a technical standpoint as long as somebody contains 0.3% or less THC then it is perfectly legal to purchase however anything over that threshold is obviously illegal that's why you see things such as hemp powder being sold in grocery stores because it really doesn't contain any THC now this does not mean that it's not going to show up on a drug test like I did say before 0.3% or less if it contains 0.2% if there's a chance that it's going to show up on a drug test so just make sure you are doing a research before purchasing anything CBD related now the company herb strong they did send me some product and I like I said before I did my research before even saying yes to the free products just to make sure that it didn't contain any THC and I took a look at their lab report and I took a look at the left hand bottom of the report and it said that it did not contain any detectable amounts of THC so as I said before if you plan on purchasing something just make sure that you do some research on whatever company it is and make sure that there's no detectable THC in their products because this is a powered looking Channel and I do compete in the USA PL which is an IPF affiliate let's talk about wada for a second or the world anti-doping agency let me take a look at their banned substances list and you're going to see that cannabinoids are actually on their banned list however they do make an exception for cannabidiol which as I did mention before is CBD but as I did mention if your product that you are consuming does contain traceable amounts of THC then you are going to test positive for drugs in your system so as I keep harping on make sure you do your research on any of these products that are CBD related now that we have all that sciency stuff out of the way let's talk about my experience with CBD oil now again I do compete and tested Federation didn't want to take anything that would end up biting me in the ass for lack of better terms which is why I gave the okay to Armstrong to send me out some of their stuff because from what they said it doesn't contain any traceable amounts of THC now I don't suffer from anxiety or migraines multiple sclerosis anything of that nature all I really do suffer from is some joint pains and some inflammation maybe my sleep quality could have improved a little bit but really nothing on the mental health side of things more so just actual physical pains that I do suffer from so I was hoping by taking this product it would help out with those pains a little bit so I followed the instructions for about a week five drops underneath the tongue both in the morning and at night so it's ten drops a day on an empty stomach and after the first week really didn't experience anything at all took a little bit the email one more time and said to give it a couple of weeks so I gave it another seven days same thing five drops in the morning and at night ten drops a day 140 drops over a span of two weeks and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit my joint pains were still there inflammation was still there nothing had really gone away now I was giving it one more week but I actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's sixteen drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which what I was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that I did experience so I am a little bit disappointed with that so this really isn't a product that I'm going to be using in the future I actually ended up giving the remaining of the remainder of the bottle to someone at work that does suffer from anxiety and hopefully it does help them out a little bit more than I did help me but I just want I just wanted to put out this video to spread a little bit of truth when it does come to the use of these products just make sure that you are doing your research on all this stuff because you really don't want to be wasting $6,500 on something that's potentially not going to work now going back to the whole sleep quality thing can I take this to improve my sleep quality sure am I going to know because I think there's better ways to improve overall sleep quality such as getting some blackout curtains to make sure that it's pitch-black in your room regulating your room temperature so you're always sleeping in the same temperature every single night and just getting more hours of sleep if you like you could improve your sleep quality for a set price of maybe like fifty bucks instead of always spending sixty five dollars a month which can really add up over time and end up being a waste of money if you could do it in a much cheaper fashion so yeah that was pretty much my experience with CBD maybe it just didn't work out for me I'm not sure but I really don't see myself using this product in the future and just be weary of other people that are saying that it's curing everything that is wrong with them because I for one didn't experiences I did a post on Reddit and other people were saying that they experienced pretty much the same thing that I did with CBD oil where their inflammation and joint pain really didn't go away there were some people that did say that it did help out with our migraines but again I don't suffer from those so I can't really speak on those so to say so yeah that's my experience with CBD oil hope you don't hate me for it if you did enjoy the video or you just feel it does deserve one please be sure to drop in to thumbs up because it helped does help to channel out a lot more than you do think if you want to see any more of my videos and please be sure to sub to the channel and hopefully I'll see you with that next one [Music]", "dOwyRDIo1Do": "oh my god it smells so good hmm now he's a bath bomb CBD bath bomb wow that's all smells like laundry detergent oh this is so good we got some gummies blue raspberry rings 500 milligrams each when I walk my load hold the bag oh nice okay so this is just the CBD oil I wonder what thing it cuz that was just like oh and honey okay sweet oh I should know it's got like a little honey of yours I'm actually like most excited for this because I've never tried the actual oil that you just drip I think it's a new tongue right whatever I'll read it in a second but I've never tried this before and I'm excited oh you put it on your phone oh whoa I actually you know what I would actually use the out of this with my ID in my debit card in there nice okay we got some pain cream here 100 milligrams last but certainly not least a nice little rolling tray thank you guys you know I smoke weed a biodegradable rolling tray that's cool nice feels really weird because it's my first sponsored video so I just want to start off by saying I actually do really like CBD and I've been using it for a while the last time you guys see me talk about CBD it was actually a funny story I had my mom bring me like a little gummy bears and then a pain cream that was CBD to the hospital and I was doing daily vlogs back when I was just in the hospital blogging and um and I blogged about it and I don't know who in that hospital was stocking my but they saw that I had CBD and they're like well that's a drug and we need to search the rest of your things to make sure that you're not hiding any other drugs and I was like bro it's not like um in here shooting up meth or known smoke man showed us how much I know about drugs like I'm in here eating a CBD gummy bear and now you guys are gonna go like literally search my entire hospital room and they did and they didn't find anything go figure okay anyways moving on but this is my first sponsored video it's sponsored by just CBD I really like them I had them send me a couple of things to try out before I made a video just because I wanted to make sure I actually liked it before it's like hey guys go spend your money on this and it's something that I have never tried I wouldn't like that if somebody did that to me so I'm not going to do that to you guys so they sent me the gummies which I'm on my last one so I'm really happy that things like me more and I did it just empty it I actually take these like every day and then they also sent me like a roll on roll on fries pain relief this okay this Sun is gonna start coming in take this for the eared it's half of my face wow that's really great oh nice thank you cloud anyways like I was saying the blue line my son's that I've asked blue eyes are like sorry I'm gonna be squinting probably the rest of stuff yeah all right so I did try this and I'm actually gonna use this right now because it's been a long day for me and my shoulders are hurting but this the best way to describe this is if you've ever used Biofreeze it reminds me of that but it has CBD in it so it's like Biofreeze on steroids it's just better than Biofreeze because it has the CBD in it and I feel like it feel like it is colder than Biofreeze to and I love that it's a Rollie so you can get hard-to-reach spots see I'm citizens okay okay so the freeze is 350 milligrams and the cream is 100 milligrams just want to give you guys some milligrams cuz that actually matters and let me just yeah I'm really excited about this but I don't take baths because getting in another about tub in a wheelchair I've seen people do it online but I'm just not ballsy enough to try it but common-sense water body that will still work in the shower so I'm actually really excited to try this it really smells like laundry detergent and everybody knows there's no better smell in the world the motion detection I'm excited too like a picture it's really good it's hard to keep one it's actually they taste like candy mmm zero fat zero cholesterol two grams of carbs one gram of sugar is not bad at all well it's got like nothing in a festive eating exam many calories 5 colors nice and then there's 24 and each container just giving you guys the facts you know you know what I'm going to do because mmm because this is only 100 milligrams I'm gonna mix it with the roll-on it should make a difference so it's got a little pump I'll show you this if you like a real youtuber one I guess it's not really thick it's like in between being sick and wiry it's really nice consistency doesn't like anything it's unscented which is nice not only because that's like extra chemicals but I have really sensitive skin so when stuff has fragrance it makes me break out a lot of times okay so I take these dummies everyday and at first I was using them to help fall asleep at night but I already take I have insomnia and I have medication that I take a night telling me sleep so I don't know how much of it was the gummies or how much medicine so I took it during the day the next day and it does make you a little tired almost like the equivalent of smoking weed like you get a little tired from it but it's not something that you wouldn't be able to take during the day because it's gonna make you too tired so the best way to describe how they make you feel is I live in the city I live in Chicago if you don't know this so there's a ton of people there's a ton of tourists and a lot of the times when I go out little things that people do that shouldn't your take me because it's just it's not a big deal they do irritate me like if I hold the door for somebody and they don't say thank you I'm literally that person that goes yeah you're welcome like if you think I'm such a blunt  sometimes but these the easiest way to describe it is it makes you just not care if that person doesn't say think holding the door for them it's just like it makes putting up with idiots easier mmm like it sounds bad but there's a lot of them in this world and we can use something to help us deal with that and this so if you don't want to smoke weed and you want the same like not giving a feeling CBD it actually does do exactly what I just said so I'm gonna assume that five hundred fifty milligrams famous the chewy it's nice okay I'm gonna assume that the oil does the same thing but since I just took one of the gummies I don't want to take the oil because I'm not gonna know which one is the oil would be able to give you like full it should have thought about that before I just got too excited in any one you know what I'll take this in a little bit once this wears off and then I'll try this and I'll do it on camera just so that you guys can see because I I feel like I'm doubling everything right now like I just put on the fries and I'm the cream which I'm not gonna lie to you I have really done that pain ever since you know I broke my neck so ever since that I deal with really bad chronic constant chronic pain and I don't take any pain killers for it I don't get any cortisone shots I used to and I'm gonna start again actually but at the moment I don't so it's really nice to have like an option where I don't have to smoke weed like if I'm going to meeting and my modeling agency I can just use something like this instead of having to smoke weed before something important like that you won't have to suffer through the pain because I'm not gonna smoke weed before important meetings like that so I just suffered through the pain when it comes to that so it's nice to have something that I could use during the day and you know professionals that nice and but I'm not gonna lie my neck actually feels really good right I think the mixture of the roll-on fries the cream and the gummy is making my pain a lot better right now Wow I've been up since 6:00 a.m. I had to go to an appointment so I've been up and about and in my chair for what times you know like five so I've been up for 11 hours in my chair now so my neck usually starts to hurt after like three hours but now I don't really I'm not even just saying this but you guys - it really does feel good like this that hurt but like I have full range of motion right now and I'm not wincing usually I'm like if I do what I just did Wow guys I remember saying this the first time I ever tried CBD I was like wow I wasn't expecting anything but that just really impressed me put this thing on my phone yeah tonight what I'll do is when all of this wears off I'll try this because the thing that I was most excited to try and then it was just the bottom of the box so now I'm like I really want to try this so imma try this tonight and we're gonna see how it works but in the meantime let's put this cute little wooden we call it mobile pouch my phone but just stuff in there nice I went it's a rubber to it like that [Music] can represent everywhere echo Mini's and then Milo they were thinking about you - yeah you got your football bags I wonder if you get to offset the oil I mean I see people getting their dogs CBD treats what's difference right it's just funny make a good dog for me should I or shouldn't I maybe I should just wait until I get dog shits out become dog CPD treats will get you some CBD too so you don't feel like you're losing out okay I can't really show you guys that's what I'm gonna do I was just gonna say I can't show you guys you know me testing out the bath bomb but tonight when I take a shower I'm gonna use this and then I'm gonna take some of the oil you know take some oil that way I'll have tried everything and can give you a full review right all right well that's everything until then I'm gonna go make use of mine biodegradable roaming trick okay I'll see you guys tonight okay so I just got out of the shower and I used the bath bomb oh my god I mean no I'm smelling bath bomb if I could just smell myself I smell good see I've never used a bath bomb because I don't take baths so I never understood the whole thing but my skin is so soft and I smell so good oh my god now I see why everybody's so obsessed literally smells like laundry detergent no I smell like longitude it hurt oh I love it okay so I have the drops right here and I'm going to go take one to two times and hold under your tongue for 30 to 60 seconds okay this is to shake it really good someone may shake it says to hold under tongue for 30 seconds so be like what are you doing good I should put down in my tea wow they taste really good well it's hard to like not take more because it tastes really good okay well I'm gonna go wal kay Milo hmm I don't want to say it um I'm gonna go do that and then by the time I get back this should all kick in these drops I do feel relaxed but I mean I did take a lot of CBD today I mean I put the roll on the cream and I took a 500 milligram gummy and then I just bathed myself in CBD and now I just took some CBD honey so I'm probably gonna sleep like the best I've ever slept in okay well I just got inside and I am ready for bad I don't know if you can tell by my voice but I'm so tired I don't know if it's all of this CBD that my body has consumed today but I'm like oh I'm just ready for bed so yeah today was fun I actually really enjoyed doing this whole unboxing try it out for the first time I've never done anything like this so it was pretty cool um it really helps that I like CBD so I knew I would most likely like these products but I really liked the bath bomb and I know you're probably thinking your hair is and wet like you didn't take a shower but I just washed my hair this morning so I didn't wash it again cuz I'm gonna have to restrain it and whatever but that bath balm I just went in the elevator when I was walking my low to go walk my low I'm sorry I'm like really out of it I don't know if it's like the oil or what but I'm like really tired all of a sudden I think it's that oil cuz I'm like feeling stupidly tired but um I got an elevator and Cindy was like oh my god he smells so good and I was like think it sounds like it's this bath bomb I didn't say it like that um that it more casually but it's like yeah it's this new bath bomb that I got and even they said they're like you smell like um fabric softener I was like bro that's what I it smells like tied it smells so good

cookies brownies and other food or drinks that contain cannabidiol CBD is typically used for its prospective health advantages in edible products are fantastic way to take CBD as a dietary supplement this is great because as a consumer you might want to have a few different options offered for the form that your CBD products come in let's back up a bit we review precisely what CBD is CBD is short for kin of video which is a chemical compound from the cannabis plant can a video is one of the many cannabinoids that occur naturally in the hemp plant individuals frequently misunderstand what CBD actually is and assume that it's the same as cannabis CBD is in fact the non psychoactive portion of the cannabis plant some people are concerned about CBD products making them high but complete spectrum CBD contains no more than 0.3% concentration of THC which is the part of the cannabis plant that triggers that high feeling they're also broad-spectrum CBD isolate products which contain absolutely no THC for those that are not comfortable with even a lower amount of THC in their CBD products so our CBD edibles of good alternative to CBD oil products CBD products are extremely popular these days and there are now various methods to administer CBD besides just the basic CBD oil drops and CBD edibles is one of them CBD oil is administered under the tongue and held for at least 60 seconds the CBD oil is taken in through a membrane under the tongue and then swallowed CBD edibles are consumed in the very same way as food to put it simply the CBD instilled edibles are chewed and consumed like food and enter the gastrointestinal system where it can start to do its work on the endocannabinoid system keep in mind that there is a distinction between how long it takes for CBD to kick in with CBD edibles as opposed to using CBD oil CBD oil takes about 15 minutes to take effect however CBD edibles can take a lot longer in some cases 30 minutes to two hours so this is very important to know if you are using CBD edibles for pain this does not minimize the efficiency of the CBD but merely delays absorption a little are there negative effects of CBD edibles CBD can

hemp bombs and then come back and watch this because you're gonna be shocked because these results are a little different than all the happy lies you're being told let's see my lab results they claimed 300 milligrams of CBD and we found only a hundred and seven milligrams of CBD or 64 point four percent less bombed F rating 107 milligrams not three hundred it really is shocking that all these great reviews out there they get a commission for helping sell this product by doing reviews this isn't in my interest to do but the truth is more important and those reviews aren't gonna change after they see my lab results they'll just carry on more on that in a second here's the official lab test it's just one test I don't claim all products will test this way hold that thought too about one test price obviously it's ridiculous because this is based on the lab report and when you're missing a whole bunch of CBD the price goes way up here's the crazy part absolutely insane nbc6 investigators found their 15 milligram gummies contained only 2.2 milligrams of CBD not 15 2.2 CBS 58 found their products didn't even contain CBD none no CBD and they tested at two different labs none nbc4 purchased five hemp bombs products and they had less than half the amount advertised bomb this is a huge company out of Florida how are they doing this I am blown away oh yeah they also own nature script apparently and we tested that product and the results were very similar they bombed I just can't believe there are so many YouTube reviews out out there saying how great this product is in so many review sites when clearly if you just if you just google it if you just go on the news you can see all of these it's not hidden all of these negative portes well this can't go on forever

have had one of the worst years of my life and I'm not exaggerating especially the past a month and a half and Quarantine did not make it much better it did give me a lot of time to reflect and work on myself which I have been doing and I'm very grateful and thankful for that but I also made it really really really hard I've been anxious I've been depressed I've been sad I've been happy I've been angry I've been every emotion you can think of is what I've been in the past month in that I suffer with anxiety yes a lot of you guys know and I'm sure do being anxious all the time is not fun and I've tried different CBD products in the past some have worked for me some haven't I've dealt with symptoms such as like itching and just like dry mouth or like certain things like that with different CBD products so I am here to talk about sugar and cush it's a new CBD line that I am trying it's gonna walk you through every product that I have and talk a little bit about it something that I liked about the CBD line is that they don't just have the droplets that you can put in your mouth they also have bath balm like so cool look at the packaging a pink and white bomb it has a zero THC in it lab tested cruelty free hand craft it and it's all-natural ingredients and it's meant to basically just calm you down it's smells like roses it's called a truce we're actually pink rose I wish I had but I don't I'm gonna give this to my mom she's gonna love it she has a Jacuzzi on their website they actually have a lab results that you can pull up in view for yourself this is their gummybear CBD dummies it's recommended to take one to two a day little gummies and they're a natural flavor gummy vitamins are kedo friendly which is a plus if you are on keto diet next is their drops these are CBD drops that you just drop underneath your tongue the packaging is so cute they are glass this is the hazelnut and the bubble gum the directions say place one fill dropper under your tongue one to two times daily and adjust as desired if one drop under my tongue works for me and two works for someone else that's kind of what you're trying to figure out how much will work for you you're not supposed to feel a high or anything you're just supposed to feel relaxed and calm and like your anxiety goes away going to go and try the hazelnut CBD so you just take the syringe do 54 now and you're supposed

thanks for watching", "pRQQqKUyIro": "[Music] hello my name is Jennifer Dixon with the green valley nation and today I want to give you a really quick review on the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD this is a highly concentrated product that claims to be great for sports recovery folks suffering from anxiety issues and insomnia and sleep related issues Charlotte's Web grows and processes all of their hemp in Colorado they use organic non-gmo and vegan friendly products to make a full spectrum CBD using co2 extraction methods the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD comes in chocolate mint flavor it has 60 milligrams of CBD per each suggested serving size of one milliliter there are two current sizes which are 30 milliliter and 100 milliliter which gives you at least in this bottle eighteen hundred milligrams and then in the 100 milliliter bottle it gives you 6,000 milligrams of CBD because this is a full-spectrum product there is a little bit of THC in it but it's less than 0.3 percent and so it won't get you high let's talk about the packaging on the outside of both the box and the bottle is a picture of the Rocky Mountains a kind of tribute to where they are located and on the outside of the box is a QR code it's on the bottom right hand side that you can scan and get the analysis and the information about the particular product you'll find that each bottle inside of the box is individually wrapped with cellophane so that you know that it's new and that it has the ingredients and it has the suggested serving size of one milliliter because this is a full spectrum oil you'll notice that it is a little bit darker and greener in color than an ISIL it might be that also means that the flavor is going to be a little stronger now Charlotte's Web does use a chocolate mint flavor in this product but that doesn't necessarily mean it covers up all of the flavors let's try it you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to hold it for at least 30 to 60 seconds the first thing that you're gonna notice after taking this product is that even though it is supposed to be chocolate mint flavored it doesn't taste super chocolaty just a little bit minty you're gonna still taste the plant it's a it's a full spectrum product so it definitely has that plant flavor to it however within 15 minutes you're gonna notice that you're calmer that you can focus a little better and that if you have any residual pain because it's so concentrated this stuff knocks it out pretty well now for me I'm very sensitive and I react very very quickly and strongly to CBD so I don't need very much I use like a few drops maybe a quarter of a dropper full and that will last me all day for you if you are a little less sensitive to it or you are dealing with a higher amount of anxiety or pain you might have to use the full suggested serving size of one milliliter and it may not last you all day you might have to take this every four to six hours it really just depends on how your body reacts and responds to it and then how quickly it metabolizes the CBD you can also find that when you take this before bed it'll help you to relax and go to sleep I find that when I take it before sleeping it puts me to bed like that and then I can sleep the whole night which is glorious let's talk value here this is considered a premium product so it is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum if this is not something that you're generally as concerned about then it's a perfect product for you however if you live on a pretty tight budget this could be a difficult addition to your daily routine if flavor is also a big thing for you this might not be the best option because it definitely does still have a strong earthy plant flavor there is a hint of but if you're very sensitive to taste in flavors then I would definitely not recommend this product for you overall I really do like the the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD oil it does what it says it's supposed to do help you to relax it definitely helps me to sleep and it definitely does help to manage my aches and pains I can't recommend it if you are looking for something that is on a budget because this is a little bit more on the higher end of the spectrum but it is a great product high quality every single time I take it it's the exact same and if you're not as sensitive to flavors it's going to get the job done pretty quickly because it's so concentrated so you might not need as much thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and if you liked it make sure you subscribe to this channel for the most comprehensive library of hemp products thanks again see you soon bye bye [Music]",

not try this product this is for 18 and up wrong folks no little kids do not try this product if you are not an adult thank you proceed to the recent video hey guys I'm back with another video so basically this video is gonna be different it's gonna be a product review for something that I've been meaning to try I was kind of not really worried but I did a lot of research on it and this is just something that I've been meaning to try hopefully bringing you in my video you in my video okay I like I was saying before um this product is something that I've been meaning to try and so yeah as you guys know I deal with anxiety and depression and haven't really been sleeping and part of it is because of my anxiety and depression and so I was asking my Twitter followers like what else I could do to basically do because I'm always irritated I work with kids so it just makes it 10 times worse to the point where I like don't go to work because I know I'm gonna be irritated I just need something to mellow me down but that was legal I do not smoke weed I don't smoke cigarettes I don't smoke anything I don't like the way it smells I'm like when smoke gets into my hair so smoking weed was just out of the question there's nothing against people who smoke weed I just don't so one of my followers recommended CBD oil or CBD gummies or whatever so like hmm ok [ __ ] so I did look it up and research it basically it comes from like a cannabis cannabis plant but it's not marijuana basically whatever is in like we'd like the THC that's not in these gummies but it still kind of gives you the same effect maybe just not as high that's how I understood it but basically it's like gummies without the legal stuff in it but it still gives you kind of the same effect so the gummies that I picked up from Amazon where these hemp gummies excuse me on these hemp gummies they are 30 thousand million in each gummybear has 250 milligrams of him ashtray in each one and it comes with a total of 120 these were well I was this video was all over the place these were $24.99 I think on Amazon and they got here literally within two days so wow yeah I literally ordered these yesterday and they got here today so real quick I'm opening for you so that you guys can see them so yes I'm excited to try these make mostly because of for my anxiety and my depression and also it's like asleep there very soon um only thing that I'm not sure about is if you take a drug test if it will show up my director I did a lot of research and they say that it waited because it doesn't have THC in it but I mean I don't know you might want to try that yourself I was trying to look for a drug test my story to take so that I can let you guys know or not they smell like sorry guys I checked but I can't find one so yeah it's up to you teacher them you know used to your discretion thank smell like organic coming berries I know if you ever had like gummies like health gummies and they smell like a whole bunch of fruits and vegetables mixed up together that's what they smell like I also want to note that whenever you do search CBD or gummies on Amazon all of these hemp oil products are gonna come up I read somewhere that Amazon can't sell CBD oil products I don't know if they're just disguising it as hemp oil or if it's really just hemp oh but just also pay attention to that whenever you do order they're like the meaning of evaders so it stays for the take to the day like one in the morning one at night but since I just got these imma go ahead and just take two I see what happens so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take them so I'm gonna take a green and a red one for Christmas and then I'm gonna come back 30 minutes later and let you know that it's a snake burglar coming beers already come back okay so real quick why I'm 20 sorry for smacking the ingredients say if they have him pimp extract him or omega three six and nine vitamin E and vitamin B other ingredients include corn syrup sugar water and gelatin citric acid natural and artificial flavors Connor Bo carnem hmm some plant leaf wax oh the other number five and number six red number forty and blue number one so yeah great taste so far I took two so that was 500 milligrams that I just took today so I'm gonna be back and let you guys know how I'm feeling hey guys so real quick I wanted to come back and come back come back and give you all an update on the gummies I know set up on come back 30 minutes later but I actually kind of decided to just maybe sleep on it and see how I sleep to give you guys a better review because honestly didn't feel anything which is kind of a good thing there's no side effects of the gummies I slept fine I took something this morning I've been very active I Oh actually after I took me I cleaned my room okay my bathroom today I went out and ran errands actually got off the bed I woke up early too so it's definitely giving me energy um I'm not really sad at the same time I also got paid so I might one during the review and I'm broke just being honest but so far so good I'm just happy there's no side effects of it I don't feel high I don't feel woozy I just feel happy like I generally have like no nothing back to say about it I don't feel angry or sad and oh so funny so last night I was looking for shoe this is really awkward a random story but I was looking first shoe last night and I found myself like getting angry but then I was just like like I got mad for like they're like five seconds I was like you know what I can't give that other things I can't control like stop getting mad over things retain control so I just you know brushed it off took a deep breath brushed it off can't clean in my room and then something told me to look in a certain spot it was an awkward spot a spot where a shoe should not be in and that's where my other shoe was and it's so funny because I feel like I don't know if I've ever told you this but I think I'm kind of psychic and I feel like these gummi bears opening my third eye a little bit and maybe tapping to my psychic abilities because the way I found that shoe yesterday there was no way to be God so I don't know that's just my experience with a gun me so far so good no complaints I would definitely recommend them if you feel like you need something and even if it's just all in my head and they really don't work I'm just happy I don't feel a high I don't feel a buzz I don't feel sleepy none of that I got slept great last night they're just good I liked them so far so if you're interested in them I'll link them down below thank you guys for watching until next time bye guys", "Ur6nBVrs800": "they look so cute don't they so good hi guys welcome back today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i love hearing from you guys hope you have a wonderful day bye", "nozR-Bfa120": "hey this is Dom from Texas weed syndicate I'm gonna do a quick review of just CDs dried fruit today particularly apricot all the flavors are pretty good but this is one that I've tried and had the most experience with they come in at 250 milligram a 500 milligram 750 and a 1000 milligram package depending on what you want to get as far as dosage goes the one I liked was the 500 milligram it's about 14 milligrams per fruit so you know if you want a little bit higher dosage to describe two of them and you're good to go there's about 35 in here that you can you can have the price wise it runs 40 bucks for like a 500 milligram and then of course it goes up these are real nice if you want a real natural product that doesn't have a whole lot of additives it's just straight-up infused dry fruit with CBD so here's like what the apricots look like taste wise they taste just like dried fruit just like just like a dried apricot you wouldn't be able to tell the difference if there was CBD in this or not which is one of the reasons that I like them also comes and like a Kiwi chunk a mango a pineapple apple rings there's there's a few flavors out there that you can get these in a really really good product for anybody especially diabetics people like that that don't want a whole lot of sugar that's in gummies and other things that's a great product for for them and just about anybody that wants to do an edible alright thanks for watching you", "qCErqBYagjo": "[Music] what does that Brahma utopia is doing amazing travel

first time tuning in my name is Nikki welcome to my channel if you're an over-thinker like me you stress out all the time easily irritated pain and your neck in your back I highly suggest that you watch this I know that all of my videos so far have been about fashion but I want to share this product with you because it works if you haven't already done so please subscribe to my channel and hit the notification ball so that you can be alerted as soon as my new videos drop just as a disclaimer I was not compensated for any of these items anything that I say today is my personal opinion it's my review and I would never talk about something that I didn't like I used to be a really heavy smoker about 6 years ago and one day I just quit cold turkey and I never wanted to go back to it because I didn't want to have that feeling of being high or falling asleep or eating everything until my stomach hurt or just being unproductive that wasn't me it didn't want to go back to that and so why not try this all-natural product the product that I'm gonna be reviewing today is the wild CBD gummies I know I'm talking about wheat I never thought the day would come that I would even be doing some things that weed in it or be talking about a product but here I am and I'm talking about it because it's good wild CBD company spelled wyl D is based in Portland Oregon I went to Portland a few months ago and initially I was getting these because my mom does take CBD I know Portland Oregon is like known for greenery and they have a lot of recreational weed clubs and you know since weed has become legal in a lot of states I'm like ok I'm sure they have some gummies wild came up as a top-rated brand I bought one for myself and I was like oh these are pretty effective the CBD ratio was 20 to 1 so it did have a little bit of THC these are the strawberry ones and these were the ones that had the lowest dose of THC they did have other gummies that were like 1 to 1 ratio and I didn't want that because I don't want any VHC I don't want to feel drowsy I don't want to feel sleepy and so I feel like CBD is you know my preference it's just what I need I know some people can function off you know smoking a blonde I can't do that like you know if I'm sober that's when I'm the most productive let's talk about the CBD gummies I want to go down the line they have lemon raspberry blackberry and huckleberry lots of berries all the flavors aren't really good I've tried all of them the strawberry one with THC does have an aftertaste but it's not as bad I feel like these gummies are the version of adult Flintstone vitamins and I say that because this is so good if I could describe the feeling of this if I'm super super stressed I take a low very very low micro dose of this and you know I'm smooth sailing so the first flavor that I want to share with you guys is the lemon a real fruit infused gummies so in each container there's twenty gummies it's 500 milligrams as a nonsmoker and because I've only started using this a few months ago I'm gonna tell you my dosage and you might laugh and I open up the lemon flavored and I want to show you guys what it looks like it's just a little rectangle shape with sugar coated on it they all have sugar coated on it and this one of these gummies is 25 milligrams of CBD I don't know for some people it just depends on your preference of how much you want a cake I really had to adjust to figure out what was the best dosage for me what I recommend may not be for somebody else you might need more you might need less well I don't think you need less because my recommended dosage is way less I'm gonna try the gummies one by one so I can explain to you the taste and the texture and what to expect for one gummy I do cut it in eight pieces yes 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy to a nonsmoker is a lot and I take a piece every couple hours I don't take it every day but I do take it in situations like right now I'm recording and you know times I get nervous and I can't talk when I turn the camera on I just freeze like a deer in headlights and I don't like that from Anna stressful situation I'm just not having like you know the best day or I'm just crying all day and I can't control it I can't you know I don't have any power over it because my brain is you know scrambling all these thoughts in my head all I have to do is take an eighth of this literally takes away all your stress I don't know the effects of if you were to take a bigger dose maybe it might last for longer but what works for me last up to three hours and really like that's all I need so I'm gonna taste the lemon I just cut a small piece because I'm gonna try all of them and I don't want to be over relaxed I'm gonna let you guys know what it tastes like so you know what to expect the lemon one has a bit of an aftertaste but it's not that bad the strawberry one with the THC is stronger have a real gummy texture like gummy bears but this one I would say it's like a gummy gel so it melts in your mouth I would still classify it as a gummy but it just doesn't have that chewy consistency let's move on to the next one raspberry I'm gonna be high as when I'm done doing this for you guys I like the raspberry one it's really sweet and it does not have an aftertaste which I like it's a little tart it's a little sour but it's also really sweet love it next we have the blackberry I really love these gummies that's why I bought so many I want to share with you guys a promo code and I really highly recommend if you want to try them to get on it now cuz I don't know how long the sale is gonna last and it's cool that you can stack the sale price with the coupon code I wish that it was on sale when I bought it cuz it wasn't this is the blackberry blackberry tastes exactly like grape jelly mmm yum I don't know which one I like now because I like sour tart things so I do like the raspberry but this just tastes like identical to grape jelly so yeah last flavor that I want to share with you guys is the huckleberry it tastes like a sweet blueberry and you know blueberries aren't sweet this has an aftertaste I think out of all four of them this has the strongest aftertaste there's nothing wrong with it but I mean if you're picky and your palate is like in its bitter than it's not for you I wanted to get the variety pack just to see which one I liked best it was also less expensive for one of these bottles by itself it's 3995 I never even knew a day would come that I would buy or pay for weed or like a weed product I've never paid for weed of course there are some people out there that are just anti weed when I quit smoking six years ago I was anti weed my cousin was the one who was like you should try you don't have anything to lose if you don't like the feeling then don't do it again I'm glad that I listened to him because it really helped me it helped me to bring down my stress levels tremendously I know that there are a lot of benefits for CBD it helps you fall asleep helps you with anxiety depression and it helps you be more social in settings where there are a lot of people it helps some people concentrate more it helps me concentrate more it helps with a lot of diseases cancer chronic pain it just regulates your mood and I feel like I wanted to share this with you guys because I think it could help somebody if this product could help me with my stress I think it can help you too that's it that's all that I have to share with you guys about the wild CBD gummies if you have any questions if there's anything that I missed please let me know in the comment section below I would be happy to answer any of your questions now before I go I do have some questions for you is there

clicking on the videos right now i want to give a huge shout out to candy candy so who's candy candy if you're interested in finding out who watch the rest of the video like comment subscribe [Music] so hi c-man thank you for your support a little bit about us we are small but growing business in the cbd industry owned by a woman of minority and partnered with my beloved who believed in our journey let our gummies be the testimony smiley face sincerely grateful can of candy colin and chris so they sent me a week's supply of gummies and assortment of flavors we got a little bitty gummies sweet gummies multiple flavored gummies gummy bears gummy rounds so let's see how this goes day one so is this can of candy cbd gummies 500 milligrams derived from him and they even got the nutritional facts on the back that's different let's go off with this one i think i don't know it smells peachy it's peachy let's have a peachy day all right day one friday start off with a peach [Music] okay so today was the first day went to work had a real good day at work not gonna say necessarily it was the effect of it but it could be i noticed a big difference that's all i'm saying i almost forgot to say the flavor that i had today was the peach flavor i'm not a big fan on the peach flavors but it was still good point is i like it okay now i'm gonna go to bed [Music] all right it's time for work so we can pull out a magic bag let's go to clear one cbd gummies can of candies can i just have more than one and really i'm glad that cbd has been legalized because it's an option to take and it's a it's an all-natural option it's okay something y'all didn't know because like especially me i didn't know how cbd became legal and when it became legal well i guess in 2018 the agriculture improvement act aka the farm bill legalized cbd that is derived from hemp and contains no more than 0.3 of thc and if you want to know a little bit more the 867 billion reconciled farm bill was passed by senate on december 11 2018 and by the house on december 12th on december 20th it received prison donald trump's signature and became law and again in its natural way helps out with anxiety inflammation and all sorts of other things people use it for cancer people use it for pain and this is natural form of medication that god put on here on this earth for both you and me so yeah that's a little little backstory for you let's see how today goes yeah i slept pretty good too yeah oh my god today today was a busy day it was a busy busy day like like the restaurant was packed i had no mess-ups okay that's all i'm saying i had no mess up cbd did what it's supposed to do you know so like ice cube said today was a good day it's day two down in the books [Music] day three starter today not too good plus my vikings lost gotta go to work here in an hour so cbd be like calgon take me away all right today's going on day four so yesterday i said before i took this was that i wasn't having a good day right and i wasn't everything that i was feeling and thinking was like not that good so i took one of the bigger rounds right and when i took one of the bigger rounds it was like having a stronger effect it was like it felt like one of those electric glow balls you know where you touch around and all this electricity like going out from from the inside towards your hands i was trying to spark good vibrations i'm thinking i don't know if you knew what that was specifically leave a comment down below why i was like getting these uh electric volts or i sort of felt like it was just like working extra hard cbd day four let's go let's try some cherries it's my day off too these chair ones are chewy extra chewy it feels like also i forgot to say i took a regular gummy bear to go to sleep i don't wake up and i'm not as reckless in my sleep all right see how there it goes [Music] yesterday was day five i took a full dose needed it all the other employees and customers all the customers were like bugging needed to keep it under control up in here another job so thank you cbd it's another day let's go with this so being able to use cbd a consistent amount of days has like really helped me get my anxiety under control because i'm an individual who kind of runs high on anxiety if you know anything about what it is to be an infj or what it is to be a virgo we are always in our heads and so because we are always in our head we're always thinking about what we're thinking about and being that our mind is that way anxiety is hard to avoid so when cbd and specifically this cbd came at the time that it was really able to help me control my anxiety again not to say my anxiety was out of control but it was just in the times that was going on in my life um my anxiety was kind of getting the best of me and just for the fact that i was off cbd for a few weeks it was a good time like i'm saying keep on repeating that but it was a good time today is day six [Music] so you'll find on the website canon county says we are here to provide our customers quality products that not only supply the benefits of cbd but an uncompromising level of flavorful treats so i'm here to put my name on the line and support and saying yes you are achieving your mission this flavorful the cbd works and i enjoyed the fu so again i want to say thank you candy candy for coming through when you did and giving me the opportunity to review your product and consider me being one of the people to give a review all right but thank you for clicking on the video this has been simon vlaga with the cbd from candy candy review appreciate y'all for watching and i'm out here in three two one peace out my nieces", "72B_zNI1EJg": "[Music] hello friends how are you all doing today I hope you guys are staying healthy and well taking care of yourselves eating healthy foods taking vitamin C washing your hands so today I wanted to bring a video to you guys and in this video I'm gonna be giving an honest review on not pot CBD gummies so this company is based in Los Angeles and their products are vegan drug free so you're not going to be getting a high that you would with THC they're made in the USA there is nothing artificial no artificial flavors colors dyes nothing like that which is excellent they partnered with top scientists to innovate the world's chillest CBD gummy is I'm very impressed and I'll get into that in just a moment so yeah without all the sketchy stuff there's nothing fake nothing artificial because when we consume things we definitely don't want to have sketchy things in our body so there's another really cool aspect to this company and I'm going to be reading a little bit about it just to get to give you guys a little bit of a background because when you purchase things like this you want to know a little bit more about it so not pot we believe cannabis legalization is a step in the right direction keep in mind this is from cannabis oil it is not THC like I said you will not get high however I'm going to read a little bit about the company so bear with me and then we'll get into the review so not pot we believe full cannabis legalization is a step in the right direction but it's not enough to correct the wrongs of our criminal justice system that's why we're proud to announce that not pot bail fund a self-funded organization designed to combat mass incarceration one human being at a time so our contribution to the ecosystem is straightforward through our networks of partners we help pay for someone's bail every single month while seemingly simple we believe that paying even one person's bail represents a bigger act of resistance against criminal injustice although we can't claim to be able to reform the criminal justice system overnight it's complex sensitive and years of racial and gender bias this is so true we look forward to the future in which policies are led by compassion and health instead of social or political agendas until then let's get to work Katy the founder and the CEO of this company basically what they're talking about is for people who have been arrested or fined or put in jail for seat not CBD excuse me for THC for pot for weed crazy right because we have a lot more things to be concerned about in this world than someone having pot so if you guys haven't watched my channel before you know I'm very Pro cannabis Pro CBD Pro THC it's something that has a lot of benefits mentally and sometimes spiritually for me as well and also medically you know for people who are going through chemo or other health problems it can help them with you know if they don't have an appetite and they're under undergoing certain health procedures it helps you have the munchies or helps you have an appetite but like I said this is not tht this is just CBD so you will get the effects of a nice relaxing you might feel a little sleepy I use it for because I have insomnia so I use these for insomnia and for anxiety and they are amazing so let's just let's jump right into this review so I got these today they were fairly quick getting here just a typical you know you order them and I think it was like a week maybe a little bit sooner than that they were very quick and I was very pleased so I ordered the ripe and juicy watermelon flavor I ordered the pineapple tropical vacation I ordered the green apple crisp and sweet tart so I ordered those three they have other two flavors they have grape and then they have like a blue slushy flavor which looked fantastic but those sold out pretty quickly so these were the ones that I decided to get and they also gave you the really cute stickers says self-love not popped free plants and people [ __ ] Big Pharma not pot legal self-care chill as [ __ ] not pot so that was a fun little bonus that we got so these taste amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing they are so chewy they're the type of gummies that you chew and it's like not like like you're chewing really hard but they're soft and delicious and they're so good so so good all of them are amazing this suggested use is to take one gummy per day and give yourself a hug I'm reading it directly off the bottle so like I said in my previous CBD videos I wonder I want to emphasize that everybody is different some people might take more there's nothing wrong with that but they're suggested use is to take one gummy per day so this can also help with anxiety and other things like that so I am very pleased I'm very very happy that I purchased these because I have to say they are probably I and I with just CBD I did a review on those gummies as well and that company and I'm gonna link that below in the description box you guys can check that out as well but I highly recommend these I will leave the link to the website in my description box and if you guys are stressed out or having anxiety because of all this coronavirus stuff I highly recommend these and you know what I'm not sponsored for this video it would be amazing if I was but I'm not sponsored I do have another CBD video coming up and I'm not sponsored for that either but they did reach out to me and they wanted to have me review their products so I still haven't received those products yet it's a little bit slower so that's I just have to be patient I suppose and I'm not sure if maybe the company's a little bit slower maybe because they have higher orders or other precautions they have to follow but I am very pleased with this product not pot because it is not pot it is CBD and I just wanted to share with you guys so I hope you have a wonderful day continue to take care of each other and I will see you guys in the next video", "wsjRME4Hjrk": "[Music] don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody welcome back you work berber cannabis in today's video i want to be showing you how i infuse our gummy recipe but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to the channel please consider subscribing and if you've already subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind give the video a big thumbs up so folks today I'm gonna be running through a lot of the ways you can infuse our gummy recipe that which we just posted at the same time as this video now the reason being is I want to make sure that that gummy recipe stays by itself and that I'll show you where along the line you could infuse that with that being said guys there are so many different ways to infuse this gummy recipe so I'm gonna take you through my favorite way and then bring you all the way to my least favorite way and I'll kind of explain why one is better than the other at least in my eyes so let's get right into it let me show you how I infuse our gummy recipe alright folks so now we're gonna talk about how I infuse our gummy recipe so first and foremost a couple of the things that I will be using you can find on Amazon and I'll leave all that information in the description below so hopefully you can check it out if you guys are interested in any type of flour or Keith don't forget you can always email me and that will be in the description below also so today folks we're going to talk about my favorite way to add CBD to our Gumby recipe and that is with Keef now this is a premium product for the cannabis plant you have to extract it whether it's dry extraction you can wet extract it although it's a lot more time consuming but you can go ahead and check out our video on how to extract Keef but this is by far my favorite way to add Keef to that gummy recipe now it has to be d carved and typically what I like to do is use 1 to 2 grams depending on how potent you want it and UD kharbut for approximately 15 minutes on two hundred and fifty degrees in your oven now the one downside to using Keith in the raw form and just adding it to the gummy recipe is that it will float to the surface and it kind of creates a weird surface on the gummy it's nothing you can't taste it really but it does create that weird textured surface only on one side of the gum the other side is perfectly fine and of course guys when I talk about infusing the recipe I'm gonna tell you exactly when to infuse it now this goes for everything that I'm going to show you today but the number one time the best time to infuse the gummy recipe is after the blooming stage so you were looking at our gummy recipe it's it's at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes and then we start to heat it up during that heating up process that is when you would add the key for any of these other things that I'm gonna go over so one of the ways I found that you could get rid of that texture in the gummy recipe if you use Keith is you can use sunflower lecithin or vegetable glycerin now when it comes to using these two things it doesn't really affect the recipe too much but it will dissolve the kief and the way you do it is you use about two tablespoons you put it in a little bowl like this you add all your ingredients you add your one to two grams of d carb Keith you mix it around as best you can try to dissolve it and then again you add that during the heating up process on the stove and you let it mix in and you continue to continuously mix it so this is by far my favorite way just adding raw keef I like to keep it on natural the texture does not bother me but if you want it like a store-bought gummy you're gonna have to use one of these two things I actually prefer the glycerin for the gummy recipe over the lesson but the lesson is well known for absorption so either one of these will work guys it's just your personal preference and what you like I know some people have a little bit of an allergy to vegetable glycerin not a lot of them but some do and so they go with less certain I I do not like the soil a certain I go with the liquid sunflower less it's in you can get granular but I don't really see the point in the granular for this process so definitely get the liquid less certain so that's that and using Keef and how and how I use Keef in the recipe the next thing I'm going to show you is an efficient way to add CBD to our recipe but it is not my favorite way by any means it gives a harsh flavor and honestly guys it's a little dangerous and you got to know what you're doing with this stuff and if you guys haven't checked it out yet go ahead and please do so on our how to make a CBD tincture recipe you can find that in the description below but here folks is our alcohol tincture now for this you will use a half a cup and you will cook it down on the stove and when you're cooking it down on the stove it becomes kind of pasty towards the end what you're doing is you're cooking off the alcohol because you don't want to really be making alcohol gummies and so once you do that you again you add it during the heating up process when making those gummies now when you add either is the key for the alcohol tincture when you're heating up that gelatin you want to really mix it in just really mix it in get it three to four or five minutes whatever it takes there's no rush just make sure you don't burn the gelatin keep it at a medium low temperature and just make sure that it's getting mixed in but I'm not even going to show you this today guys because I just do not like using this I did it at home I do not recommend it it's not my favorite way to do this at all so I will refer you to our friends over at the magical butter machine if you want to learn how to cook down your tincture but again guys you need a pan need on low temperature on a stovetop preferably electric folks and if you can do it outside it's best to do it outside the fumes are rough on the smell and it's just a really harsh way to do it but this is an efficient way to add CBD to our gummie recipe now these are the two ways that I really do not like it changes the entire texture of the gummy and it changes the flavor of the gummy and it gives it like this weird oily flavor and so folks you can use MCT or olive oil that's been infused already with CBD or you can use coconut oil and you're also adding about two to three tablespoons of coconut oil or MCT oil to the gelatin recipe you can add more if you want again that really depends on what you like and how strong you want it now here's the problem with using oil it changes the entire texture of the gummy it tends to float around and make it weird it also comes with a very similar harsh taste that the alcohol tincture has not as harsh and definitely a lot safer to use but the gummy itself it just doesn't look good and it doesn't really taste that good it's just not a great way to add it but however you can do it but it's just not the way I recommend it and again I'm gonna go back to D carb Keef and the lesson or glycerin if you want the nice looking gummy but you can just add straight Keith it's just the safest way to go folks and again if you are interested in Keith or flour to make your own at home feel free to email me that information will be in the description below

for me at my home and I hope it works for you guys too and that's all I have for today folks I hope you enjoyed today's video and as always take care and I will see you in another video", "HMcaV3V8Z1U": "warning the views expressed in this video are not necessarily the views or opinions of the sponsors i am not a doctor or a lawyer always consult experts when making medical decisions i am a legal licensed medical marijuana patient in my state this is an educational video intended for viewers that are 18 or older in today's video we are going to be talking about delta 8 thc specifically hemp derived delta 8 thc is it really legal does it really get you medicated what's the difference between delta 8 and delta 9. i'm going to tell you everything i think that you should know about delta 8 in this video stay tuned [Music] good morning everybody my name is nate and this is nate on cannabis and today we are talking about delta eight i am sure by now you have heard of delta eight over the last six months or so i've seen it everywhere all over the internet and to be honest i've been extremely skeptical i have a lot of history with hemp products and while i do love full spectrum cbd oils and full spectrum hemp products there is a lot of snake oil salesmen out there when it comes to cbd not all cbd and hint products are created equal and even the really good hemp products that i found and there are quite a few while some do a very good job of relaxing you and relieving stress and anxiety none of them get you stoned none of them get you any kind of inebriation there is no intoxicating effect with any hemp product that i've ever tried that is until now i finally broke down and tried some delta eight thc hemp derived delta a thc and my experience was very surprising as a matter of fact the first time i tried these so these are 25 milligrams a piece right i was so skeptical about getting stoned off of a hemp product that i took three of them my normal dose from delta 9 thc is about 20 milligrams that is personally where i like to be i took 75 milligrams of delta 8 and boy howdy there is not a whole lot of difference between these gummies and the gummies that you would get at a dispensary there's a few differences and we're going to talk about it but before we get into the video i have to show a little bit of sponsor love this video is brought to you by elevate holistics elevate holistics is a telehealth clinic offering medical marijuana recommendations right here in missouri and if you need your medical marijuana card and click the link in the description you can get your medical marijuana card for just 75 now that is an affiliate link but i do not get paid if you click that link and sign up elevate holistics is a sponsor on the channel already i already got their money but if you use that link in the description it will save you fifty dollars off the normal 125 card which means you can get it for 75 dollars and saves you a little bit of money so shout out to elevate holistics link in the description all right back to delta eight so so i was talking to the manager of cassfield dispensary a while back charlie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite people now she knows that i suffer from an anxiety disorder and because of that i'm a big fan of edibles gummies they are longer lasting i don't have to medicate every 30 to 45 minutes to keep my anxiety in check i can take one dose now and go off to the depths of walmart which if you have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is insane if you don't have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is probably almost equally as insane so i'm a huge fan of gummies but she has suggested that i try delta eight because gummies are kind of expensive and i'm not always a big fan of being so medicated that you can't function sometimes that's fun i enjoy it occasionally but most of the time i need to find some kind of relief to keep my anxiety and my panic in check so that i can go out into the world and function as a normal human being so i got some of these delta eight gummies from native hemp and then shortly after i got these i was sent some delta eight gummies from top shelf hemp now this has been about two weeks and i've had a chance to really dive into them so what is delta eight thc well it is not much different than delta nine thc which you should already be accustomed to if you consume cannabis or are a medical marijuana patient here in missouri delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the molecular compound that gives us the intoxicating effect when we consume cannabis right so when we smoke or vape it it gives us that intoxicating effect when we eat it in an edible or consume it our liver turns that delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol into 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol which is a complete different compound of itself which gives us a more inebriating effect it lasts longer when you take inedible it's a little bit stronger it doesn't take as much to get you where you need to be so there are already different types of thc that you should be aware of delta 8 is another one now delta 8 is naturally occurring it naturally occurs in cannabis and it is derived from hemp hemp is just a legal definition for marijuana that has less than 0.3 thc in it so all of the delta 8 on the shelves that are being sold in stores is hemp derived it comes from plants with low delta 9 thc and actually low delta 8 thc delta 8 doesn't really grow in abundance in any plant whether it be hemp or marijuana they actually extract it by isolating and extracting cbd and once that cbd is isolated they use a process that includes acids they actually convert that cannabidiol into delta a thc so it comes out cbd then they turn it into delta eight thc and then put it back into products so they cook it into edibles or they put it into a mixture and spray it onto hemp flour or turn it into a distill it into a concentrate like delta eight dabs or delta eight vape carts and because they derive it from actual hemp legally grown him and because delta 8 is not delta 9 it's being sold all across the country but how legal is it actually is it going to stay legal what if you want to sell delta 8 gummies should you be concerned if you possess delta 8 gummies and you're not a medical marijuana patient should you be concerned well to give you a little bit more information on the legality of delta 8 here is matt gunther with the american cannabinoid association congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill you can expect delta 8 products to remain legal till at least 2022. now will the federal government change the farm act that remains to be seen that's if we don't see federal legalization of marijuana between now and then which is still kind of what about urine tests what if you work a job where you're kind of afraid to become a medical marijuana patient because you don't want to fail a urine test or maybe you're on probation and parole and you think well i'm going to take some of these delta 8 hemp gummies that way i don't fail on that urine test when my po pops me are you gonna drop hot the answer is yes you are probably going to drop hot you are going to fail your analysis test if you are taking these gummies because even though its delta hthc going in once your body metabolizes that delta eight once your body metabolizes thc in general it all comes out the same most panel tests are testing for thc metabolites so delta 8 delta 9 doesn't matter what's going in it's all coming out the same so if this is something you're using to get by on that account you might want to rethink your strategy people say that it is the same high without the paranoia or anxiety that some people get from taking edibles or overdoing it when they take edibles it does seem to be a less intense experience so if you are a new patient that wants to try edibles maybe you have a medical marijuana card but you haven't tried any of the brands that are out there yet because you've heard the horror stories of people calling 9-1-1 because they thought they were going to die in some cases they thought they already were dead no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies and once he and his wife were full and high they thought they'd overdosed and called 9-1-1 i think i'm having an overdose of this still as my wife overdose of what marijuana i don't know if they had something in it can you please send rescue did you guys have fever or anything no i'm just i think we're dying how much did you guys have i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead time is going by really really really really slow well instead of being charged parallel sorry instead of being charged the police department let the officer resign his wife was not charged either so far police officials have not commented on the case now how do you follow a story like that those are funny stories but they can be scary so if you're worried about having an experience like that delta 8 is a good intro into it for me personally i started taking delta 8 because i can't afford dispensary prices all the time i just can't most people probably can't either delta 8 is about half the price of delta 9 thc it's actually a little bit less depending on where you get it these 250 milligram packages of native hemp delta 8 are actually only about 25 and if you pick them up at cass fill dispensary you can get them on sale right now for 19 so if you are looking for a good intro into edibles delta 8 is a good place to start in my opinion or if you're like me and just can't afford to hit the dispensary all the time delta a really gets me through in between those dispensary runs or caregiver drops delta 8 is a good replacement or if edibles tend to give you over anxiety or panic attacks like they do some people then delta a might be something that you want to look into for that because it is it is less intense i feel less anxiety less paranoia all of that that they used to advertise delta 8 i truly experienced just at a less potency than you normally would feel so just to recap delta 8 is hemp derived thc it is made from converting cbd into delta a thc it is 100 legal for now it will make you drop on a urine test so if you're on probation parole or you're in a job or that's a problem i wouldn't recommend using this or any other cannabis products but they do work and they do work as described as always this is a subjective opinion this is my personal experience so let me know in the comments have you tried delta 8 products what did you think about it i am becoming a huge fan and with the current price of edibles at the dispensaries these may be my new go-to for quite some time as always thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video give me a like comment or subscribe it really helps me out and if you like the hoodie you can find it on my website cured.tv shop thanks for watching", "Z7vhm82e-WI": "hi this is Stacey - lemy from the complete herbal guide I work with a lot of different CBD companies and a lot of them send me different products to try I'm not required to make videos about them or talk about them but when I have a product that I really like I like to share it with the public and let you know my thoughts this is nature script CBD gummies I've been using them for the last three months and I just wanted to talk a little about what I thought about them they're very small and they're very easy to chew and each time I take it after a few minutes I feel a change I feel a sense of calmness a relaxation feeling and a feeling where I can focus a little bit better because I'm not as tense and my mind is not going rapid trying to think what's the next thing to do what do I have to do tomorrow because a lot of times for me I'm always constantly doing things so even when I go to bed at night when I'm getting ready to go to sleep my mind is still going of all different things I have to do so when I do CBD at night it tends to make me more calm more relaxed and more focused and I'm able to actually go to bed and not think as much I'm actually able to close my eyes relax and actually have a good night's sleep now at nature Script CBD I felt I've tried many others and I felt that this one was very strong it actually worked a lot it felt I felt a lot more calm more on this than I did on other CBD gummybear brands now with the taste some people like a sweet taste some people you know don't care for the for this week they like the sour patch type feeling the sour kind of tastes with nature Script CBD gummies they have more of a sour taste to them if you like sour patches then you'll definitely like these these gummy bears for me I tend to like things that aren't as sweet I mean not as sour and they like things that have more of a sweet taste so for me it works really well I liked it because it worked really well but I actually for using a CBD oil because the CBD oil actually you don't taste the sourness you don't taste anything it just goes straight down but the gummy bears work just as well they're very good and I actually I actually didn't have to eat more than one I had one and it did the trick we're with the CBD oil I had to take more of it to actually get that feeling and I've got this sense of calmness now what CBD you have to remember that every company uses different types of the leaf there's different strands there's over a hundred components in the marijuana leaf different companies make hemp they make CBD you can get THC from the marijuana leaf and all these different things in the marijuana leaf work on your brain differently they change the different thinking components in your brain and that's what causes the reaction of feeling more focused feeling more relaxed helping chronic pain you don't feel as much trouble chronic pain because the CBD in the hemp controls different parts of the brain and helps you feel these feelings that we feel after we use CBD now for me my preference with a CBD oil but I really do like them if you like sour patches then you're gonna love CBD gummies because it it gives you a great effect it gives you a great sense of calmness and it works really well so I just wanted to let you know my thoughts about it and I would love for you to share your comments if you tried gummy bears please tell me and tell me your thoughts about it and if you tried CBD oil tell me what you thought and if you tried both of them let me know which one you like better I'd love to hear from everybody and the people who listen to the videos would love to hear what you guys think because with your input and your comments we actually can get a lot out of each other's knowledge because working together and learn about it it's a great thing because there's so much information out there it's a overload of information about CBD and it's hard to really realize what's right what's wrong what's true and what's not but when people try it and they give their honest opinion then it helps us decide what's better for us so thank you so much for listening to my video I really appreciate your time and I hope that you listen to more of my videos as I try different products and I try different things and I let you know how I feel and I look forward to your comments this is Stacey - lemy

thank you guys bye", "Pbsr-PgGvVk": "sleeeeep everyone knows we need it yet for some it remains so elusive the condition where one is dissatisfied with the quantity or quality of their sleep is called insomnia and it can have many causes and the problem is widespread as one in four Americans experiences its amia at some point each year and 60 million Americans are suffering from chronic sleep difficulty perhaps you've heard that CBD oil may be able to help with insomnia well I'm dr. Lynn Murray more ski with octagon Biolabs I'm gonna provide some information on how CBD can play a role in getting you a better night's sleep let's start by discussing what causes insomnia for some it's poor sleep habits like not maintaining a regular sleep schedule or staring at the blue light from your phone while your body is trying to wind down but for others insomnia can be due to conditions like anxiety and in others it may not have any identifiable cause whatsoever insomnia is so common that several pharmaceuticals have been created to help people with sleep however many of these medications come with serious side effects luckily research has shown that CBD a natural substance can significantly help improve sleep without these side effects CBD or cannabidiol is one of the compounds found in cannabis it's different from the compound THC which is the substance responsible for the high commonly associated with marijuana CBD you won't get you high but it has some of the same properties that can have significantly positive impacts on your sleep scientists have found that taking CBD can increase the total amount of sleep and also decrease the number of time subjects woke up in the middle of the night how does it work well CBD acts on a type of receptor in the brain called 5h t1a these receptors trigger the release and reuptake of serotonin serotonin is a precursor to melatonin which regulates the sleep/wake cycle through its actions on the 5ht 1 a receptor CBD can increase serotonin levels thereby resulting in higher levels of melatonin and as a result improve sleep in fact one of the few side effects CBD users have noticed if they take too much is some increased sleepiness on the other hand most prescription sleep medications act on the gaba receptors in the brain which control our levels of alertness these medications have side effects ranging from memory disturbances to hallucinations to sleepwalking so what kind of CBD oil should you be using to try to improve your sleep and how much should you use well let's start with the type of CBD oil CBD oil can be extracted from hemp plants or marijuana plants the difference is that the CBD extracted from hemp has little to no THC in it aside from being the component in marijuana that causes the high THC when taken over a long period of time can have negative effects on the circadian rhythm cause delays in sleep onset and lead to daytime sleepiness that's why it's important to ensure that if you're taking CBD for sleep you aim to get CBD that has zero THC in it a good CBD oil will have the percentage of THC written on the label so you can make an informed purchase now as for how much CBD you should take there are some guidelines but your experience may vary as everyone absorbs CBD differently based on their metabolism and their size among other factors however studies have found some common patterns among CBD dosing in regards to how effective it can be for insomnia for example they actually found that low-dose CBD can negatively impact sleep while mid-range and high dose CBD positively affects sleep in a study where subjects were given different doses from 40 milligrams to 160 milligrams 160 milligrams dose was the one found to increase sleep duration and quality so while I usually suggest starting low and going slow in regards to figuring out what dose of CBD works for you in this instance you may want to start with a slightly higher dose because it turns out that in the studies the most common side effect was sleepiness which may be just the thing you're going for so if you overshoot the side effect may be exactly what you're seeking before starting a CBD regimen for insomnia please consult with your personal physician especially if you're on prescription drugs pregnant breastfeeding or have any other current medical conditions in addition if you are currently taking prescription medications for your insomnia please do not discontinue use without physician supervision if you have gotten better sleep using CBD please share your experience with us please like and subscribe for the most up-to-date CBD information and if you'd like more

sorry guys shit's been crazy man and if you follow me on xbox are you I told you guys I was gonna be making a video soon and Here I am making up and down so it's good I'm just gonna jump into it since I last made a video so I apologize I'm making a video sooner it's been working gravy changes to myself you know going through my own thing got a new tattoo so I mean you know everything's been like up and down the road you know like those so what I'm going to talk about today is something completely different I have never talked about the hoe into our life it's about anxiety and depression and PTSD so if you or a loved one is one of those people who suffer from anxiety and and depression or PTSD whatever it is I think I have a solution for you and not many people speak about it or people are afraid to talk about it but I'm not I've been having some crazies I need some tums for like the past four months and I thought I was having a heart attack so I was in the hospital and out of the hospital well turns out that's just anxiety and still to this day I am struggling with how to deal with it but instead of taking medication from the doctor I chose to go a different route and it works it's called TVD cannabis oil its THC 3 which is the good thing you don't have to feel the high that people nowadays are looking for I don't like that Oh so I figured hey why not try CBD because it's a calming effect on your body it motivates you takes away the pains that you get from like muscle pains or back pains whatever it may be I get really bad chest pains constantly and one of the biggest things for me was to try to overcome those chest pains try to overcome the anxiety and cope with it and it just it's been a struggle I mean I'm sure a lot of people out there can relate I normally don't make videos of this or put myself out there but I feel as if you know what helps me may be able to help one of you guys and if I can share that and if I can make somebody else easier than I'm going to do that so I'm gonna go over some of the products that I've been using for like the past week that seemed to really help for me I'm starting to see like a major change in myself from like being anxious over the place and like poppity and to like really relaxed and just super calm I'm more motivated I don't have a problem getting up in the morning and going to work and doing what I have to do coming back home and spending time you know with my family and stuff like that so I'm just gonna jump right into it and I hope you guys like the video if you have any questions comments concerns comment down below and you have it already please subscribe to my youtube channel I know it's been a really long time since I last made a video but I'm going to try to make more videos more frequently now that I have a little bit more free time Halloween's next week so I'm pretty excited about that and let's go ahead and get started okay so here's the product it's a whole CBD THC free the promise even size on the back of the label there's one of the bags if you guys can see that you can read right here it says medical use you can even if you have a QR scanner you can scan that right there so you can make up the left results it's pretty cool always like to see what I'm eating so this is CBD in huge squares you take two of these and you're like sleeping in the couch I'm not even kidding I tip to the other day my shoulder was hurting like really it puts on my CBD cream and two hours later I woke up and there's like I had the best map of my life and I felt so refreshed when I woke up my shoulder pain was gone and it came back later that night but for the meantime it was gone so it definitely helped I definitely noticed that it was something um so this is this is 12 pieces it's 25 milligrams each which is I guess you could say medium it's not that high there was higher dosage as I believe - too familiar with CBD but I'm learning that it does work and I will vouch for it it's lab tested its full-spectrum infused CBD gummies the company that makes this I believe a snack scene actually makes it again its THC free [Music] ingredients are corn syrup sugar corn starch beef gelatin CBD acidity regulator citric acid artificial flavors and blue color so it's just deleted by BIOS they I think that's how you pronounce excuse me if I'm pronouncing it wrong but you can go to WWE on I will put it down into the link after this video you guys can check it out if people want you so that's the first one I have I take these at night because they make me super tired and really like 15-20 minutes later I'm like Ashley buddy went to bed sleep I'm not complaining because I laugh and sleep sometimes I don't know if you guys can relate but like sometimes I Dawson turn I'm like feeling like I'm sleeping then I wake up and it's like man I'm not really something or like sure I just get up and like not try to sleep or whatever so these I use at nighttime they come with 12 pieces it's the leather pack I think is I think it's six or eight these are really good the other one that I use is these ones it's the same thing it's the ass let's see video I really hope I'm saying that right I am so sorry if I'm not saying that correctly it's 500 milligrams I was told that each of these gummies and we had like five milligrams DVD in it so they look like I use these I use these like all day obviously like if I'm feeling like if I'm getting chest pains or the time having like really bad anxiety or I'm going to the store and my social anxiety is like like try to hide you know but I gotta get [ __ ] done so I have to go to the store so I take like one of these before going to the store or you know throughout the day and it helps me so these ones are by the same people buy advice faith it says consume more no more than two pieces every six hours must be 18 and over to purchase this product so again if I have any young viewers this is a 18 plus only channel and this is for 18 plus only people yeah so that's the other one these ones I'm pissed anymore so I'm kind of low-key mad at myself I didn't pick more of these up I went to the store that I got these from they were like $4.99 a pack and literally should have just like cashed out and been like here's 100 bucks give me what you have these are awesome it's a hundred milligrams by the same company these gummy bears are freaking good there was blue ones in there but I kind of ate the blue ones first they're ten milligrams each / gummy you get about like 10 or 11 the big a v12 doesn't you know I really bad anxiety so they admit they hooked me I'll just get it you get what you get in the package I don't know them and it really comes in there but there was 12 in here when I got so again consume no more than 2 pieces every 6 hours its THC free ingredients or sugar corn syrup white grape juice gelatin CBD citric acid swirl all natural and artificial flavors carnauba wax and artificial colors red 4000 sexy I'll buy blue one I use these whenever sometimes I'll take one of these and I'll take one of these because this is 5 milligrams and this is 10 milligrams Bobby set calms you down I feel as if my anxiety it's been less since I've been eating these Cummings the cool thing about these is they're 100% legal probably in all 50 states I would imagine the only thing is it's gotta get these like evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration so that way everybody knows that it is a safe alternative and it does work you know like I said earlier the video and one Jew call myself out and say I have all these issues but I'm not the only person not the only one in her entire world who suffers from bad anxiety like I do who when they spend money their chest starts hurting that might be a little normal who doesn't want to leave the house because you know they isolate themselves so much that they didn't used to the fact of being alone is okay and honestly being alone is okay sometimes but you got to get out there and go to social apps and that's my biggest thing I have a huge problem socializing in the past couple months since I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and they also said I had PTSD it's been rough I kind of shut everybody out I go to work I come home and that's it y'all catch me on xbox sometimes game in on fortnight or Call of Duty whatever it is which you guys can add me I'll put my gamertag down below we gonna play some games but again I'm not gonna lie I have some other YouTube videos on my channel of me playing xbox so that's cool so anyways so those are these limbs they're clear bears so it took all I'm a cute little package okay last but not least this is its doctor formulated THC free all this is THC free 100% there's not even the slightest bit it's Stevie D 10 milligrams it's a dropper so there's all the information on the back those are the ingredients on that if you guys can see this okay so yeah that's the box so it's ordered straight at you guys formulated by David Perlmutter and the board-certified neurologist and fellow of the American College of nutrition I got this from a store called vitamin shop I don't know if any of you guys are aware you guys are located but if you're in Ohio you can find vitamin shop pretty much I guess everywhere not everywhere but you know frequently store friends so it's a lab door certified cheesy free tested non-gmo which is good it's hemp sustainably grown in the USA which is also good and its co2 solvent free extract it's vegan and gluten free and it tastes really natural I take but a dropper to maybe three in the morning to start my day that's the bottle so it comes like with a little dropper in the flavor is mint chocolate chip so all of you mint fans must be good for you they recommend the best to me to start off with there's another brand called Charlotte's Web it's pretty expensive I for just this I think it was like 27 28 blocks we all go over the prices for the other ones too I think I failed on that aspect I'm so sorry so it's a thirty milliliter bottle hold him extract liquid drops it has in charge of act blind in it you just feel good what's all this all of these products to be completely honest with you I would much rather spend money on something that I'm not going to die from or get addicted to because of the opioid crisis and the USA I pray for everybody out there who is struggling with opioids or you know other drug addictions I really hope you guys get the guidance in the help that you all need because there's a better life out there then drops you can go out with your friends and have fun and check a couple beers and not get screwed up by stuff that you shouldn't be putting in your body and it all falls back to I would rather a hundred and ten thousand percent take something natural like CBD than to take something subscribe to my adapter that you can get addicted to that you can overdose from there are so many overdoses in this world and it sucks a lot of young people are dropping like freaking flies you know and if you're watching this video and you're one of those people that struggle with any of that you know just know that you're not alone and if you need the help and want the help that go get it go get it be strong speak up do what you got to do dude you gotta do to survive because this world's gold nowadays but there's always hope at the end of the day always so I really hope that everybody takes this video as something to learn from or to you know just take advice from because I I struggle with really bad lighting and I'm likely depressed in those days and I've dried medications from doctors but they just don't work for me I'm not a pill person in fact I think the only pill I take every day is my allergy medicine and even then I have to remind myself to take that pill so CBD is my go chill may not be everybody's go-to everybody has a different way of handling things and that's fine I get it but anyways so I think do these maybe three drops in the morning it's really good it's very natural right underneath my tongue they're just like two or three jobs it's that broad spectrum hand that extract blends 947 milligrams probably in the whole bottle probably not per job so that brings down to God so bad at math so you guys can do the math you guys can figure it out probably comes down to I don't know so anyways it's got the in tragic blend a sense of organic peppermint flower leaf stem will a sense of organ experiment leaf which spearmint and peppermint is really good for a lot of things if you're one of those people who use essential oils like I do I'll probably be making as an essential oil video soon maybe maybe later I don't know if I would just post it tomorrow or something but it's a oils really helped for me too so let's see it also has a sense of organic orange which orange is really good for like headaches and stuff makes you overall hobby to see it's got a sense of organic laughs I didn't flower and stem which I'm assuming is lavender which lavender is like you know if you guys have anxiety and you know that Islanders like the number humming essential oil so they say you know and I agree I have a diffuser it's a blown glass when it's really pretty it's not like 15 different color shades and it's got like two different settings for the steam I put my lavender in there and it's like CBD and a couple hours and like passed out and go to bed and it's it really relaxes me and then it has a sense of organic frankincense resin oil which freaking sense is another one of those good essential oils for calming other ingredients are organic chocolate mint flavor and can change tree nuts so if you're allergic to peanuts or no it's then it's probably not going to be solvable change display okay so went over the droplets these ones you could find out vitamin shoppe I can try to put the link down below in the description where you could buy these I know

later", "JKoBqFQtobI": "[Music] hi guys welcome to or back to my channel my name is Emma and today's video is going to be on my experience with CBD if you don't know what CBD is it is basically the medicinal compound that is found in the marijuana plant I have had numerous experiences with it to be honest I feel like I'm the outlier here but my experiences have not been great a little bit about me and why I started using CBD is that I when I was younger I would say until I was 20 woman I had no health issues have no anxiety no depression I was very active very social very healthy life was good then in my early 20s I started developing some mental health issues and it really spiraled like completely out of control down the road I would say three years later it developed into chronic stomach pain the stomach pain that I experienced is severe and I experienced it daily my journey with CBD began in 2017 I had been curious about CBD for a long time I just was willing to try anything kind of my main purpose was to see if it would help my stomach pain in 2017 I tried to apply to get my medical marijuana license in Florida I ended up going to a doctor and she was kind of telling me about the CBD and how it was pure CBD it's not like the stuff that you can just buy at the gas station or at a vape shop or smoke shop down the road like there's a huge difference between those two things so I really wanted something pure something medicinal something that would actually be strong enough to affect my body and heal my body my application that ended up getting and so I couldn't get it then about three months later I decided I'm gonna move to California to get into a dispensary to get high quality CBD and not go to jail so I moved to California a very extreme person and spontaneous and I just do whatever I want there are other reasons why I moved to California too but that was a huge reason so I moved to California got into a dispensary I ended up getting CBD in like a little I don't know it's just like a little injector tube you just squeeze a drop on like under your tongue it was just pure straight CBD there was nothing else to add it to it the pain that I wanted it to help me with I don't even know how to describe it but I can feel everything going through my intestines it feels like hot knives slicing my stomach that was intense sorry but that's the truth and that's the pain that I am trying that I was trying to get some help with or some relief from and I just wanted something to help numb that a little bit or lessen the pain so I tried see that CBD that pure CBD I used up the whole tube for one did not help with any of the pain that I was experiencing and - it gave me really bad anxiety like it would give me anxiety attacks on my palms with sweat my heart would race I would basically feel high even though I didn't take enough to get high and I'm not supposed to get high on it but I would feel disoriented for sure that was my experience with that then my next experience with CBD was through my friend he hooked me up with some CBD pens there was this one day that I had severe like side pain it was almost like I had pulled a muscle or something I don't know what it was from but it wouldn't go away anytime I would breathe it would like pull that muscle and it just honestly hurt to exist I hadn't used the CBD pen yet that my friend gave me but I took like one puff of that within ten it's my side pain was completely gone so not my stomach pain but the one side pain was completely gone and that blew my mind I was with a friend at the time and I walked out into the kitchen where she was I was just like my pain is gone I had had that pain for probably a week and I've been taking turmeric tablets and like inflammation tablets and like all this stuff that you can think of and nothing was helping that helped so that was really really interesting tea break that was in 2018 fast forward to 2019 I tried new leaf naturals CBD and I just got the smallest bottle I ordered it online again I was just hoping for some stomach pain relief I also was experiencing slight while I would say straight up depression at the time so I was hoping that it might alleviate that somehow and so I tried it no noticeable benefits I don't think there were any bad experiences with that that I can remember I just remembered not experiencing anything I forgot about another experience I'm gonna tell you about it now I'm going to rewind a little bit because I forgot this story but in 2017 as well before I moved to California my cousin gave me this jar of CBD and I don't even know the brand I was like my first experience with CBD he said just it was kind of like a gel and he said just dip your pinkie into the gel and just like hold it under your tongue and it will dissolve he was like you don't need mind you just need a little bit so I just did a little bit the first day didn't experience anything the next day this kind of gets crazy I want to preface this by saying that I also was sent a pack of basically essential oil vapes the vape brand was monk and I probably took like one to two puffs of the essential oil bait then also took a little thing of the CBD about two hours later I basically had arrhythmia in my heart and it was like my heart stopped for a second and then it started beating really really fast it wouldn't stop and I couldn't get it to stop and I called the paramedics I was really lightheaded like trying to get outside like walking through my house like I could barely walk I was just in the complete daze because my heart was beating so fast and I was just so lightheaded and the paramedics came they were telling me to do all this stuff to try to slow my heart down and they were like oh it's probably just a panic attack it wasn't like they couldn't get my heart to slow down so they rushed me to the hospital when I got to the hospital they were trying to give me like all these things to slow my heart down and they couldn't get it to slow down they ended up diagnosing me with SVT which is supraventricular tachycardia a faster than normal heart rate beginning above the hearts to lower chambers supraventricular tachycardia is a rapid heartbeat that develops when the normal electrical impulses of the heart are disrupted so that happened I was probably in there for a day and a half with them just making sure that everything was okay my body was extremely weak for the whole following week I've got on a whole slew of anxiety thinking like is this gonna happen again am I gonna die am I gonna go back to the hospital so I can't for sure say that that was CVD related either way that's an experience that I had and I wanted to share it I can't believe I ever tried CVD that's with that now I'm gonna fast forward to the end of 2019 November ish I tried the brand Lazarus Naturals and I tried this brand because I was looking all over reddit to figure out which is the best brand which is the most pure CVD which brand have people had the best experience with which is the most affordable and all these things Lazarus won by a landslide new leaf had a lot of people talking about it but I had already tried that and it did nothing so I wanted to try something else so this time I went for Lazarus Naturals I just want to say like they're a great company first of all because they have a huge discount for Army veterans which is amazing they have a huge discount for people with chronic illness so you basically just have to send in your papers from your doctor to prove that you actually do have a chronic illness and they also have a discount for low income people that's amazing that they provide that for so many people and I the comments on their Instagram and a lot of people are saying that like it's worked miracles for them so I really appreciate that they do that just as a company so to get on to my experience with them I ordered I don't even know how many ounces it was but it was like this size not the smallest one but the next size up of the just regular unflavored CBD because I didn't want anything to taint it or meet me have a different experience than just what natural pure CBD would do I would take just a couple drops under the tongue for the first week I would say I didn't have any side-effects I didn't really notice any benefits I just didn't really notice anything but I was like maybe it will just lift my spirits a little bit maybe I'll just feel less stressed out maybe it will help with my stomach pain maybe it won't do any of that for the first week I didn't notice anything and then there's this one day where I was making music I had my headphones on producing my own music on my computer I noticed that my back started to get hot like I just felt really hot just like my shoulder area the rest of me felt fine so I just like moved around for a minute I thought it was just like the way that I was sitting because I was like typing on my keyboard it wasn't going away and it started to like kind of freak me out and make me a little bit anxious but keep in mind when I get anxiety the worst thing that happens is I'm short of breath and I feel like I can't breathe but this took my anxiety to a whole other level so my back was really hot and it was just localized in that one spot like I walked outside and I was like okay I'll just take some deep breaths like sitting in the Sun for a minute it'll be fine it'll go away well it didn't go away and it just started getting worse and the numbness and heat on my back started shooting up my neck shooting like into my scalp in this whole area it moved all the way up to right here was like tingling and numb it was the most terrifying experience I ran over to my mom I was like this is not okay and she was like yeah your back is pretty hot I was shaking like a maraca I was lightheaded it was just terrible and it probably lasted for half an hour the tingling and then this in the heat sensations in my upper body so after that I was like okay I'm not doing that ever again like I'm done with that for sure that was my experience with Lazarus the last one that I forgot to share and this one is equally as crazy is when I lived in San Diego in 2018 I mentioned that my friend hooked me up with some Flav rx products I tried the CBD pen that did help for the shooting pain in my side which was awesome I was like okay I trust this I trust this brand I trust this company this is cool there was an edible bar like a chocolate bar he also gave me to try my friend and he was like just take a tiny bit like you don't need much and I think the bar was like broken up into little tiny pieces that you can pop off the first thing that I tried the edible bar and I think this had some THC in it which will get you high but it was such a tiny amount that I was like I'm just gonna take this smallest tiniest amount possible so I have no bad experiences so the first night I took just a little tiny piece like half the size of my pinky nail I didn't experience anything the next night or maybe two nights later I took a little piece around like 8:00 p.m. and it says it's gonna affect you in like two hours so by 10:00 p.m. I didn't notice anything like at all so I was like okay I'll just take a tiny bit more so I took maybe another half of a little square and these are like normal chocolate squares these are literally like I said the size of my pinky nail so I took another little tiny tiny piece I woke up around like 1:00 in the morning my body started tingling like my arms were tingling first I was like that's weird maybe I just slept on the wrong and I was like tired and groggy and I just moved over rolled over in bed it wasn't going away it was getting it started to like get worse and I was not anxious like I was asleep I was like completely neutral and my whole body started to go numb I was like okay this is really weird there was like a ringing really loud ringing in my ears but it wasn't so bad yet I called my friend who lived right next door he was asleep it was like 1:00 in the morning or something he didn't pick up as I'm like going through all this the room is getting louder I'm completely blacked out I tried to walk into the kitchen to like rinse my hands and my face underwater and passed out thank God I didn't hit my head on anything but I like fell to the floor my eyes were completely like blacked out I couldn't really see anything I crawled over next door to see if my friend was home but he wasn't home then I crawled back into my house called the paramedics meanwhile my ears are ringing so loud it felt like I died and went to hell like honestly first time I tried to call 911 it was it said Caulfield and I was like oh my gosh I am in hell well I talked to the hotel Naima one's not working I must not be on earth which is really funny but it was not funny at the time and then I called again and the paramedics ended up coming and my friend ended up coming back home and he like sat with me they were like yeah this is your just like really high from the Edible that you took the point of all that was to say that my body went numb my ears were ringing extremely loudly I thought I was dead I blacked out I passed out so that was not a good experience at all so the point of this video in conclusion is to say that I have not had good experiences with CBD at all and I know that a lot of people have you hear about it all the time but if you are someone who has not had a good experience just know that you're not alone and that there are other ways to heal CBD doesn't have to be the thing for you if you've had numerous bad experiences I would just say try something else CBD if it didn't help you at all it's probably not going to be the thing that helps you two years from now and that's kind of a lesson that I've had to learn I'm just a very curious person and it works for everybody else so I'm like I just wanted it to work for me but it just that's three years of experience with CD all wrapped up it did not help with my personal chronic pain at all it made things worse temporarily like when I was using it no long-term negative effects that I am aware of I would say it's worth a shot because I know for a lot of people with mental health issues depression anxiety it helps with that the one time that it did help was with that flave RX CBD pen that made the shooting pain in my side go away pretty immediately but with everything else it didn't take away the pain in my stomach it made me more anxious I had bad side effects numbness tingling blacking out passing out tachycardia lots of not great things I am so curious if you have had your own experience with CBD leave it down in the comments below I would love to read about it we can all learn from each other thank you so much for watching this video I have lots more content coming I try to post videos every Monday sometimes it's Sunday or Tuesday but I hope that you learn something I look forward to seeing you in my next video see you soon bye", "ptSEG5JQ52w": "what's going on everybody got a special little video for you today it's not

I'm reviewing the Charlotte Webb CBD it's 60 milligrams per 1/2 dropper and there are 200 servings per container so okay one thing I did hate about this it's hard to get open I can't imagine what an old person would be going for trying to do this like my grandma would she'll be irritated this is the color it's like a golden brown the taste was pretty plant II did taste like marijuana if you're into that you're not into the marijuana plant taste do not get this one because it does taste strongly like plants so my experience with that I have anxiety I usually take CBD for anxiety I took I took two droppers at first to see her to half droppers at first to see like where I was at when I had anxiety and it didn't go away after the two droppers I waited at least 30 minutes to see I ended up taking two more droppers and it still it went away a little bit more but it didn't fully deplete the anxiety kind of took the edge off and I've had CBDs do that before that's kind of how this one was for me I did have another experience with it and it was very strange so I took the CBD before my yoga nidra class and I don't know if it was the CBD or my anxiety or the yoga class but I felt it up stoned afterwards like like I didn't want to drive it was so weird maybe I was dehydrated but I really I I don't know it was so [ __ ] weird you guys yeah it was kind of like I was like I took a huge edible or something it is full spectrum but I don't think I took that much to get this stoned off of it so maybe I was just like oh my I don't know but that happened other than that yeah I used it for anxiety and it never really fully depleted my anxiety it kind of just kinda just took the edge off a little bit and made me mellow out a tiny bit but not fully but yeah I mean it the CBD works especially if you guys are just getting into CBD Charlotte's Web isn't bad to take they're based out of Boulder Colorado check them out you guys this one is the mint chocolate and the flavor wasn't too bad was too shabby they also have a citrus one I think um if you're in the market for another word yeah just check out their website yeah stay tuned", "0E6-8tE1IfA": "sunday scary cbd gummy review

consuming cbd and they're taking the gummies great the gummies aren't for any of you none of you are supposed to be here go away [Music] no none of you are supposed to be here there are too many of

are the gummies i was wondering where you guys were anyway really excited to try the holiday scaries and the browberries because i've never tried them before why do these bottles feel empty [Music] oh no it's because they are did you guys really eat all of them there are 20 gummies per bottle and you're only supposed to take two to three daily so now you're all really chill huh luckily the cbd comes from hemp not marijuana aka contains no thc so it can't get you high and is perfectly legal so now you're all just really relaxed and full of vitamins still it's a bummer that i couldn't try the new flavors [Music] there are none left [Music] oh no uh sadie you all right up there uh you dum-dums [Music] yes vesper videos will continue tomorrow well i'm disappointed i couldn't try the new flavors but basically the other two the vegan ones are sour and they're pretty tasty and then the standard ones are really good like dangerously good except for the red color i don't like that one for some reason oh my goodness scoob you found some thank you let's start with the strawberry bra berries it's pretty good very sweet as usual there's that cbg aftertaste which is normal holiday scaries spice drops listen these were delicious and might be my favorite ones ever i thought the cinnamon and spearmint would be way too strong of a flavor but they're really really good wow please like and

to my channel so in today's video we're gonna be attempting to make some unfunny bears I got this little kit out of Cracker Barrel and I thought it would be pretty cool to try to make some gummy bears so if you guys are interested in watching this video let's get right to it okay so first thing first we have to unbox this it does come with instructions okay hopefully the lighting is okay here right they come with cherry blue raspberry unflavored gelatin I said okay guys so we have the little tray right here so cute and then we have a little dropper so that we can put off for a little chilly mix in there anyways so I show you guys a little tray right here so cute look at that okay we're gonna start reading the instructions I don't know what this is this is a cherry mix unflavored gelatin and then the blue raspberry I think I'm gonna do the blue raspberry ones just because that's on the ball like oh my try that okay let's let's get started okay since I'm doing a blue raspberry gummy bears you will need 1.8 L to do raspberry gummy mix point 15 ounce unflavored gelatin mix I don't even think I have the measurements let's try to get them okay so I found some measuring cups and obsessed to do 1.8 ounce of the see the blue raspberry gummy mix and this is 1/4 cup it which means is 59 meters or whatever that is and the 1.8 ounce I search on Google it's 53 millimeters so I'm gonna have to kind of wing it here so hopefully prank that it comes out this and if you hear like my dishwasher in the background sorry for that it takes like two hours to freakin watch dishes anyways okay let's see anyways let's just watch it's actually blue I'm dumb I thought it would just be like sugar yeah I don't know wondering I have to put 53 millimeters if this is 15 I'm winking at you guys okay I'm gonna leave it like that okay guys because it's not supposed to hold a little bit more a little bit okay the next thing on our list is to get point 15 ounce of unflavored gelatin it I'm really struggling you guys okay guys I think that the directions right I just need to put this in my array right here and there we have to get 15 I mean point 15 ounces but I'll flavor just mix okay I'll do it right okay guys I did my little calculation and I have to do 4 milliliters of the non flavored gelatin but I have a 5 right here so we're just gonna do 5 good okay we're just gonna do this one okay we're gonna add this into our little mix so far this is what it looks like let me see about the fence if I put you guys here the lighting kind of sucks like right here I will dark but whatever so next thing I have to do is put Oh to see two tablespoons wait wait I'm so confused it says combine a blue raspberry gummy mix point fifteen ounces of unflavored gelatin mix and two tablespoons plus two tablespoons water stir microwave on HIGH 30 seconds I'm comfy use okay we're just gonna put water okay guys I figured it out we're gonna do four of these five milliliter little teaspoons in use [Music] okay I'm gonna stir it because it says to stir and then microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds and then do it again use me use this we got a start okay guys I'm going to add some acidity in here because I'm trying to make some CD gun bears because that's - well you're right here I have the Kois 3000 a CBD natural whatever I'm gonna be like three droplets into this I'm stressed all the time and this helps me a lot gotta shake it shake it shake it okay we're gonna put three jumpers are actually round out another one I use which is a blue raspberry flavored ice gets out of new reg right hopefully oh my gosh it's gonna taste like weed okay we're gonna put 1 2 & 3 so that's about 9,000 that's nine thousand milligrams CBD into that so I'll chop I not do the math but if it gummy bear it's gonna have some type of CD in it cuz they're not chose one it like tastes like weed I guess I'm sure guys what it looks like before I'm microwaving so pretty much I'm just turning it everything ok I think I'm just gonna keep stirring okay guys let's go ahead and microwave this for 30 seconds and then we'll stir again because it says to soar again and then do 30 more seconds okay I sense I'm dumb and I don't know if I could put this in the microwave oh oh my gosh I like it I just don't wanna like chassis it might cat so I'm gonna put it in this cup right here beautiful cut and then we're gonna microwave it [Music] okay go ahead for 30 seconds and then we will be right back okay this is the first little round it looks already kind of get kind of get to eat I don't even know if I'm playing in focus let's go ahead and stir it again Steve microwave 30 seconds stir and then microwave again mr. branch side of tray very lightly with cooking spray so we're gonna get some cooking spray with you and that's that fine you guys got the cookie spray go ahead and put it except to put like a thin layer okay now we have agility then this smells like correct I shouldn't have put that CBD in there but oh well that's kind of kind of mess with the flavor go ahead and stir it okay next one we have to do let's see sprin set of train very lightly oops I did a lot fill bear shaped cavities with mix using dropper under feeling slightly so don't put it all the way refrigerate for 20 minutes it makes 50 gummy bears our guys I'm gonna have 50 cbdu gummy bitters all right let's go ahead and put all these little gummy bears in - dude it's scary you guys I feel like I should probably like No you're good you're good I was gonna say properly like rinse it somehow right they said to not fill it all the way oh my gosh oh my gosh you get a better angle because this ain't working all right let's get this close by let's do this scared [Music] okay guys I call the gummy bears filled up it's kind of messy but don't judge me on that you guys let's go ahead and put these in the fridge I need to be there for 20 minutes they're gonna be sitting here for 20 minutes we'll be back when it's 20 minutes okay guys it's been 20 minutes we're gonna go ahead and try these outs hey guys hold up I'm gonna try to angle just right it's been 20 minutes my hair is like poof puffed out or whatever it's been 20 minutes and this is how okay I've been go ahead and angle this better we're gonna go ahead and try it out hopefully they taste good go ahead and try one let's see if that even chilly oh my gosh it's so cute oh my fellow uh-oh it's gooey here's the first little gummy bear you guys I don't want to grab it right cuz like hold on we are gonna try to grab it it's kind of oily because of all the friends stuff I put on it look at the little gummy bear oh okay we're gonna try this out this one's tiny but I have oh my gosh it's good if it's like blueberry you couldn't you can barely taste the CBD right could taste it so I do the math and there's about 180 milligrams of CBD in each of these little gummy bears so I would have to eat like 20 to get like the effect of like being calm and not being so insight I like so much anxiety oh my gosh look at how cute the berries oh my gosh they don't gummy bear actually really good so I'm gonna say this is a success these gummy bears are delicious Oh what got one that has like a lot of that marijuana taste but overall they thanks beautifully they do taste like blue raspberry so it's that's cool um but yeah I did good I did good okay I'm gonna go ahead and take a whole bunch out and then we'll see how they look together okay guys are you ready to see my little gummy bear crowd it's so cute look at all the gummy bears I need I can't believe I made gummy bears you guys look how cute they are they're so tiny you're trying to get my dogs Oh like you guys my little gummy bear it's so tiny but then we have all the other coming bears in the back oh they look like little Legos okay guys it's gonna be the end of this video hope you guys enjoyed it I made these little little tiny gummi bears it was pretty easy to make the only thing I recommend don't put too much cooking spray like I did cuz they're all slimy and they're hard to take out of the little trays after but anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys the next one strawberry cake", "lAM6hV6oBbE": "hey what's going on everybody so this is my second video in regards to diamond CBD products right now in my hand I have the chill gummy the shower snakes and chill gummy sour beers so in my last video I did the unboxing you know when the products came into the box and how they shipped them and you know etc etc but was in the box this is the actual review of this alright I got some other products but right now for this video I'm gonna be reviewing these the gummies so I got chill gummies sour beers and another package somewhere around there I don't know where these in it anyway I haven't tried these yet but I did try these and this is gonna be my honest review about these now let me tell you so I don't know what other people using for but I bought these solely for the purpose of sleeping as a sleeping eat as Eric you know good things that CBB gummies and stuff to help you sleep and so that's what I've been using these so this reviews in regards to how it's helped me as a sleeping aid and if it does work or not I haven't consumed these in the daytime or you know to hang out or to shell nothing like that I've just used it right before I sleep right so sometimes I get some serious back pains that won't help me sleep so I haven't had those yet thankfully because when I do I can't sleep I just toss and turn but really that was my main purpose for these but anyway I so I have it I'm not gonna review that part yet maybe in the future god forbid happens anytime soon cuz I hate it however so my review for this is just strictly like you know if you gotta wake up in eight hours and you're not feeling sleepy well let me tell you this stuff right here works now this is weird how it works so you know cuz it's weird because when you open it it's like you know all you see is a gummy worm and you just think like okay whatever it's candy like but you don't know what to expect right so my first day trying this it was me my girlfriend she tried it first and she knocked out almost instantly like maybe five minutes after consuming this she closed her eyes got mellow and I say no she's snoring and right after that you know I'm still I was I wasn't ready to sleep yet she had to wake up early in the morning so I was in the bed on my phone finally I'm like you know what I'm scanning a little late let me try one of these even though I wasn't sleepy yet you know on my own after five minutes so I think one of these five minutes after I consumed it I start getting this weird like relaxed euphoria and you know like sometimes when you're sleeping you watch TV and you start like dozing off that's what happened to me but the weird thing is is that it happened literally I went from being normal and five minutes after taking this it hit me like the sleeping has hit me the drowsiness and it was just so weird to me how it really hit instantly you know because I fought it off for another five minutes but after the 10 15 minute mark I like you know what I'm knocking out [ __ ] so I don't know it was so weird to me we woke up the next day like wow these actually work so we took it again the second night again it works like if this really works now let me tell you about a little side effect that you do have with these right so it's so unexpected but I realized it is a real side effect because we my girlfriend both experienced one oh you might wake up in the middle of the night like fully not not not like fully wide-awake but you'll realize that it's only been four five hours that you've been into sleep and you'll wake up a little thirsty you might want to you know drink a little bit of water and then maybe toss and turn for like another 5-10 minutes before you actually knock out again I've experienced that my whole three times that last night was my third national today I was gonna do my fourth night so doc that was my own personal experience that you know with the thirstiness but however me and my girlfriend have both woken up in the in the middle of the night you know so that's one side effect nothing serious still you go back to sleep you wake up feeling good the real real side effect that I have experienced with this believe it or not this gives you some weird dreams now in all cases that I've taken this each night that I slept with this I've actually had some sort of like nightmare Twilight Zone kind of Dreams after this like alright so let me give you a little funny story last night I took these and whatever I'm having this weird dream and in my dream I see the most beautiful paintings like I'm in the art gallery but the paintings are full of sorrow and sadness but I'm looking at them and the paintings start crying and it makes me want to cry and it makes me feel sad but at the same time the paintings are so beautiful I've never seen so like so nice paintings in my life so I wake up a little sad you know and then I realized I'm like those beautiful paintings that I saw in my dream those are actually my paintings because they're in my dream you know like it's just this weird shape and it's not it's not a bad nightmare it was just like trippy [ __ ] that I woke up feeling sad about you know now for people they like to analyze their dreams this is fun I guess you could call it that sorry I'm only kind of look rambling but that was just a little experience that I had with these dummies other than that let me see out of 10 stars I give them between seven and eight stars out of 10 as far as sleeping aid only because they don't have me macking out ready you know every land that I've consumed them I've woken up in the middle night and then gone back to sleep and the thirstiness and then for me I don't mind the nightmares or the weird dreams I kind of enjoy them you know I'm not a person that wakes up and you know sweats and stuff like that I didn't mind it but I'd say it's a side effect because it's happened to me in a row you know the V nights in a row today will be my port so other than that they do work it's weird how they they they work so instantly and so fast that just makes me think like wow man this is some like you can prepare to like medicine how it hits you so quickly like you know if you have ever if you've ever taken a sleeping pill or something but then again it's like since it's a component of marijuana or happens cetera and you know like when you should you know smoke a joint of marijuana or a block it also hits you is me so I guess in a sense it makes sense that that it does work right away anyway these are diamond CBD chill gummies thus our snakes 100x now I see some reviews online that they give you panic attacks or that they made from spikes listen I in mind you I haven't smoked marijuana in on four or five years you know so you know I don't enjoy getting high these did not give me none of that again like I said honestly I only used it before going to sleep I haven't chilled or try to hang out on these after taking these so you know to each his own I personally enjoy them I will be taking them to me again my girlfriend will also you know so that's my review of the diamond CBD children's hope you guys enjoyed it I'll be reviewing some other products like this the blue CBD oil I haven't taken it yet but I will soon and also I did order I don't know where it is right now a CBD cream for for pain let me tell you that's another thing Rainie this right here see because I was in the car accident brought you back pains and leg pains and this helps but that's for another video any of you guys sorry for rambling so much I hope you guys enjoyed it questions concerns comments leave it down below I try my best to respond and have a go", "eG6ui18wwHk": "[Music] what's going on you guys it's George and welcome back to my channel or welcome my channel CBD has been a hot topic for some time now there are many variations of how you can treat yourself with your organic reliever so today I decided I'm gonna share with you guys my experience on how each different form of CBD works for me I have oils edibles a drink body rub a pen believe it or not my experience with each method is different today I'm going to talk a bit about these products what CBD claims to benefit and how these products work for me so keep on watching alright so if Kylie here wanted to have the CBD conversation with us now I'm not gonna dig too deep into the science of CBD because chances are if you're watching this you're probably already familiar with the basics of CBD which CBD can be derived from either hemp or marijuana and it is said to benefit quite a bit of stuff here I have a list just to be hundred with you guys it's said to relieve body aches and pains reduce headaches minimize stress and anxiety promotes relaxation helps benefit your mood and it helps with sleep loss claims do a lot of stuff guys and that's all like common knowledge is is because CBD is kind of everywhere none of the products I'm going to talk about today have what's called THC and that's the psychedelic compound that's found in cannabis also known as pop these products only contain CBD also known as canon video'll I'm not really too sure I pronounced like this science way of can see buddy but yeah you get the hints and CBD it's legal in all states so we'll have fun with dad and I'm gonna kick this video off with talking about one of the most basic forms of CBD and that is the oil I have two oils here today I'm gonna discuss with you guys first one being from the trust brothers this is called hello happiness CBD oil that's 750 milligrams 30 milliliters in this bottle this is a beautiful substance guys let me tell you though you could actually intake the oils in many different forms this one's actually the dollar-a-day CBD product this is a very affordable CBD by the way each one of these products I'm talking about today I'm gonna mention in the description down below as well so you can check these out yourself there's about 30 milliliters the dollar day CBD is 500 milligrams and the hollow happiness by trust brothers is 750 milligrams and you can take this in many different forms as far as like how to ingest it a lot of people just like to put a little amount underneath their tongue some people put it in their drinks like coffee I like to do that in the morning on a weekend or actually any day or it can just like really put this on anything the only issue that I have with the oils is that it likes to flow on top of drinks so when you do put this in your coffee and whatnot you really don't get that kick or effects of CBD until you're like on your last sip even if you stir it I haven't had a different experience using both of these have the same effect as far as how they are used in drinks and also how they they affect me in general the oils thanks Kelly the oils on they're good they do help out with pain relieving as far as like fixing my mood or anything along those lines or pain they simply take away like a minor headache that's my experience with the oils probably one of the most common forms of ingesting the CBD oil is putting underneath your tongue letting it sit there for a couple seconds and swallowing which I guess I'll do that right now does not taste great honestly I have not found a CBD oil that actually has a nice flavor to it these just have a very basic very organic taste to it and I am NOT living for that to be honest it's not that great so the only form of CBD that I've ever ingested ever had that was tasty is the gummy I'm about to talk about so next I'm gonna talk about one of my favorite CD products and this is by not pod this is their gummies I love these I live for these gummies I have one like every single day when it's just like midday going through the gigs and I can use like a little form of calmness and that's exactly what these do this is something that I did a full review on on this channel and of course I'll leave that in the description down below if you want to check it out without talking too much about this company in general guys you'll be really impressed if you were to check out not hot I promise you this is a company that I stand by 100% they have awesome morals and my cats are going crazy right now um I just love not pot and the gummy smells so good and it hits you honestly within like five minutes of taking they call me when I say hit you again it is not a psychedelic type of products none of these are it just instantly for some reason picks up my mood and I'd really appreciate it especially like going through a nine-hour shift at work midday taking one of these helps out amazingly my favorite form of intake from CBD is definitely bee colonies so not pot is a brand view absolutely 100% should be checking out if you're somebody that wants to give CBD a go tastes good they work and this this like I said is an instant mood fixer for me so I really love that and also my not pot bag pretty sick this is the only body product that have that is CBD related this is the trust brothers goodbye pain freeze roll-on pain rub guys this is a great product to use if you're somebody that works outs now I'm not sure how this works with major pain for me I'm not experienced anything luckily knock on wood dad has caused me like major pain to really experiment with this with so as far as just muscle relief and you know minor back pain from sitting in a desk all day it's definitely worked in that type of form but yeah that's pretty great this smells amazing and has very minty experiments therapeutic sense it kind of smells like gum and it really makes you long like orbit right now so I appreciate that but yeah this is pretty cool and I'm not certain of exactly how much this cost but of course I will either in the description too the next product is the only product that I have that guys I am NOT certain about there's a lot of things that are out recently how these pens and jewels and weed pens and whatnot are just not good to ingest and this is by a cured this is a little pen that I've had for some time the almost out but this is CBD infused hemp infused and I'm not had a bad experience using this I've not received any like headaches or throw pain or anything that's negative this actually really does mellow me out for a little bit it's not like a relief that I'm gonna feel the entire day but it's definitely something that I do use every now and Danny does not taste that great to be honest but it's really not about the taste that matters it doesn't taste horrible it just kind of tastes electronic at first I really appreciate this product because I thought it was like cool to have a CBD electronic pen but now with all this stuff going on on the media and how about these I'm kind of just like I don't know I don't know I feel about it so I don't use it that often my last product that I have you guys I'm really excited to talk about this because there's not many drinks out there that are infused with CBD that are on the market this is by boo-boo it's hemp tonic this flavor is a little I'ma be honest and not really finna of the flavor it's yuzu and lotus flower never thought that I'd be drinking those two in my life but we're gonna crack this open it smells like something very organic something that you know maybe you created yourself while in a river I don't know doesn't smell that amazing but I do appreciate the effects that this does provide because this is a very refreshing in a weird way because you could taste how natural this is also whoo boo I received these really cool metal straws right here I just like got a whiff of that smoke from the pen I don't think I'm ever gonna use it then ah you know what it's a hate love relationship with this drink because the first sip it's bitter when I first sets the tongue but honestly it's pretty good this video is not to persuade anybody to try CBD or to shed a light on the CBD community but I just want people to be aware of the different forms and variations of this product that are out there because as far as right now goes with research and studies that have been performed CBD is very helpful for a lot of people people that are going through major health issues and also for people like deal with day-to-day stuff such as anxiety like everybody in this world has anxiety every millennial has anxiety so it's definitely something that I feel like our generation is learning to adapt to and find an organic and natural way to relieve day to day stresses along with major stuff out there such as you know people that have cancer and whatnot they do use forms of CBD and marijuana to relieve their pain so that is definitely something that I wanted to stress I'm not trying to persuade you guys to try CBD but inform you of the benefits and also the many variations that are out there so hopefully you guys found this video to be helpful enjoyable hopefully I shed some light on the CBD world that is out there because prior to me really getting to try a lot of products which this is not an ambassadorship this is not an affiliate by any means this is all products that I genuinely am using better CBD related so prior to knowing that CBD was something other than like a pill or a gummy I had no idea there was like women's and drinks and there's just so much out there there's actually makeup that is like CBD infused and stuff now it's it's insane and I want to try anything that I possibly can get my hands on that or CBD because I feel like it's cool it's something that I do find unofficial and it's something that I think really works for me it's not like a major it's not like a necessity in my life I do want to stress that I can go a day or a week or however long I need to without CBD but let honestly life does get a little crazy so if I need a substitute to help calm me down or give me some form of relaxation CBD is a great method for that and there's absolutely no shame nothing wrong with having a little bit of assistance and bettering your mood helping you relax making you calm down and just having a better day and a better life so if you guys didn't enjoy this video please give it a thumbs up and if you're not already please subscribe to my channel that'd be

these corners too if you like to give that a follow but until next time say thanks give compliments and think positive and I'll catch you in the next video bye guys", "1eitYq8twyM": "hey what's up YouTube Amanda here and I just wanted to say that I had ordered CBB gummies from the CBD distillery calm and I believe that they were delivered so I am going to chatter and I want to do a little review maybe and unboxing see what the scoop is on the CBD distillery gummies I ordered I believe it's 30 milligrams I ordered the vegan gummies so if you want to see what I think about them and hear what they do and all about them stay tuned also if you like these videos and want to see more please give me a thumbs up and subscribe only if you want to and thank you so much also what is CBD if you don't know what CBD is or you're new to it obviously that's probably one of the main reasons why you're doing research on online CBD is a compound that is found in the marijuana plant basically because you all those positive qualities without that sluggish high filling that a lot of people might not like it helps with anxiety seizures some people give it to their children I've seen it used in children with autism with seizure disorders helps with depression pain inflammation it helps just your mood in general it helps you go to sleep there's different ways you can use CBD you can take it in and gummy form is which I'm talking about today excecuted a pill form they have lotions creams they have it in oil forms you can vape it there's tons of different products out there and like this company says there are a lot of gimmicks out there so you kind of have to find what works for you but it seems to be a very positive thing that is helping a lot of people it is all the properties from the plant - the high so you're not gonna feel like a drug test you're not going to get that high loopy tired feeling that you're gonna get all the beneficial positive properties from it - the hi sorry I'm like really hot I'm sweating but um yeah so I just wanted to jump back on here real quick and explain the heads okay guys so when you unbox it this is what the inside of the box looks like they give you a couple little social media things there snap it tag it share it hashtag CBD movement the box is super cute very fall and then down here is the actual goodies right here CBD vegan gummies 30 milligrams per serving I got the CBD isolates there is the Nutrition Facts and other ingredients tells you all about them so that's kind of like what they look like in the bottle another thing they have here they are real big on like no gimmicks so like that's their little one of their little advertising's so they put in like things to look for when buying the CBD boom boom boom so I looked up a lot of stuff on CBD online and which ones to get and this one was at a very good price point I also went back and ordered some oils that go under your tongue and I ordered a 30-30 milligram one and a 17 milligram one so I will when I get those I'll do an unboxing and talk to you about those so let's go ahead and open these try one and talk about it okay so when you get one out of the bottle this is what it looks like little gummy and let's go ahead and try it it does say serving normal serving is one gummy one to two times a day childhood sit in my mouth a little bit okay so the taste is actually really good tastes like a normal vitamin gummy it's not overpowering it's not too sweet it went to how nice I don't know what else to say about it it's really good I've seen some videos or reviews on some of the gummies and they just didn't like the taste like some reviewers said the taste you know it was really strong or it tasted like liquid marijuana I don't get that at all from from this at all it's quite good so I think I'm going to check back in in a couple hours and let you guys know I also want to put out there this is probably the second time that I've ever tried CBD in my lifetime so I have very high anxiety I have postpartum depression so I'm mostly trying this to kind of curve my anxiety I have two children under the age of two right now my daughter she is 20 months and my son is 2 months so I am constantly busy I've always had anxiety pretty much my whole entire life I've always struggled with anxiety and some sort of depression so when I had my son it kind of really kicked into high gear also this isn't my normal filming set up just with the kids and stuff I have to be downstairs right now my filming setup is upstairs in my Beauty room because I do makeup reviews but I've also been trying to make my channel a little bit more friendly for like all the things that I do in my life so if you like these type of videos please let me know and I'm going to check back in in a little bit and let you guys know what's going on YouTube welcome back I am just popping back on to do a update on the CBD distillery companies it's been about four hours since I took one dosage I think I'm going to take another one here in about an hour but I do um feel a little bit different not a whole lot so I probably need to find my perfect dosage my anxiety is a little bit under control um I would like to keep an update on this and maybe check back in in like a week when I am doing them every day taking them every day twice a day like how the recommended dosages on the package and let you guys know what I think of it this video was kind of just like a first impression unboxing video into basically taste one on camera and let you guys know my first thoughts and impressions obviously so I would like to continue them check back in and let you guys know my full honest opinion on them so far um I'm having a little bit of mixed thoughts so far they're working and so far as are not working as much as I'd hoped I know they have to go down through your digestive system and get digested so that's why I'm excited to try the oils that I

home baby son mm-hmm good boy", "dPHT72UwbR0": "- What's up everyone? Caleb here with Hemp Daddy's Therapeutics. And I'm here today to\nanswer one of the questions I get asked the most, and it's Does CBD make you high? And how does it make you feel? This is one of the\nnumber one search queries in Google that lands\npeople on our website, so I know a lot of you are answering it so I thought I'd do a\nlittle YouTube video on it. But before we get started, we gotta talk about what the\ndifference in THC and CBD is. So, THC is the component of\nthe plant that gets you high. CBD is a whole 'nother\ncomponent of the plant. It's another cannabinoid. So, the cannabis plant, hemp as well, has a whole array of cannabinoids. All of them have medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. CBD being the number one\nmedicinal and therapeutic benefit out of all of the cannabinoids. That's why all these\ncompanies are isolating CBD. One of the things you're\ngonna start seeing here in the future is people isolating other\nthings like CBC and CBG. Because they all have unique medicinal and therapeutic benefits. So THC, on the other hand, is the component that is responsible for getting you high. But it does also have therapeutic benefits such as reducing the size of tumors and helping with pain management as well. But CBD, on the other hand, it's got all those medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits and many, many more, but there's no high associated with it. So if you have, whatever it is, whether it's a moral issue, or you just don't like\nthe feeling of being high, like CBD will not get you high. There's no chance of it at all. You could probably drink an entire bottle and not even get high. You know, don't go out and try that, I'm not advocating that at all. But because there's so much CBD to THC, like basically CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC. So, let's say you smoked a joint, for say, if you did that along with a dose of CBD, you're not gonna feel as high as you would if you just took THC alone. So CBD has no psychoactive effects, so there's not risk of\ngetting high with CBD. It just has all the medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. So let's talk about how it makes you feel. So, basically, it just\nmakes you feel good. So, I kinda relate it to a runner's high. When you get that flood of endorphins and you just feel great,\nyou feel positive, you're completely lucid, your\nmind is in the right place. It's kind of the same as CBD. And honestly, it kinda\nbecomes like your new normal. So let's say you take\nCBD for the first time, you're probably gonna\nreally feel the effects. But after you've been\ntaking it for a full month, you're not gonna notice\nthe effects as much even though they're still there, it just becomes the new normal. Like, you start feeling better. So if struggle with stress,\nor anxiety, or depression, like those things can\nreally benefit from CBD. And so, if you just wanna take CBD just to relax at the end of the day, to wind down, to sleep better, CBD is great for these things. You'll feel nothing but positive benefits. There's no negative side effects. You're not gonna feel tired and drowsy just because you took CBD. So basically, CBD works by\ncalming your mind, that's, so when I say it helps with sleep, it helps with sleep by calming your mind. So if you're the type of person whose mind is always racing when you go to bed and you\nhave a hard time sleeping, CBD is gonna help with that. But if you take CBD during the day, it's not gonna make you sleepy, so don't worry about that. And again, CBD does not\nmake you high whatsoever. It's the THC that gets you high. So if you're taking CBD oil, if it's a full spectrum,\nor a broad spectrum, it doesn't matter, there's not gonna be enough THC content in order to get you high, so consume CBD and you're\ngonna get all of these positive and great benefits with no risk of getting high.

going through some situation whether we see it externally or the just kind of harvesting it internally we all have some sort of battle that we're facing and dealing with a date in the day out so for

guess who I see I don't know is that the right word sorry guys I don't really I don't really I don't smoke so thanks now but I can tell you that let me call myself a real quick thing like saying stuff but I can tell you that the cannabis is not in this product now this is a Hevesy me game so they take I believe make me like the hemp seeds and extract that out and kind of create this product again doesn't have THC so you will not have the psychoactive high that you normally get if you smoke weed so I don't know what the kids call it these days but that is one of the great factors with using a

100% medically and this is not fantastic by the FDA so I will tell you guys that much so the food truck food and drug administration has not why don't you approve this I don't know how they get

industry from the top flavor formulators to the pioneers developing functional and national national and natural solutions around everyday life we are based in Irvine California and all of their CBD is grown in Loveland Colorado now just so you know all of they do state that all of their CBDs run exclusively in Longmont Colorado offering a 100% broad-spectrum CBD that is all-natural organically sourced the Colorado agricultural department is one of the strictest in the nation and we're proud to be part of the USA so they go on about the cannabinoids and other products or materials of the new modesty materials kind of sparkly but you guys know what I'm saying so they've worked with their flavor scientists for over two years develop the best tasting CBD on the market their customers and their fans enjoy the product as well you know what give you guys might speak on that to all of the CBD is I have two percent THC free of the USA federal government has a requirement that the maximum teeny-tiny CBD is 0.3% so I can't remember because I couldn't like keep re recording this video right she knows what the perfect video so I did I was ensuring there's point 3 2003 percent so it has to have that or less in the CBD products for it to really pulled the name of the true name of the seed CBD product I feel like a tear attached planted so you can see power THC come on as much much less you can also see the lab report which shows zero harmful solvents and all the 80 plus natural occurring cannabinoids and turkeys oh my second that we're great we make all of these labs test results available for every back to CBD oil because we believe in a bunch of percent transparency which is fantastic that every day you hear a company that's actually putting out their lab results we are a leader in the CBD space operating one of the first manufacturing facilities with both iossef what a GM key certification and just so you guys know it broad spectrum whatever fits that earlier it just basically means all the natural occurring cannabinoids in proteins without THC so that's years so they sent me this product and some facts on this product as far as what it tastes like first so it is sweet and it smells really good it's so to me it smells I'm gonna give you guys my 100% honest opinion it smells sweet it smells like sugar although there's actually only one gram of sugar in it which are you really surprised I'm really happy about there's only 10 calories per serving it's a good size it's just one that means someone's not me it's gonna be ten to ten calories but for me personally it tastes fine there is this like aftertaste it isn't bad but you can taste like you know if you eat something it does taste kind of like medicine it's not a bad taste by any stretch of the means it's fine that's what bothered me because a lot of the CBD candy edibles as well as even the oils have a after taste not bitter but I can't really explain it so if you're interested definitely try them out or you can go to your local CPD store you know that sells these there's so many pop-up shops that are you know growing throughout the US also I imagine it depends on what state you live in but there's so many people that are reaching out to CBD it does also help with pain which that was my biggest thing and I have a lot of back pain aren't really that issues from having my son and I cannot run anymore so my options of working out heart very limited when I comes to my back so I did use and I have used CVD a couple of years agos when I started about two three years ago and it has helped me immensely my sister actually had back surgery last year in March of 2018 and it has helped her immensely as well also helps her with stress and anxiety which is the main reason why we and my family actually use this it definitely helps my day if I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed or stressed anxiety issues are popping up I will take a gummy or I would take an oil and it also depends on what you need so you really need to kind of be careful what the milligrams that you're taking or the oil the level of the motor is you're taking with the oil for me personally I was taking about I think it was like 0.75 but I also would take as far as the oil rose and then when it comes down to the dummy's itself I've taken a thousand milligrams for one coming that's just what I made and what my body means so I am so grateful that you guys were able to send this to me so thank you so much again called my illness again let me tell you guys it's only ten milligrams per gummy so I would need to have at least ten of these in order for her attend amazed it's only 100 gaiting no I would need way too many of these cuz I'm not gonna come she's good order for me to get this my one shot a thousand milligrams because that's what I eat that's what my body needs my boyfriend is the same way can't speak about my feeling not sure what they're on or what they're using but I know these the oils because oil do drop couple drops underneath your tongue let it sit there for about 30 seconds or as long as you can before you swallow for it to actually get in and deep into your bloodstream for the gummies I love using the guns right before bed because it does help me sleep help me keep stayed asleep and supposed to waking up with things saying there we go what am I gonna do tomorrow we're gonna do later today this week next week next month that's just me personally as a person so overall I do like the taste it's great I kind of went into a huge spiel there but I do like the taste this does retail for $60 and it's valued at electric I believe further website so if you are interested so yeah its $59 or you can subscribe to get 10% off I will let you guys know later during evidene if there is like any special code free advice to get any other percentage off by doing this but I really like these I would get these in a higher dose because I need at least a thousand milligrams for one dummy for me to have any type of effect so I don't feel anything on 10 milligrams it's too low for me personally but everybody's different so you might want to try it try a small sample before you buy a bigger battle that's it so there's really nothing else I really could say about these gummies because I cannot tell you for 100% fact whether this will definitely improve my sleep or help me with anxiety attacks than I'm having because my CVP definitely helps me with that previously an other I don't have other products and brands that I've used before so just keep that in mind everybody's different everybody needs to take different types of milligrams um based on their body types and what how quickly their body can break down the product at 13 P so keep that in mind but if you guys have any questions I'd be happy to answer them as best as I can sorry I'm not like some pro on CBD and THC except the fact that no tips you get you high home and that chips it's not in CBD whether it's skincare makeup candy edibles oils whatever it may be so thank you guys for watching hopefully you guys got some info some something insightful out of this video and again ask me any questions and I will try to answer them and if not I will point you in the direction of kawaii bottles [Music]", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "NcARQsUrkDY": "well let's start this meeting I'm here with the oil barons my name is Denis Chapman and we all just came back from an amazing conference in Las Vegas Sandra is the leader of the oil barons team and we're going to give you guys a little presentation about some of the new things that happened at this event Sandra what would you like to say before we roll our first video just that convention was amazing we're not going to elaborate on convention though our main goal here tonight is to go over some of the products because we have so many products released that we really don't want to overwhelm you with a very long video so we're going to focus on three of the different products tonight and we are going to start with the new 1500 milligram and Denise is going to roll a little tape for you guys before we go into that [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so first and foremost I'm hoping that for those of you who are out there that are currently using our products you're going to notice that we have a whole new look to our bottle which is really exciting the old bottle is kind of had a little green swish that went across the front and you really couldn't at a glance tell if it was natural that was peppermint or if it was cinnamon so basically recreating the look of it is going to make it so much easier as we continue to add new flavors the other thing that we have on the bottom now is we have a QR code which is I think we're the one of the only ones in the industry that might even have that and why that is so exciting is you can take that bottle scan it with your phone and it takes you over immediately to the documentation and the third-party testing on that specific bottle so just again the other thing is that it's going to have the HAMP certification seal which we work really hard to get we are one of 15 companies out of 22,000 that have applied to the u.s. hemp Authority and so we have that certification seal which basically means that what we say is in our oil is exactly what's in our oil there's no BS there's no you know we're not trying to sell you something that we're not so what we say is in our oil is in our oil and again and it is the purest oil on the market so the new oil that we released is the 1500 milligram and so lots of people are saying well why did you guys create such a high milligram well the reason is that's what you guys wanted we've done several surveys and polls and that was one of the highest selected products that people wanted to see and they have priced it phenomenally so a bottle of the 1500 costs $149 so if you bought three bottles of the 500 would cost you what is that two hundred and ten seven yeah so you can see the saving so if you're taking the 500 you buy a four pack or whatever you might start buying the 15 because you're just going to take less drops and then that ball is going to last you longer so you know just amazing the way that they've priced pointed that so I think the label came out really great it's easy to decipher the flavors we know we've got the different color-coordinated strips on the side let me just see if there's anything I've missed and really it does it clears the way for you know for some new flavors that are going to be coming soon yeah so you know if I were to go into a dispensary here in Las Vegas and we've got them at every street corner and I were to buy a 1500 milligram of CBD oil I guarantee you if it cost me over $200 and that you don't know what you're getting so with us you know what you're getting Wow let's see then that we're going to go into I'm going to kind of share something the cat's kind of out of the bag so a lot of people that asked us well why didn't they give us a higher milligram on the THC free well the reason being is is that we're kind of going to be phasing out of the isolate and so what we're going to be doing is we're going to start eventually and I don't know when but we're going to start making the broad spectrum and so what that means basically is you're still getting THC free but now you're getting all these other cannabinoids that you weren't getting in the isolate so you'll still test negative on a drug test but again you're getting you know you're getting that effect of having all of those other cannabinoids in there so instead of you know focusing on the eye slits there what's going to happen is we're gonna have the different milligrams and flavors and everything eventually in the broad spectrum so to me that's super exciting because now those who are taking the isolate are gonna get I think a much better result with the product so it's not gonna have THC in it so that's it for the 1500 milligram so excited and I'm waiting for mine to come in the mail so yeah so the next thing we're going to talk about is the gummy bears and nice is going to show you guys a little video on that they come in three flavors orange so they are gluten-free but not only you'll see a lot of the market these are made we're not spraying on the CBD they're actually infused in the gummy so that gummy like I said is 10 milligrams each it's it's what a lot of you asked for so we came back so here it is so we're super excited about that another thing I explain to you is not only is it makes you free but what we call these are actually broad-spectrum so you'll still test negative on a drug test but the best there's more cannabinoids so that's what we love about this product and it tastes good like I said it's got three flavors or is 45 companies in each jar and it's a fantastic price so I'm excited about getting mine soon and yeah I think those are gonna be awesome but if I have those on my desk and probably eat the jar one sitting show probably not the best for me yeah and the best thing too is that for parents who have children that have a really hard time taking the oil these are great because lutely they're like handy to them so you know they can get an income maybe start with a half or whatever but still yeah awesome amazing they're all natural there's also artificial free artificial flavoring and sweet that was 69 was yeah and so the big deal that they are gluten free and so I guess most of them are made with gluten so hopefully that's going to be you know really important to people right so we're gonna go on to the new size of the renew and the relief and I've got a little video I'm going to run on that I know people love that because it's nice to have a big jar of that stuff so just let me cue that up here and we will carry on all right okay I'm super excited about this bigger size because I use the relief and the renewed daily and so everybody was like we need bigger jars and so that's what we got I'm so excited that we got the bigger jars of the relief and renew now the relief we have 50 millimeter jars and they have a hundred and thirty milligrams of total CBD and we're going to continue to carry the smaller jars of cream but the larger jars are going to give you more value because it's only an extra $20 so the original ones are thirty milliliter and there's sixty nine dollars and if you want to upgrade to the bigger jar it's fifty milliliter for $89 Wow I just realized that that's almost double for $20 yes it stays so and we still have the 60 day money back guarantee and so that which is huge and then the renew cream it's the you know the same thing applies for the relief and the renew we carry the smaller jars and the bigger jars have more milligrams of the CBD for only $20 more and the relief is our most popular tocqueville and it's infused with 80 milligrams of hand the dial CBD and it's also infused with the emu oil which is something I use before this came out which is it's just unbelievable when you put the combination of it together the the relief is a very potent formula and it gives you the comfort you need like say your back is a little strained or your feet are sore the relief is the perfect product for you you just gently massage a dime sized amount into your affected area and you just watch the tension melt away and it's for external use only and on the renew you're gonna just love your skin this I love it I use it every day and I can tell you my age but I'm up there and it's really helped my face but it's infused with 80 milligrams of CBD and it has the apple stem cells that's also known we call it the Fountain of Youth and the apple stem cells have been known to have tremendous benefits to the skin you just gently take a little dime size and rub it into your face I do it morning and night and I just do it every day I call it my daily choice and if you go you know on the my daily choice website it'll tell you that it may help you your skin look younger tighter and brighter I'm not gonna say made for me it definitely did and it could have increased longevity of your skin cells and it also comes with a 60-day money back guarantee so can't go wrong but it's I'm excited about that we have a lot more we have bigger jars now because I need bigger jars pardon me your skin looks amazing oh thank you yes I just turned 67 so I know it is the cream really I can show you pictures before and they didn't look and feel this good that's awesome I can't wait [Laughter] I'm just gonna enter one thing and on the on the new shipments that are going to start coming out they have increased the 80 milligrams of CBD to 130 correct yeah yeah so now instead of 80 milligrams so just two months ago we started with 50 milligrams and then they went up to 80 and now they've increased it to 130 they're not charging any more money for all that added CBD which I just think is mind-boggling so I can't wait to get a new jar yeah yeah it's amazing products good deal so I guess that's the end of this meeting we're going to be doing another one in a couple days on our new mantra essential oils so be sure to tune in for that and once again this is the oil barons team and the leader is Sandra laborat out of Las Vegas so if you want to join an amazing group of women then this is the team to join so thank you ladies and we'll see you again in a couple days all right

Hi, I am Matt and welcome to another CuredByNature\nepisode - CBD Frequently Asked Questions. After such a long time of cannabis stigma,\nthe truth is finally out. Cannabis is very good for the human body. Most of the people know about THC - the cannabinoid\nIn the cannabis plant that gets you high, right? One other cannabis component has been massively\nresearched for the past 30+ years, because of its health benefits. And that\u2019s CBD or Cannabidiol. And since CBD does not get you high or in\nother words, it\u2019s not psychoactive the way THC is,.. and because US president Trump signed\nthe new Farm Bill in December 2018, you can buy CBD products almost anywhere these days. From local health shops to different online\nshops. And believe it or not, the majority of the\npeople prefer not to be stoned or high all the time. That makes CBD products ideal cannabis products. You get the benefits of cannabis but without\nthe high. Now back to the subject\u2026 Full Spectrum CBD vs CBD Isolate\nIf you\u2019ve done just a little bit of research you know there\u2019s basically 2 kinds of CBD\nproducts. Products made with Full Spectrum CBD\nand Products made with CBD isolate. First the Full Spectrum CBD\nIt\u2019s also called Full Spectrum CBD Extract,... or Whole-plant CBD extract or FECO that stands\nfor Full Extract Cannabis Oil. It includes all of the cannabinoids found\nin the cannabis plant and also includes all the other components that get extracted out\nof cannabis flowers in the process. These other components are terpenes, waxes,\nhealthy fatty acids and chlorophyll. And you know what,... there are other components\nin the cannabis plant that get extracted in the process that we are not even aware of. But that\u2019s a story for another time. So when we say \u201cfull-spectrum,\u201d we\u2019re\nreferring to a naturally extracted spectrum rather than a constructed spectrum. Now let\u2019s talk about the CBD isolate:\nCBD isolate is just CBD. It\u2019s just cannabidiol molecule isolated\nor separated from other cannabis compounds in the plant. Now to the big question:\nWhat to choose - Full Spectrum CBD or CBD Isolate There are studies that give scientific proof\nthat Full Spectrum CBD that also includes low amounts of THC plus other cannabinoids,\nterpenes, etc. produce what is known as an Entourage Effect. The synergistic relationship between all of\nthe cannabis components has been shown to increase the healing properties of each. But when it comes to CBD isolate,... even\nthough it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you would fail a drug test or experience a form of \u201chigh\u201d\nbecause of the low amounts of the THC in those Full Spectrum CBD products,... some people\nprefer to be on the safe side. So now you have the information you need to\ndecide... CBD Isolate vs Full Spectrum CBD My suggestion is always Full Spectrum CBD. Why? Well, when it comes to health I don\u2019t think\nwe should hold back. This is a natural medicine and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense not to get the full benefit out of it.

I am Matt,... Thanks for watching!", "DCbCrqtqvyc": "[Music] hi guys it's Brandi from green wellness life thought I would chat with you a little bit today about capsules they do come in different sizes strengths and variations and I get a lot of questions about those and what the differences are because there can be some different price points as well I do also have a lot of people ask me that if taking CBD in a capsule is just as good as taking it in a tincture or a raw extract form you know my answer is generally the best CBD is the one that you'll actually take every day so if you know yourself and you know that that grassy earthy hemp flavor that comes from a tincture a raw extract is not for you know you're just not comfortable taking it in a liquid and you'd rather take a capsule then by all means do it the capsules can take a little longer to get to work for you just because your body has to digest them before the CBD can start to do its thing but the end result should be the same for you whether you're taking it from a tincture or a capsule so I might say that I've got three basic variations of capsules soft gels traditional powder capsules and then what I call a hybrid which is kind of somewhere in between the two so soft gels I have right here is from Entourage oops almost ripped it this is just encapsulated hemp oil you can see it's kind of a light and amber color it's squishy and if I were to stick a knife in the end of this guy then that oil would squeeze right out so I actually have some customers that say that they like to buy these capsules just because they know their serving size because those milligrams are sat per capsule so they actually buy these I'm just a competitor a knife in the end squeeze it out under their tongue and go on about their day so I have soft gels from Entourage from Tuesday hemp oil and also from Plus CBD so these are just the traditional hemp oil extract that's been encapsulated next one is or the other end of the spectrum I guess we should say is the traditional powdered capsule and that is just what it sounds so this has been through more processing to take that CBD oil and get it down to a powder to stay and then fill up these little Koen capsule guys so this is been a little bit more processed these are from plus CBD great product super popular and a little bit lower price point but it is it is surprising to some people to see that it really is a powdered capsule so really traditional then we've got what I call the hybrid in dhoka falls into this category as does CBD FX so that's another one that I would call a hybrid so looks more like that first softgel a little bit squishy but you wouldn't be able to just stick a knife in the end and squeeze the oil out there's more of a paste and this it's a little bit thicker consistency paste like but not full powder and capsule so kind of somewhere in between the two those I have in all different variations I've got 10 25 and 50 milligrams strengths so I think it's an easier way likely for the manufacturer to take that humble extract not worry about thinning it out or adding any oil carriers to make it a soft gel but kind of leave it as sort of that waxy middle ground definitely thinner and not powdered but not a full-on soft gel so those are kind of the three variations personally I prefer a soft gel or in that middle hybrid which I'm sure is not actually what they call it but that's because I'm kind of a baby and I don't like to take regular capsules it's just not my preference as a human so I like the soft gels but everybody has their own their own preference and in their own best way which is why we do carry multiple variations because they want to make sure that there's something for everybody so I hope that this helped a little bit and I hope that you have an awesome day always email or give me a coffee you've got any questions that email is support at green wellness live.com support at green wellness live.com or you can always give me a buzz at eight eight eight seven seven two seven eight seven five thanks so much make it a great day [Music]", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

about hemp lucid CBD gummy bears hapless at CVG gummy bears are on our website we like them very much I personally like them because they're organic they're made by good quality CBD oil and they're very easy to use they come in either a bottle form of gummy bears or you can get the small pack just to try them out the small pack comes in a count of five you can just order them just to see if you like them they work really well I'll take one right now what I like about these is that when you eat them they don't have such a bitter taste like some CBD gummy bears still some of the CBD gummy bears carry a very bitter taste like the sour patches where these have a tiny bit of sour patch taste to it but not overabundance so you can actually eat it it doesn't it's you're not getting overwhelmed by that little bit a bitter taste and it's easy to swallow it's easy to digest and within a couple of minutes you notice the difference I usually give myself about 5-10 minutes and I start to notice that there's a little bit of change in calmness I start to relax more I get a little bit more focused because there's not so many things running in my head you know I'm the type of person that I'm always thinking always thinking about the next thing to do then the next thing after that and what I have to do tomorrow and so forth but when I you know use CBD I tend to relax and I'm not so worried about everything that's going on in the future and I just focus on now and I'm able to just be calm and that anxiety goes away CBD is great for people who want to get a good night's sleep who have trouble sleeping at night because same reason you they just can't get into that certain Rama sleep you know and they're just light sleepers and they just you know they can't get into that relaxed stage or they're just constantly thinking about something and they can't tend to just let their mind go and relax and just go off into that other world and fall into that nice deep sleep it's also good for people who are get stressed who just you know feel anxious you know they just need to relax a little bit of calmness in their life a little bit of serene feeling you know CBD gummy bears or see any type of CBD oil is really good for that you know CBD is also very good for chronic pain they also came out research that it's helped in cancer and that they also had much success in the epilepsy community with CBD oil for people who suffer from seizures and myself personally I like to take it I take CBD at night every night and I take it for several reasons I take it from my epilepsy I take it for to help me relax at night and I take it just you know sometimes during the day just to get a tad bit feeling of calmness now with the hemp lucid CBD gummy bears I like them I think they they start to work quickly they're effective and like I mentioned before they don't have that bitter taste like some of those CBD going bears some of them carry a really strong sour patch type taste where this is a mild very mild sour patch type taste which I like a lot I hope I helped you you know I hope you uh you know I understand a little bit more about how to lucid it ranks really well anytime they have done reviews different in the marijuana and CBD community they have mentioned the effectiveness of lucid and how well it works I personally from my own experience feel that it works really well I have it on my website because I really I don't carry anything that I don't believe in and hemp and lucid I like their quality I like the way it works and I like the company the way they conduct themselves the way they present themselves and greed ian's they use and how they their whole mission is so if you have any questions feel free to jot it in the comment box I'll answer any questions you have and I hope I helped you and I you know have a great night", "Xpp7UFiZ6iU": "hey guys so my name is Jan and I am making this video because I just bought the Charlotte's Web extra-strength and extracts oil in the mid chaplet favor this is the new packaging that they have this is not the lowest dosage this is kind of like the medium dosage and I bought it from a store called seven-leaf clover in my neighborhood and this particular model was 75 dollars and this is the smallest bottle and this is the truck this is what I got this is the 28 milligram serving on the packaging it says that you have to take two dropper sizes and that's one of the servings says that right thing right here now the reason why I bought this oil is because I have anxiety it's not like crazy but I do get nervous every once in a while I have a very stressful job so I'm always stressed out and then on top of that I have been having some really bad back problems like I have like really bad back problems so I have done a lot of research on the Charlotte's Web I've looked at YouTube reviews I looked on their website and I wanted to buy something that was good quality high-end I didn't want to go for anything cheaper I did see some other items in the store you know that looked good but you know I this is a very popular brand so I wanted to try it now The Dropper the girl at the store named Jen she was very very lovely she explained it to me she says that the dropper doesn't have any anything on it like in regards to measurements I'm sorry Mike there's no one there's no letters on it which is a little bit disappointing because for the price I paid I would expect it to have like you know the dosage amount on the actual dropper she did explain when you do press the dropper it only goes about halfway so you would take two of these and that would be one serving she explained that I should try it at night and see how it works out for me and then continue to take it and then when I start to feel more comfortable maybe going over two to one in the morning and one at night so I'm gonna try it today and I forgot to ask how long it takes to go into effect so I'm gonna assume that it takes anywhere from like thirty to an hour to feel and in about thirty so an hour I'll be back I'm going to show you guys I'm gonna take it she did say shake it and from the reviews I've also seen people shake the actual it says actually here on the on the packaging shake well before using store in a cool dry place away from the light and of course the regular do not use at the safety seal is broken or missing my safety seal was on and I opened it in the store with the girl just to check you know like the dropper because I was interested in seeing if it had like little numbers on it and I think Charlotte's Web should do better with the dropper because again for the price that you're paying you would expect it to be there you know I would expect it to be there she also did explain that you have to put it underneath the tongue and hold it there for like about 30 seconds so I'm gonna go ahead and do that again I'm gonna take my dropper and [Music] all right guys so as you saw I took about half of the dropper twice and I left it under the tongue for a few seconds the the flavor is not as bad as a lot of reviews I said it's like a minty flavor it tastes like mint oil it's it's not that I actually expected a lot worse so I'm I'm I'm very excited to try this and I'm hoping fingers crossed that it works because I need to I feel like my mind is always constantly running you know I have a new baby he's about 8 months old now and you know work is stressful you know having a baby a new baby is stressful so you know I just need my mind to be calm I want my body to be calm I did have the epidural when I was when I was delivering my son so that could be the problem that could be the issue - why well that could be the reason why - why I have back problems and so you know like I had to get a whole new bed like I had to like you know just to get my back to feel better but hopefully this is something that works out for me for the pain and to keep me level-headed at work because there my job is very stressful that there's little situations that trigger me and I'm able to keep it I'm able to keep it professional but I but inside like I feel like now my blood is boiling but I feel like any minute can be triggered into like this whole episode um and I don't want that to happen because I do like my job this one also I forgot to mention this Charlotte's Web oil contains coconut oil it's not like the there's another one that you can buy which is the same thing except for that one is olive oil I don't think that it would taste any different I'm not sure maybe I'll try it next time um but again guys I'm gonna be back in about a half an hour to an hour and let you even know how it works see you guys in a few hey guys so I'm back it's been about almost 40 minutes since I took the CBD oil and I don't feel high my biggest concern about this was that I did I was looking for something that doesn't have any THC because I don't like the way I don't want to feel let me see if I can put it in better words I don't want to feel high I just want to feel calm but I overall do feel calm which is great I am not experiencing any kind of high like a THC one I'm not high at all um I'm not gonna give it a crazy thumbs up I'm going to give this a try I'm going to continue to record my experience with this particular CBD oil I do hope that it does work for me in the long run I do I don't feel any back pain right now which is pretty good I like that hopefully I could good I can get a good night's rest with you know we're taking this I don't know if I'm gonna take some in the morning I do / I'm gonna feel calm with my day tomorrow so that might be something that I do not report that as well but it's a pretty good experience so far we'll see how it goes but this is the video that I wanted to make I wanted to make this video so I can let the people know kind of a review about me being honest on a particular product again there's no high just a relaxation I feel calm I feel a little bit tired so my leg down for a while [Music] so guys if you have any comments or any questions please put them in the box below please no negative comments I just want good positive vibes from people I'm gonna continue to you know keep uploading videos on my journey with this particular CBD oil and hopefully", "wIIotssIBYo": "[Music] this [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you", "LfdsaO34phE": "hello everyone and welcome to my channel I am low to describe and today I'm gonna be talking to you about a product that I have here that I have been using for a little while now I have been using CBD products before and they have helped me and so I decided to try this brand this brand is called just CBD and the these are their Signature Series cartridges the one that I have right now that I am currently using is the pineapple express this is a hybrid cartridge it says so right here on the label and another one that I have been using is the is the Sour Diesel this is one of those sativa cartridges they come in this clear plastic container with like a cork top so I think that's pretty nice that they do that this is how they actually look right here so this is the full-spectrum container this is glass right here and it comes with this pretty awesome wood tip and I shall see that right there how it looks and I have been using it with this vape pen its BIOS if y'all haven't heard of that brand or I'm sure that y'all have heard of the brand it's very good very reputable brand it comes with a that you can set the voltage down here at the bottom and you can choose which voltage you would like to have it as so with me I use CBD products mostly for my depression in my anxiety I also use it to calm my nerves whenever I feel stressed out or in a stressful situation I have used Lazarus naturals before the only thing with that is with that one it kept me up at night and then I did you CBD MD and that helped me as well and so I decided to try these out since I have been tired more tired lately and so I decided to try the pineapple Express and the Sour Diesel since the pineapple Express is a hybrid cartridge and I read on there it is a 60% sativa and a 40% what's a 60% sativa and a 40% indica and they're Sour Diesel is a sativa so they have lab reports on their cartridges and they also have lab reports on other products that they do have that y'all can check out so with these with the Geist CBD brand the cartridges they have another one also so they have the sativa the Sour Diesel the hybrid pineapple Express and they also have another one called Northern Lights now Northern Lights is an indica as for more of like whenever you want to relax more of you can use it before bedtime to help you sleep I haven't tried that one yet but I'm going to be trying that one soon enough I might get it later on today or tomorrow I have to see if I have time to actually go purchase it but these two cartridges that I have here they have been really helping me out lately with giving me more energy with giving me more of a positive outlook because usually with my depression I was given by the doctor antidepressants to take but I haven't taken those yet because I would like to try more natural stuff before I actually take antidepressants so I have been doing my research on what products to take I have been doing my research on on the different terpenes on that health depression and different terpenes that help would get more energy more activity more focused and so far these have really been helping me this brand has really been helping me so far and I'm gonna try there like I said I'm gonna try there indica Northern Lights and then also with this whenever I take a hit from it it is like the smoothest inhale I have ever taken from from a CBD brand it is like very very smooth on the throat does not irritate the tro does not irritate the lungs these two that I have they come in 200 milligrams CBD and it's 100% u.s. grown hemp has a right here on the label and also it has it on their website and like I said before they have lab reports on all of their products so y'all can check their products to make sure how much CBD or you are getting how much what the terpenes are that you are getting I highly suggest this brand I bought these out of my own money so I'm not endorsed I'm not a paid by them or anything and I don't have like a affiliate link to use I have just been using these out of my own interests and out of my own for my health to help me get better and so that I can do more one thing that I want to let you know that I have talked about in my other CBD products reviews is that with any CBD product there if you have to take a drug test there is a possibility that you come out positive for THC depending on your on where you work if they drug test you or if they don't there are people or companies that say like on here it says zero percent THC I'm not sure if you I can see that zero percent THC let me show the other one actually they have recovered up but it says zero percent THC on it and so whenever it says represent THC that is 0% basically it is under the amount that's that's not legal it's under the amount that's that's detectable for THC on the lab reports that they done but there have been cases in a group that I follow on facebook called CBD oil users I highly recommend y'all check it out if y'all can but on that group that I follow they have been cases where people have said that they took a drug test from their job and they came out positive and they ended up having to lose their job because they thought the product was you know the people told them it was zero percent THC you're not gonna be show up on a drug test and all that but you can on any CBD product you can show up on a drug test because over time it accumulates in the fat cells and it also depends on your metabolism and each person is different they're having people who have been on CBD for like a year and they have not come out positive and there's people that have been on CBD for a month and they have come out positive so it each depends on the person but as for these the gist CBD brands the pineapple Express in the Sour Diesel the taste I don't know if it's just me but they taste very similar but that just could be my taste buds I'm still you know China deciphered the flavor it's they taste to me more of like floral what do you type but that's just me and my taste buds and on what I've tasted so far there is another CBD product that I have been taking that our review next time and I just wanted to show you all these these ones that I had I bought these at my local smoke shop they had a very good reputable reputable brands that I seen these were $34.99 for each one and I would think that it's worth it because of the way that they look the way that the glass and the full-spectrum is and also comes with this really awesome tip one thing that I do get to say though that I didn't like about them it could be the shop itself on and on how long they had the product or it could be the way that they are packaged but when I first bought the my first cartridge which was this one it was gunked-up at the bottom it was gunked-up at the bottom and I'm not sure if you I can see these little holes right here but they were like black and I'm guessing because maybe the CBD oil with the conduit it just got clogged up and so when I went to take a hit and nothing came out so I had to go back I got another one that looked like this like they had the black and nothing came out of that one either until we found one that was clean one that was clear and I made sure with this other one to make sure that it was clean and clear and I took a hit from those that let me test it before I took it out to make sure that the product was working well and it was and since I've got these it's just been phenomenal so me personally I suggest y'all try it out if you want to like I said next time I have another product that I'm going to be reviewing by funky farms and so hopefully y'all stick around for that one so with these the pineapple Express the Sour Diesel and then the Northern Lights by just CBD and I also suggest checking out their website I'll put the website in the link in description down at the bottom so that y'all can check it out but if you are having any problems like let's say tired anxiety the or any other symptoms that you can find on the on ano zone there is CVD that might be out helping CVD can work for you or it cannot there are lots of products that are out there and it just takes time to find the right product that y'all are looking for I highly suggest if you are getting maybe like discouraged or anything don't give up on trying the product don't give up on on find the right one because whenever you find the right one it'll make a world of a difference thank you for sticking around and listening to my review on just CBD on their Signature Series vague cartridges and hopefully I'll enjoy talk to you later", "DZuUFlJo1y0": "okay so I purchased this product about a year and a half ago my husband takes about one day sometimes to Dave he's being one more anxious that day as you think sitting we've gone through a good bit of the bottle he stayed with the gummies tastes really good he likes the flavor they don't taste like medicine or anything like that they are 25 milligrams each which is higher than the 10 milligram ones that I had bought originally and a whole lot cheaper you get a hundred and twenty on this one for one of you five or thirty dollars on these I can't remember now but the other ones I bought was 30 days worth for $60 and that's just crazy expensive to me so these I got a waiting one there's about four months worth of you take one a day and I got way more for a lot cheaper at least give me one a try but don't don't try it for like a day or two later okay no it doesn't work if you have to you do have to give it some time to like build up in your sister on things like what he does when he takes them is he puts one in his mouth and puts it in his cheek and lets it sit there for about five minutes or so just trying to get some medicine into his system later faster by swallowing it and stuffing it already being like a juice and then he chews out the rest of the gum and after about five minutes and then he eats it so yeah I would definitely recommend this product yeah", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud

everyone I just kind of wanted to make this video I'm going to be doing an eyebrow tutorial not really like a tutorial like I am NOT a new guru I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing kind of like an eyebrow tutorial slash edible review slash me just [ __ ] around so I am getting ready because my brother is performing down on sunset today and I have to get ready because I'm going to go and support him Josje oh sure my eyebrows or something that's like really important to me like in high school if I didn't wear makeup at all I at least had my eyebrows build it that's the most important thing your eyebrows shape your face like there I just can't stress enough they're just one of the most important things as far as your makeup routine so I am going to be reviewing I have some kiddo candied pineapple flavored sativa gummies I have never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with

(upbeat music) Good morning y'all, rough morning. I honestly was not planning\nto pick up the camera until I was feeling a little better, but something adorable happened. Harlow, while you are adorable, I'm actually not talking about you. I managed to make it downstairs, and I found this from Judd. This is gorgeous. Got a sailboat, a pink sunset, wow. This is so touching, it says, the card says, with you,\nlife is an adventure, happy Valentine's Day. And he wrote the sweetest most amazing... I'm not gonna share what he\nwrote 'cause it was personal, but you know this is\nnot typically like Judd, the romantic gesture, so I know he put a lot\nof thought into this and, I've got a great man. Alright I have made it to my destination. I need the heating pad, I\nneed my nausea to go down. I will see y'all in a bit. Hey Harlow, you wanna be snuggled, and your nose is like right in my armpit. Well y'all I am feeling a bit better. Harlow actually slept on our\nbed all night last night. Usually she'll get up after awhile 'cause she gets too hot, but I woke up and she was happily\nlaying between Judd and I. She was actually kind of invading Judd's space and like pushing him, so that Judd starting\ncoming into my space. But we made it work. Anyways I've got a\nphysical therapy session and the PT should be here any minute now. And then I'm going to\ntry something new today. Alright I had my physical\ntherapy, it went well. The first thing he asked me is, \"Do you have your AFO's yet?\" And I said no, but my appointment, I'm not sure if I told y'all yet, is Friday to get my AFO's and my joint braces from Hanger Clinic. So, looking forward to that. Anyways as a Valentine's Day treat, I am making Judd some pulled pork, one of his favorite things. The last time I tried to make pulled pork, it went not so great. I cooked it on high instead of low, so the pork really didn't shred well, but I think this one's\nready to be shredded. Oh my goodness, yes, it's\nshredding beautifully. Okay so the secret is to\ncook it on low for six hours instead of high for three hours, ta-dah! Alrighty, so I shredded it up, I put some of this sauce in it, and I actually have a\nrecipe to share with y'all 'cause I was like if I mess this up again, I wanna blame it on a recipe. So I put a link to it in the description, and then I added some Sticky\nFingers Carolina Sweet, and I think he's gonna love it. Alrighty y'all, I said I\nwas trying something new, and here it is. This is my very first shipment of CBD oil. So I've been talking with my\ndoctors about my chronic pain, and we are always looking for new ways to improve my quality of life, and to help me manage my pain, and it had been suggested\nto me to try CBD oil. And if you wanna learn about\nmy pain management plans and past discussions of this, I would check out my\npain management playlist. So originally, I was\nopposed to trying CBD oil because I was worried it\nwould lower my blood pressure, and I already have problems with that. I have to take medications\nto keep my blood pressure up, but I think that was just me\nnot knowing much about CBD oil. Some people it doesn't do anything to BP, some people it goes up, down. We don't know exactly how\nit's going to affect me, but I talked to my pain\nmanagement doctor about it, and he thinks it's at least\na try 'cause many people have had a lot of success with CBD oil, and if it helps me, how\nwonderful would that be, especially since it is natural. Now I did a fair amount\nof research on CBD oil before deciding to do it, and before deciding which company\nI was gonna purchase from, and one of the first\nthings I learned is that many people have very strong opinions on which company is the\nbest to purchase from. And what I think will be\ntrue in this instance, is that every brand can\naffect everyone differently, and you really need to do a little bit of trial and error to see\nwhat works best for you. So the company I decided to go with first is one that a fellow EDS blogger uses, her name is Christina Dougherty, and this company is called Theramu. And if it works well for her, I felt confident in giving it a try to see if it works well for me. Now CBD oil may do nothing for me, I know a lot of people\nhave success with it, but I have spoken with some people who said it really didn't do much. Or it did very little that it\njust wasn't worth the cost. So I am moving forward with\nthis, cautiously optimistic. I really, really want it to work, but I'm not going to get my\nhopes unrealistically high. I like my saying of cautious optimism. If this one really doesn't\ndo anything for me, like I said, different brands\nmay affect you differently, so I will probably try\nat least one more time with a different brand. I was looking at Lazarus\nor Bluebird Botanicals, those look good 'cause they\nhave third party testing on their products, but anyways, this is what I have right now. So this is... It just came in this box, this\ndoesn't fit in our mailbox so they delivered it\nto the leasing office. It was fine, it came with my receipt, and this pretty stuff that looks like, I don't know hamsters would use it, or like birds for nests, whatever. Packaging I guess and\nit came with this box. Now it's open because I\ndid try it last night, I put a drop on my skin first because, you know me, I'm\nprone to allergic reactions, and after awhile, nothing\nhappened with the drop on my skin, so I put one drop under\nmy tongue and went to bed, and I was totally fine. I wanted to try it first last night because, well, that's when it came in, but also Judd was home,\ntoday he's working. And so you open it up,\nand here is the oil. It was facing the right\nway when I first opened it. And I got the Theramu Calm Pro. Which I think just means it's a higher strength\nthan their original. And it is mango flavor,\nand 100% pure hemp extract. Sublingual dietary supplement. 750 milligrams pure hemp extract. And this is one ounce. Supplemental facts, serving\nper container, about 120. Serving size is five drops. So I get one drop under my tongue. The dose would be five. Other ingredients, pure Emu oil, organic mango extract, it's gluten free. Directions say shake well before use as pure ingredients naturally separate. Place five drops under\nthe tongue subliminally. Up to three times a day or as recommended by your\nhealthcare practitioner. Hold under tongue for 20\nseconds before swallowing. Store at room temperature. Does not contain THC. So yes, I'm using CBD oil,\nthere's no THC component which is the component\nthat makes people stoned. And this is legal in all 50 states. If you wanna know about\nprices for this specifically, just check out their website, I'll link it in the description. That's kind of what I worry\nabout, it being cost-prohibitive 'cause it is kind of pricey, and depending on how much\nI need it, but we'll see. I don't even know if it's gonna work yet and some people say it has\nto get into your system, so it takes awhile to\nstart seeing affects, or it works right away. I didn't notice any difference\nyesterday from my one drop, but, oh I forgot to shake it. So we're gonna shake it up. Alright, I got my drops. I'm gonna like open my mouth and use this while y'all are watching me okay. So here we go. And then I leave it under my\ntongue for like 20 seconds. You really can't taste anything, it doesn't really taste\nlike anything to me. Maybe like a hint of mango, but... Has it been 20 seconds yet? Okay I left it for like 30 seconds 'cause I wanted to be safe. But there we go, we shall\nsee how it affects me. No difference yet. (laughs) But I will keep y'all updated\non my journey with CBD oil, I am really, really hoping and praying it will be a good resource\nfor me, but time will tell. Hi y'all, I've made it into bed. I honestly do not feel a\ndifference with the CBD oil. However my pulse is giving\nme lots of issues tonight. Generally my heart rate is 110, 120, 130, so still tachycardic, yes\nmy pulse gives me issues, but it looks like my baseline. Not tonight, I am up in the 160's and Harlow alerted to me twice today, one syncopy I was able to prevent, by laying down and elevating my feet, the other one I couldn't even prevent it, so, I mean I'm okay. Harlow alerted, I was in a safe place, but (sighs) my pulse is bad tonight. And it started to get worse like two hours after I took the CBD oil, but I don't feel the CBD\noil is making my pulse worse because I was having issues\nwith it this morning. And just the nature of the beast I guess. With the CBD oil, I talked to Judd, and kind of our game plan, is that I'm going to finish\nthe bottle from Theramu. The current bottle I have,\nI'm gonna take five drops in the morning and five drops at night. I watched the video. I edited the volume a little bit, and I think I put way more\nthan five drops in my mouth. It's kind of hard to tell, but anyways, I'm going to take it in\nthe morning and at night until the bottle finishes. If I don't see any difference with it, then I will try another brand and I've decided I'll\ntry Lazarus Naturals. And you know I wanna\nreally give it a good try, I'm really hoping it can help me. Also, if y'all have\nbeen watching the news, I'm sure you know that something really tragic happened in Florida. There was a shooting at a high school and it happened in Parkland, which is several hours South from here, but, gosh, it's hard to\nknow exactly what to say when these things happen. It's heartbreaking and\nwe feel it, I'm sure, all through Florida and\nthrough this nation, and my prayers are with everyone affected. Snuggling Harlow close to me tonight. She's also very attached to me because I'm not feeling\nwell with my pulse. I'm actually gonna be running\nan extra liter tonight to hopefully help with it\nso when I wake up tomorrow I'm hopefully not struggling as much. Anyways, I'm going to bed, so with that I'll say goodnight, and thanks for joining\nus on our adventure. (upbeat music)", "RjOpejjgug8": "what's up guys steve here with ian a 5-star vapor lounge he is the manager here and we are going to be talking to you today about the five things that you need to know about CBD [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the first thing that we want to talk about number one what a CBD and is it legal we all know the medicinal benefits of cannabis the main two components in cannabis the main two cannabinoids are THC and CBD CBD is a way to get all the health benefits and the medicinal properties of cannabis without having to sacrifice your your your cognitive state in a way that might you know hamper your work ability CBD actually has most of the same medicinal benefits of THC but just without the high and it's the medicinal stuff that is in a more concentrated form yes like you're not getting as much CBD yeah from traditional okay yes smoke so you got cannabis and you got him so cannabis is actually very strong very concentrated in THC a very low concentration of CBD industrial hemp is actually very high in CBD but very very low if not anything of THC so actually a lot of the CBD comes from industrial hemp it actually doesn't come from cannabis lucky for us and lucky for a lot of people that are that need the medicinal benefits of cannabis while CBD legality can vary from state to state CBD is not only legal in Missouri but it's also legal on a federal level they actually just passed a new farm bill that was an update from the 2014 farm bill completely removed it from the controlled substance act is it legal yes however do be smart about it this stuff especially our flour and our pre-rolled items do look a lot like the quote unquote real deal so I recommend that the customers leave that in the package until they arrive at their home if it does feel a little disjointed yeah studies have shown that CBD reduces pain inflammation anxiety depression migraines seizures IBS psychosis and mental disorders and nausea so thirdly how is CBD take it you have sublingual sublinguals are a quick way to get in your bloodstream usually just drops under the tongue topicals creams balms there's even patches that are great for muscle and joint pain then you have your pills pill form is great capsules really quick and easy way no hassle no frills way to take CBD then you have your edibles edibles are delicious there's all different kinds of edibles vape available form of CBD can be great for somebody who's already using an e-cig or already has a vaporizer that they're using on a daily basis and when it comes to flower we have the jars of loose flour we have the roll-your-own kit that has the filters and papers included and then we have the pre-roll we have regular pre-roll and then we actually have a Keith and honey rolled pre-roll concentrates concentrates include wax shatter crumble any sort of concentrated CBD isolates and CD is also pet safe there are specific products designed just for pets you could also take a sublingual that's meant for human consumption and give that in small doses to your pet either through their water or in their food meow the fourth thing is how much CBD do I take we always recommend in your starting dose you should usually start about 25 to 50 milligrams and then kind of go from there start a little smaller work your way up and just see what works for you it's not uncommon for people to take upwards of a hundred to two hundred you can't really overdose on CBD so take it you know if you want to start at a hundred start at one hundred if you think that's what you're gonna need one good thing to know if you are using any kind of sublinguals or anything like that with the dropper most droppers are one mill per dropper so you can figure out hey I've got a 30ml bottle it's got a thousand milligram of CBD and you just divide that a thousand by 30 mils and that's basically how much each dropper will be so the fifth and final thing that we're going to talk about will I pass my drug test with CBD yes you will however some CBD products do have trace amounts of THC in them the legal limit for CBD products is 0.3 percent or less THC a lot of the products that we carry are 100% CBD pure CBD or isolates isolated zvt if it says full spectrum that's where you get into that gray area where yeah I'd include something like that and the flower and and yes again it's very trace amounts but if you are using CBD on a regular basis at all I would recommend sticking with isolates and pure CBD and stay away from the flowers and the multi spectrums in the full spectrums now quality is a huge factor know where you're getting your stuff from know where your shops getting their stuff from if you're into CBD at all you know the names like green rose and fresh leaf and summit stuff like that that's what we carry so it's all lab tested most products aren't only just lab tested they're double and triple lab tested and keep in mind even if you're at the point three percent you're not gonna get high from it on the other hand if you're not getting drug tested the multi spectrums are fantastic they have what they call an entourage effect because you're getting all those camp cannabinoids to work together all that synergistic stuff going on aside just all they say all the harder right pretty role in the flower stuff it's some of the best stuff for anxiety and insomnia sleep disorder sleep IDI is an excellent way to go for for anxiety alright guys thank you so much for watching I am Steve this is Ian we are at 5-star vapor lounge in st.

we've actually reviewed a few products from them um i know we've done a couple of carts and live resin where they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all

actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "Zo-UuhBoGJc": "what up guys Jimmy here and I'm reapplying this video of me vaping YouTube deleted I guess for some reason I don't know why they didn't give me an explanation but here it is enjoy what up guys James here and today we're talking about vaping let's go so I got into vaping just because I wanted to try it out and it's a really cool hobby this is a smoke X proof it's a great little mod it looks really cool I've got a rebuildable deck atomizer inside the the prince tank this is a TF v12 prince tank check it out I'll do review I'll do all kinds of videos on that but today's video is on CBD so I started trying out CBD oils like contacted hemp pumps and they sent the ton of samples for me to try and to show you and I can tell you right now they are very good they don't have any weird earthy taste these are 75 milligrams but they go up to like four thousand milligrams which is just crazy and it's really cool because they also have gummies and just the plain additives in case you want to you know add to your own eliquid you can do that and they have a few other liked inter drops as well so hep hep bombs it's not just a liquids they have a ton of products definitely check them out in the link below after about two weeks of trying them all are you ready my favourite hemp bombs CBD he liquid flavor is crisp honeydew melon this stuff is very good I'm actually I've been vaping it the most and I'm gonna tell you right now they have a cookie flavor and then the melon is like right here for me like they're both pretty much right back to back and it yeah they vape very well sweet almost has a bubblegum flavor to it and the honeydew actually sticks out very very well and I'm gonna say this like I can vape this all day long I don't have any irritation and it's only 75 milligrams which is kind of low but if it was a higher dose you know because I'm just getting started that might put me to sleep really quick so 75 milligrams this tiny tiny tiny there's no THC there's no weird additives to it it's very good stuff high quality but I will say this the wild berry jam I wasn't a fan of okay kind of tasted kind of weird the watermelon was amazing the Kush what is it called exotic exotic watermelon cush that was incredible the Arctic spearmint blast that's kind of a good flavor but you know once you put it in your cotton it's always gonna taste like that so you really have to dedicate you know one tank to this but it's very very good my second favorite flavor is fresh farm strawberry milk I don't know how they pull it off but they do the milk is like super creamy and that's just a very very good blend so there's there's a ton of options there's you know they have the cookie flavor which I also love and so you know they have dessert flavors fruit flavors and even spearmint so if you have like even a just an interest at all I think hep balms is a great place to start again tin sure's gummies they have a liquid additives so my one of my favorite flavors is cheery cheery hose and so I don't have the additive but I could just put a few drops in here and that would make it you know a great all day solution so definitely check out hemp bombs there's a great coupon code below where you can use my coupon code and if you guys have any questions let me know it kind of just makes me kind of tired a little bit it's kind of a relaxing it's great when I'm watching TV if you had a higher dose that might actually be more beneficial depending on what you you know kind of like what are you what you're doing it for some athletes they do it for muscle relaxation some people do it for sleep and you know instead of doing sleeping medication they can just vape it or do drops I think vaping might be better for sleep because it affects you quicker where's the drops I've heard kind of take longer to absorb into your cells but it's all good it's all really good I mean I think CBD is kind of it's really popular right now for a very very good reason as you can see it vapes are very very well and again Chris probably do mountain is my favorite so definitely check the link below where you can get more information and again if you guys have any questions let me know and also let me know have you tried vaping before because it's very very different than what I thought it would be it's actually pretty fun so thank you guys for watching and have a great day", "Z4linJwRamE": "what would that that [ __ ] kick in ooh no sorry but without that again what's up we

better than my other one this one actually has a resealable ziplock remember the last one they don't have a resealable and I said it should this one it does stepped up man smells pretty good I want to be like to see it smells like it smells like chair like fruit punch pre-workout or kool-aid I guess yeah you see it so I supposed to be 5 summer so it supposedly 5 sour gummies but that's how that day

you know you can you can't fight off 50 people vote that's that's insane let's think about the same thing for John wait you can't shoot 50 people you ever play time crisis in the arcade or any shooting game y'all get tired but we can't just be doing like this all day so I know I said insane but the movie was still good watch it let me know what you thought and is it you know will it be weird they continue to a part for because you know for three sequels for c3 c4 sequence whatever for four parts of one movie is insane like what's-his-face Denzel Washington never does a sequel except for equalizer too until the end up sided off stay tuned I'm at like subscribe did you sell some ham Zilla tell me what you think I think was worth it and they get it it is due duties no get it I think he did his job was worth it and let me know if it worked for you", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "_qNbztygtRI": "[Music] what's up gentlemen today I want to talk about a hot topic something that you guys have been probably hearing a lot about and that is CBD oil now big disclaimer right up front I'm in no way shape or form at all recommending that you take CBD oil this is something that you've got to do your own research you've got to decide whether or not it's right for you alright today I just want to share with you my experience and what I have found as a result of using CBD oil every day for the past seven months these are my bottles of CBD oil a few months ago back in April I did a video talking about my nighttime routine in that I sort of told you that I was starting to experiment with CBD oil and I was liking the results but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts I did that last video back in April about trying CBD I got tons of companies reaching out saying hey do you want to try my CBD do you want to try our CBD do you want to try our CBD the issue with CBD in this industry something that you're going to find out if you start exploring and experimenting is that anybody and their mother can create a private-label CBD company there are a lot of companies out there that manufacture hemp or that grow hemp that are like oh let's get in on the CBD market and their private labeling the stuff and so there are so many tons of different brands out there now the big issue is that you have no idea what you're taking you have no idea of the potency the strength and with CBD it is my personal opinion that you got to know what the hell you are actually taking a lot of these I would say the majority of these CBD companies out there you really have no idea and the only way you're going to be able to figure out dosage and if something's working and what you can change is if you have a super pure form of CBD oil and you actually are buying it from a company that is like in the business of standardizing things testing things and making sure that the product that they're giving you is pure and plant therapy is a company that's been around for years I have known about the because they specialize in essential oils and oil therapies and that is why the company plant therapy is my choice and my partner for this video I've been using plant therapies CBD oil for the past four months they're in the business of oils and extracts and making sure that the quality is there the transparency is their plan therapy is the best in the business in my opinion I have tried a lot of other CBD brands and I noticed the biggest difference when I was actually able to know what specific dosage I was taking and then monitor it and adjust it from there the plan therapy extracts are pure they do the research they cite all of their research guys they have done an amazing job cutting out all the [ __ ] and making sure that they are providing you incredible information something that I asked them to do for you because there are so much information out there when it comes to CBD oil on our landing page down below they have three sections that I encourage you to go and check out if you're thinking about experimenting or trying CBD oil number one is the frequently asked question you've got a question about CBD oil chances are somebody else has had that question it's going to be listed there along with the answer there's also going to be a section about the proposed benefits of CBD oil and then there's also and this is something that's incredibly important the serving chart so that you know sort of what you're taking how to sort of structure a plan that's going to be right for you and if after and only after you do all of your research you decide that you want to try CBD oil guys you will not go wrong buying from plant therapy we have a discount code there are also three different strengths there they have three different flavors you've got natural you are like unflavored you've got cinnamon and you've got pina colada I am a fan of the sentiment and the natural just doesn't really taste like anything that's it now let's talk about my experience with CBD alright so about seven months ago I decided it was finally time for me to try CBD oil I had been suffering with a little bit of anxiety I've also been suffering from some injuries from working out I've always slept like really good but three benefits primary benefits that you hear people reporting from trying CBD oil is sleep anxiety and sort of like inflammation now the reason why those three things are so like reported when it comes to CBD oil is what CBD oil is now I'm not going to attempt to try and explain what a cannabinoid is and how you've got different receptors like in your brain and in your body that's part of like the endocrine system I'm not going to go into the whole independent how cannabinoids work but if you are interested in learning why CBD oil is actually effective for treating certain things guys hit our link and go read sort of the FAQ s and more about CBD oil and how it really works but at the end of the day about seven months ago I decided I was going to give it a try for one is anxiety I have been a little bit stressed lately and not like feeling like myself and so I was you know like hey if this can help a little bit with anxiety and kind of just like take the edge off I'm good um the other thing is sleep now I typically sleep very well but I was like hey if it can improve my sleep I know that sleep is like one of the most important things that you're going to do during the day or during the night that's going to help you with so many other things and the other thing is inflammation I have been suffering because I exercise like all the time and I use my body hard I am always dealing with like some type of injury and I had something called plantar fasciitis for a few months and probably started about I don't know probably nine months ago and it just wasn't getting any better and it was a bit debilitating and so I'm like alright I got to try something because what I'm trying is not working and I did not want to go to like a position and just get like shot with like a cortisone shot or something like that I am a firm believer that nature can heal us but I'm not like some like crazy over-the-top like weirdo like never use like antibiotics and definitely get your vaccines but I am a believer in in nutrition I'm believer in supplements and taking multivitamins and vitamin b-complex and C and d3 like I believe in all that stuff I grew up on it I was in the nutrition industry for a long time and it's just something that I personally believe in for me and so I decided to give CBD oil a try I went to one of my buddies who was sort of in the business I'm like yo can you hook me up he's like yeah and so he sent me this I'm like all right I had no idea what I was doing but I was like all right I'm gonna try this at night now something else you need to understand they're really two types of different CBD oil there is full spectrum and there is broad spectrum CBD full spectrum means that it also has THC THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high now in CBD oil that is full-spectrum it is a very low dose like I think legally it has to be like under like 0.3% and and I could be wrong about that in order for it to be sold legally but I didn't want to take anything with THC I don't smoke weed personally not that I have anything against it I know a lot of people some of my best friends some of my loved ones absolutely do smoke weed it's just not something that I like I don't like the way that it makes me feel and so I decided to go with a broad spectrum full spectrum CBD has everything including a little bit of THC I didn't want that and so I went broad-spectrum and so I got my bottle I was like all right he's like yo use one dropper I'm like all right I had no idea what milligram I didn't know anything about that but at night before I went to bed like after I brushed my teeth and did all that I took a dropper under my tongue held it there under my tongue for about a minute swallowed it and that first night I slept like a frickin rock was it the CBD I had no idea all I knew is that I slept like a rock I'm like damn I slept like super sound I didn't sleep longer but when I woke up I felt just like invigorated I felt like I got more sleep than I actually did and so I'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what I did boom exactly again and guess what I slept like a rock so month number one through three I took it one time a day at night before I went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety I didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis in my body it's still eight and so I really didn't notice anything there and then once I started doing more research I realized that a lot of people are saying that you need to take CBD oil actually twice a day and so when I started with actually I started with this one therapy I started with the lowest dosage 16 milligrams or 16 milligram milliliters 500 milligram bottle like I said guys if you have no idea about dosage that link down below there's a chart that actually will talk you through sort of how to start using this and trying it and all that's good stuff anyway took it at night but then what I started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after I got done exercising I started taking it again and almost immediately I felt this like it was weird I felt this just like calmness and I'm like could it be like the CBD oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and I was chill I felt better and then I'm like alright I really got to test this out and so then the third day I didn't take it and I I don't know like I said I don't know if it was placebo effect I personally don't believe it is because I was like I was chilled I felt good I wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after I started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better I wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now I'm not saying that everything is linked I'm not saying that CBD oil cured everything but I know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that I got from plant therapy actually upped the dosage to thirty three milligrams with a thousand milligrams bottle and and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly I'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy CBD I feel better than I've felt in a really long time and I was a bit skeptical from from the first time I started hearing about CBD am I you know like I was like okay this is just a fad this really doesn't work and so going into it being a skeptic and really taking my time over the past seven months and sort of analyzing and trying different dosages and and and different amounts like I feel like I have like my formula for me and I'm going to continue to take CVD oil because I truly feel for me it was beneficial and I feel great and so I just wanted to do this video and kind of share my opinion my opinion is for me I feel like it's made a big difference for me I'm gonna keep doing it but I don't know I mean you've got to decide for yourself like I said there's a ton of information out there there also a ton of brands you've just got to be careful you've got to make sure that the brand that you're buying is pure you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you don't just like try like one milligram this day and one milligram that day and just like all over the place typically you don't just try something once and feel like amazing for me I don't know if it was placebo effect I don't know if it was the CBD oil but I noticed the difference my anxiety I noticed that immediately my sleep but regardless of if it was possible effect or not I don't care because I feel better I just wanted to do this video I told you that I would back in April when I sort of mentioned that I was starting to use CBD oil and seeing some positive results for me I'm gonna keep doing it for me I love it for me I truly feel like it's been a bit of a game changer in my overall well-being in health I don't know what the long-term effects of CBD oil is I don't know that it's been out long enough there could be adverse effects I have no idea but I know that for right now you know I I dig it and I encourage you that if you're somebody who struggles with something of you know sleep anxiety or maybe you know pain or some issues but but there are other things right because you know this endocrine system it's like a collection of like glands and it regulates hormones and just makes everything in your body work better and so do your research like I said there are other reported benefits but these were the three most reported and the three that I was interested in seeing if it would actually have an effect on me but at the end of the day guys you've got to decide for yourself do not do it because I'm doing it do it because you want to you have to do your research", "ybAKyhzuY5s": "20 20 chambers in today's video we're going to be taking a look at wild gummies specifically we're going to be looking at their indica hybrid and sativa gummies wild is a company that is based out in the pacific northwest and their focus is to bring what their great surroundings offer to their users if you live in california you can go on wild's website and find an authorized retailer near you i got mine from leaf and lion leaf and lion is a dispensary located at long beach california one of the best things about wild gummies is that all of them are going to be made with real fruit marionberry is going to be their indica huckleberry is going to be their hybrid and raspberry is going to be their sativa all of them contain 100 milligrams in the packaging and each individual gummy is 10 milligrams first we'll taste the indica uncle berry is good i say sweeter than the marion berry for sure huckleberry huckleberry is my favorite for sure so i've tasted a lot of cannabis gummies and i'm very particular about two things texture and the cannabis aftertaste and in my opinion wild gummies pass both of my tests wild gummies are actually gummy like chewy and there's little to no cannabis aftertaste at all when you eat them wild also has a line of cbd enhanced gummies as well and i'll review those in another video as always make sure the cannabis you are purchasing is lab tested and i'll see you guys in the next video", "MhrJHGTpnpI": "welcome to Kois corner a channel for personal and spiritual growth if you enjoyed this video please feel free to like subscribe and leave me a comment letting me know why a few weeks ago I did a video on CBD and how it really helped my life at a time where I could have gone down a negative path due to things I was dealing with and YouTube removed it they took it down they struck it they gave it a strike even though it's legal compound essentially without explanation which I'm currently appealing but I don't care I want to talk about CBD and specifically the benefits that we can get from CBD the science of it how it can help us because it is a magical magical compound that I think can do so much good so what is CBD well to be completely honest CBD just stands for Kenna video I think I pronounced that right which is one out of over a hundred strains of cannabinoids and cannabinoids are pretty much just chemical compounds that share the same structure the same derivatives as THC as cannabis as marijuana which we smoked in certain ways and CBD is one of them but it is arguably the most important and most practical for us so before I go any further I got this question on my last video to the CBD that I personally use is by herb strong it's full spectrum CBD a thousand milligrams for this tincture it's my favorite CBD I've tried a few different CBD types this is the one that I work with and that works best for me I don't promote anything really ever on this channel but I will promote this because it works so that's my thing so the reason though CBD is so amazing because like we said it has the same chemical derivatives as THC but it doesn't have all of it so what this means is that all scientific level we can get the health benefits from marijuana without the high CBD is not psychoactive you do not get high from CBD you do not get the munchies your eyes do not get red you don't get any of those leftover side-effects any of those conscious sort of alterations you just get the health benefits and this is why it's so magical because some people understand the health benefits of marijuana but they might not like getting high I know so many people who understand that but don't want to get high and this is the compound for you if that's the case because many jobs drug test many of us play for sports teams which drug tests we can't use these compounds who can't do this we might have legal problems where we can't do that either all these different things can be bypassed so we can get the health benefits that come from cannabis through CBD so essentially CBD is kind of like an under the surface effect or the same way that tylenol works we're taking it for an intended purpose but we're not feeling it as it acts out its own process and that process is interesting to scientifically how the CBD works is that we as humans have awesome awesome bodies so we have cannabinoid receptors in the brain and in the nerves throughout our body so when we take CBD it binds with those receptors and since the receptors aren't just in the mind but are also in the body CBD and the number one benefit which will now get into it is the fact that it is a natural painkiller it is amazing for helping us deal with chronic pain and painful issues with the body I myself got into a motorcycle accident about eight months ago ever since through therapy through everything I'd still had a slight really annoying chronic knee pain because of it that just won't go away and when I use CBD I can notice that pain disappear it's absolutely incredible which saves me for having to use opioids or certain addictive medications with side effects instead I can use something natural and safe that's one benefit that's the physical benefit but it also effects and connects to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain so what this means is that it also works for curing anxiety and depression for helping us alleviate the symptoms that come with experiencing anxiety depression CBD is amazing for this the same reason people smoke weed to relax you can take CBD and get those health benefits too so if you are having problems with anxiety with depression with restlessness of the mind CBD is an incredible place to start to see if it helps you get into that space of peace because when it does then we could try other things to combat it we can try meditation we can try yoga we can try breath work but getting into this space of clarity is best done with a friend and that friend can be CBD in this case along with this on a more serious note CBD also helps people with epilepsy kind of lessen the amount of epileptic events they have it helps patients with Alzheimer's it also works against leukemia and in certain cases which we're starting to study now it actually kills cancer cells slowly in breast cancer that's amazing so CVD doesn't just work with pain management or with anxiety but can also work with serious diseases too now the best part and I think the number one selling point for people with CBD that can be used on a grand scale is the fact that it is non addictive not me just saying it's not addictive but the World Health Organization itself ran a study and agree that CBD is absolutely not addictive in any way can it become something of dependency on a physical level unlike even marijuana which we can depend on mentally she doesn't even have in a six-week study six weeks where every single day multiple patients took 700 milligrams of CBD which is pretty much all that's in here out of a thousand that's probably 700 so imagine all of this every day that's a lot for six straight weeks a month and a half and once they stop the next day there were no physical withdrawals there were nothing zero completely fine as if they had taken nothing at all that's a very rare thing for any compound that can help the body let alone one that has no negative side effects at all really this is why she would be so great for people that have addiction problems that have this kind of extremist attitude toward drugs and I know I'm one of those people when I drink or when I used to smoke or take psychedelics I would just go gung-ho with it fully in all the way CVD doesn't give us a place to worry about that we'd also worry about addiction because there isn't any and CBD hasn't been around for just a short while it's not some new thing we're now discovering CBD was identified in the 1940s that's over 70 years ago but we fade it away from cannabis in the Reagan era with all the propaganda against it with reefer madness even before that and people got on to the opioid movement but now as opioids out numbered as prescription medications specifically outnumber the amount of deaths that illegal medications or illegal drugs I should say such as heroin crack cocaine all these different things to cause deaths first person's cause more so we're looking for a way to get out of that prescription mentality we want something safer we don't want to worry about addiction we don't want to have to worry about getting that fix or about going into the doctors and now being stuck with this drug addiction for life we want to be free from those worries and CVD helps us transcend those scares that is why if CBT is such an incredible compound not just only has all these amazing effect but also keeps us safe from harming ourselves that's incredible that's amazing I really don't know of anything else like CBD currently there are very few compounds which can have such immense benefits and so few negative traits so I highly suggest you check CBD out this is my video on CBD it's really that simple it's cookie cutter it's very straight to the point and whatever research you do you will see that it represents the same exact things that

different factors that play into cbd oil taste and i will talk about all three of them today my name is nadia and i'm holistic nutritionist and i specialize in cbd oil and i'm also a founder of vicaria cbd today let's discuss the flavors of cbd oil there's three different factors as i said that play into it first factor is what kind of cbd it is is it cbd isolate which is just a powder it's just cbd it's like a cbd extract it's just cd or cbd full spectrum so which means um it has a variety of different cannabinoids or it's a concentrate i'm not going to be talking about concentrates they usually come in syringes you can you probably have seen them and it's just literally concentrated it has a very strong flavor to it uh it's bitter and usually most people don't take it that way usually most people take it just in cbd oil so let me give you an example of um fia aquarius most popular cbd oil so first of all cbd isolate versus full spectrum cbd isolate doesn't taste like much by that i mean it actually doesn't taste much at all and if you have however sometimes it can have a little bit of a bitterness to it and that will depend on the second factor whether you feel it or not full spectrum however does have a little bit of a flavor it has a little bit of a weed or cannabis taste if you haven't ever smelled cannabis or smoked cannabis you know that flavor or that taste most people don't really like it however it's not very overpowering it's just a little bit like mostly the smell of it so our most popular theater is made with isolate so you can't actually taste anything at all however there's a second factor of how concentrated the oil is if oil is let's say 500 milligrams in a 30 milliliter bottle you probably won't taste anything if it's isolate however if it's 3 000 milligrams in a 30 milliliter bottle you most likely will taste the bitterness of cbt isolate full spectrum you will taste it most likely either way or at least smell it most likely either way it's not overpowering it's just a little bit of um that as i said weed smell to it and a little bit of a weed taste if it's very concentrated you will taste it more than if it's less concentrated um our fear is 1500 milligrams so it's kind of like a sweet spot that you if it's isolated you don't really taste it if it's full spectrum it's not really overpowering so you can get our fia by following the bio we sell in canada and in us and just use the code youtube to get 10 dollars off and it's our most popular oil i personally love it and there's a third factor that determines how you see video will taste and this is why this oil is the most popular one it's because it the flavor will depend on the carrier oil so there's a lot of different carriers oil carrier oils in the market as i said cbd itself is more like a powder or concentrate so it has to be diluted or it has to be um dissolved in an oil in a carrying oil because it's fat-soluble so thea is mct coconut oil so it's coconut oil that has no flavor no smell it's just has a little bit of like a fatty texture of course it's an oil however there's a bunch of different ones there's hemp oil there's olive oil there's almond oil there is like a whole you know range of there's different flavors mint i've seen pepper i've seen lemon i've seen it's it's just it rains so much and that's what really you will be tasting so um from my experience most people prefer kind of like mct coconut oil no flavor especially if you're taking it at night you don't want to have this flavor in your mouth after you brush your teeth um that being said some people do prefer hemp oil we also have that flavor hemp oil tastes very strong like a very strong olive oil it has bitterness it has earthy flavor and some people really don't find palatable but i personally love it and i have a lot of customers that love it as well it um it almost adds a placebo effect feeling when you were just like hmm i've taken something like it must be working so which i you know i find only that is very powerful think about drinking coffee when you have that soup of coffee you're like oh i feel much better waiting reality coffee doesn't work for 20 minutes i mean let's face it we all know that feeling when you're picking a cbd oil you can know what it will taste like based on those three criterias cbd isolate versus full spectrum cbd what is the concentration the more concentrated the more you'll taste it and what is the hair in your oil as i said from my experience the most popular one is mct coconut oil that has no flavor and people really like it especially if you're taking something every day the the taste like let's say um i don't know lime taste or lemon taste it gets really annoying after a while i find and we get a lot of feedback about how good it is not to have any flavor like to actually have flavorless cbd oil but don't forget full spectrum will have a little bit of that weed to taste just so you expect it um as i said you can buy our cd oil by following the link in the bio use code youtube for 10 off and keep asking questions comment below if you um have any further questions or if you have questions about a specific oil that you want to buy and you want to you know me to tell you exactly how it tastes um as well as don't forget to subscribe and we'll see in the next video", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "OMvL3j3l5vw": "hey everyone caffeine man here and today I got an extremely unique product to go

timestamp video so that people aren't scared away by the twenty to thirty minute video I know I would be when I first saw this product in stores I thought it had to be some kind of gimmick caffeine gummies but I still picked up the product anyway I'm really glad I did I started to read about it and I read about the ingredients that were in there and I said I gotta get this product but but I was a little hesitant because the price I had a little bit of sticker shock for something I wasn't sure about but I really really wanted to try it so I contacted the company to see if I could get some free product in exchange for an honest review spoiler alert I did so thank you to Hilo for sending me some of the gametime gummies to try out for my sister drivers and for personal use of course so who is Hilo well the full name of the company is Hilo nutrition and I'm glad I looked it up because of course I thought it was hi-low but technically it's pronounced Hilo there when they entered the supplement market they wanted to enter it in a unique way they didn't want to have capsules or powders because I don't review powders as you guys know but they went the weight of a yummy chewable gummy form and I like it and one of the co-owners in co-developers is actually an NFL athlete Travis Kelce why would an awesome NFL player be interested in game time gummies well because it's not just game time gummies this company actually start out doing pre-workout gummies the pre-workout gummies have caffeine Petain and beta alanine in them once those gummies became super popular they worked with other ingredients to make some other products as well that leads me into the game time gummies game time gummies not only have caffeine but also has theanine and for all my longtime subscribers they'll know I'm a huge fan of theanine as well as a healthy dose of cognizant but before we enter those ingredients let's take a look at some of the other ingredients in here as well and for that let's take a look at the Supplemental facts panel the serving size is four gummies and the recommended dosage is one serving prior to activity and not to consume more than two servings per day which is eight gummies so when you consume four gummies you're gonna be taking in 45 calories 11 carbs and 6 grams of sugar what are some of the other ingredients to make these gummies well it uses tapioca syrup water sugar natural and artificial flavors citric acid malic acid sucralose and ace k so two artificial sweeteners locust bean gum some tapioca starch yellow five blue one and ethyl cellulose who cares about all those ingredients you guys want to know about the big three and I'm about to tell you first off let's start with the best one wall hunt in my opinion because it's in my name the caffeine for four gummies you're gonna get 100 milligrams of caffeine that's 25 milligrams per gummy all of those of you were terrible at math I mean that's simple math which is easy for me too as for theanine you're also gonna get 100 milligrams which is 25 per cube that's for the cognizant you're gonna get a whole whopping 250 milligrams of cognizance someone look into all those numbers 100 milligrams is a healthy dose of caffeine similar to what you and a cup of coffee a little bit more than an 8 ounce Red Bull as for the Thea need you're also gonna get a hundred milligrams and that balances out well with 100 milligrams of caffeine in general I am a huge fan I love and that's a strong word but I love l-theanine and more so I'm a huge fan when they actually put it in energy drinks why do I love it so much what self theanine do l-theanine is an amino acid it's most commonly found in green tea and black tea and tea is the second healthiest drink on the planet if you haven't heard me say it but l-theanine is one of the top ingredients for mental focus and concentration as well as many other brain functions research has found that those who take 100 milligrams of theanine have made fewer errors and procedures that require attention on its own theanine can help improve a person's attention as well as reaction times but in combination with caffeine it can help improve alertness caffeine is a stimulant so it can help people stay alert but having 50 milligrams of caffeine mixed with a hundred milligrams of l-theanine can greatly improve a person's focus and alertness research has also suggested that theanine may help reduce stress and help increase relaxation which can lower the heart rate in turn this may help lower blood pressure therefore I'm a huge fan of caffeine and theanine being in energy drinks because for my personal needs I use it to stay focused at work as well as what I'm gaming and thus is a great ingredient for gamers as well as anyone that has a job where they need to be alert and focused and I don't know many jobs that you actually get to sleep on besides security guards I'm just joking to all the security guards out there are you true security guys you know that you can't you get some Z's in there sometimes just kidding but overall rather than just having caffeine and drinks that tends to get you a bit hyped up why not have something that balances that caffeine like theanine so we know that this product has caffeine and theanine which I think you're both great but what's this 250 milligrams of cognizant what cognitive in cognizant is a high quality brand name of Sydow choline and what's it a choline citt\u00e0 choline isn't central nutrient that impacts liver function healthy brain development muscle movement your nervous system and your metabolism so the cooling is supposed to help mental energy memory and focus in some studies short-term treatment with Citi choline was beneficial in individuals who had a lower cognition at the beginning of the studies other research shows that taking citta choline might help improve memory learning and the ability to focus better as well as improve some aspects of memory and elderly people choline is a nutrient required to make acetylcholine which is an important neurotransmitter it's involved in memory muscle movement regulating heartbeat and other basic functions this year of transmitter also plays an important role in memory mood and intelligence and it's also important for the process that synthesizes DNA which is important for brain function and development therefore is no surprise that choline intake is associated with improvements in brain function but that's choline what about citta choline well those were two sometimes used interchangeably but let's look at touch closer at this so I don't get any negative comments from all the biochemists out there or sciency people or just the trolls I'd like to try and throw me in the comments almost sort of choline and choline are two different things yeah I know so let's find out what Sidda choline is known as CDP choline this compound has neuroprotective properties and is made up of choline and cytidine Sidda choline helps transport dopamine increasing its release in the brain so for the sake of this video I'll talk about the health benefits of choline because citt\u00e0 choline has choline in it and other stuff so where can you find choline well you can actually find choline naturally in foods a single egg has approximately 150 milligrams of choline and you could also find choline and foods such as Cod salmon broccoli cauliflower several others so what's a good dose of choline it's been recommended that a healthy dose of choline is 425 milligrams for women in 550 milligrams a day for men so if you have the two daily servings of helo gummies you'll be getting your daily 500 milligrams so if you haven't fallen asleep yet from all that boring neurotransmitter kollene brainstuff let's taste them out I'm gonna grab them from up here given the price of these things they only sent me one they're not that expensive I'll tell you at the end that being said you do actually get a lot in here yeah eighty gummies in here let's open them up and take a look so here's the packaging for you what were they smell good mmm I like it get kind of a sour apple smell to him and I'll hold them up to you guys here they are green and they got little bits of sugar or something on them and guessing that sugar so let's taste them out they're so small compared to my normal energy drink reviews mmm it's interesting I'm trying to get the exact flavor again a couple of different things I mean I'm used to taste in energy drinks so when it comes to describing food or candy or gummies it's a little bit difficult so since I'm allowed to have four I'm gonna go for a second one probably editor that would do at a time I have to say I'm getting a little bit of that sour flavor similar like what first time you bite into sour patch which might be the sugar that's on the outside of it and then just a hint of sour again a bit of lime in there which could be why they're green usually the color there's a little bit of a representation of what it's supposed to taste like and it's definitely a gummy and it's not a hard gummy as soon as you bite into it it's almost similar to like a jell-o type consistency so it's a little more jelly than it is like a gummy like a sour patch or a gummy worm or something there's a little bit solid and then when you start to chew these they actually break down in your mouth to almost like a liquid now I do have to admit there is a little bit of an aftertaste to them but I pretty sure I'm just getting a little bit of bitterness from the caffeine and I know that it's the bitterness from the caffeine because I've had it in several of the different gums that I've tried does it make it horribly off-putting definitely not but there are gonna be some people that are sensitive to the bitter taste so they might not like it but that's when you first start chewing it as you start to chew it and it does start to break down you do get a little bit of that bitterness but you get that lime and that sourness as well and once it's completely broken down you're getting mostly the flavor of the gummy there for the sake and getting the whole dosage I'm gonna see if that bitterness stacks after I have all four or if it actually subsides a little bit I know that sometimes with the caffeine I'm that I have the longer that I chew it that bitterness does start to wear off a little bit go home for number three since I'm editing I'll probably go for the fourth one too or I could just chew for at the same time I'm do it two more of the same time oh four and actually while chewing these two I usually I'll probably try and edit the sound a little bit cuz some people don't like the join it's also a nice audience that loves the but when I was chewing two of them at the same time that actually cut down on the bitterness and I did get a little bit more lime flavor to it so if you're gonna try these I recommend not having at a time but maybe you have three or four at the same time should I go ahead and do four at the same time I mean I recommended doing four at the same time the truth is when I first heard about these I was so excited about them because basically I was playing on heaven one like every 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so so that I could get a slow-release of caffeine into my system because that's the way I prefer to have my caffeine intake but if I can cut down on that bitter taste by having all four at the same time I'd probably do that so don't exceed more than two servings per day your one serving is four gummies I just had four gummies so that's one serving in my activity is this YouTube video now for my next activity I should have four more to let you know how that bitter taste is with four at the same time so my second activity for the day is an experiment for you guys for a little energy cubes foia energy cubes Etsy it's funny and gamers will get it yeah you definitely want to have three or four of these at the same time when you have all four you're gonna really get a strong lime flavor you're gonna get kind of a candy flavor based on that sugar - that's in there even though it's not really sweet with sugar only six grams you have the sucralose and the ASX in there as well and when I eat all four of them at the same time I'm barely getting any bitterness so I'm glad I was able to experiment this out for you because after I had that first one and I just ate one I was like oh man these are kind of bitter that stacking effect really worked out having all four of them to barely taste much bitterness at all therefore if you guys are looking for some gametime fuel and all you workers out there who work late night shifts or just few workers who want to have some energy and focus I recommend some game time gummies for you or anybody else that likes to try different caffeinated products I know I'm a big fan of caffeinated products I know on caffeine man so it makes sense I don't like to just get my energy from energy drinks I like caffeine gum I like caffeinated peanut butter on the caffeinated water I had caffeinated water than my tea so I like all caffeinated products if you guys want to try some different caffeinated products I recommend trying the gummies if you're looking to purchase these I'm going to include a link down below it's my Amazon affiliate link I get a small commission from each purchase so only purchase them if you're serious about it because I'm not doing this for money I'm honest in all my reviews I'm upfront about the bitter taste I'm super excited to have these because of the hundred milligrams of caffeine the hundred grams of theanine and the 250 cognizant I'm gonna be trying them out for the next week see how they improve my performance I heard he tried out two doses for today so I'll include my amazon link down below I believe they're 29.99 might be cheaper if you're a Prime member or might be cheaper depending on what

you guys have yourselves a great day or night this neurotransmitter also my dog and yes this hat this sweatshirt was a throwback to an older video of mine making a guest appearance in this video since I recently had my anniversary video I fear I revisit some of the past videos so for anybody that noticed and my hardcore subscribers out there which one you can tell me in what video I wore this outfit let me know in the comments down below and for any of you that get it I don't know I'll give you a heart emoji that's how much I love my hardcore subscribers you", "8H9zrtU3r2w": "hey everyone my name is jenna i'm coming in here to talk to you guys about anxiety today now personally this is something i've struggled with since i've been a small child and i'm sure everyone watching this video has dealt with it at some point in life whether it's you know chronic and you deal with it every day or it's something that comes up that's situational especially with all the changes that are going on on in the world i thought it'd be really kind of beneficial to chat about it and kind of give some tools and tips that have helped me my kids my clients um and all that stuff so let me dive right into it now if you're dealing with kind of anxiety that's right in the moment like you're really hyped up it's really stressful your panic and all that stuff it's really important kind of break that energy in which when you're in that moment in that mindset it's really really hard to do so something that i really focus on that helps me and you know i've given and helped my children with and all that stuff is working with your five senses so your sight your smell your hair your taste and your touch now for me um smell is really something that i go to so it's either either i'm opening up the front door and breathing in that fresh air or kind of working with an essential oil my favorite go-to is vanilla because for me it's just really calming lots of people like to use lavender but again everyone's different with what tool and tip works for them um also listening to something you know you know it could be chanting meditation or even hip-hop and your you know your favorite song that you just want to kind of break it down to and kind of like just get out of that anxious state and that focus where your mind's at um taste is also a really good one either it's um something healthy or something really comforting to you to kind of just instead of focusing on the anxious energy and thoughts going to your senses whatever is working for you also touch is a really good thing for me it's something always soft some people use kind of a hard texture or a rough texture to kind of break up that anxious energy to something else but you know i always say use what works for you everyone's different everyone has different you know stressors and anxiety and situational you know things that come up that bring it to you so it's really important that you kind of fill your toolbox with what works for you now if you're dealing with anxiety like every day whether it's you know kind of not not you're not in panic mode but it's more kind of baseline there and it just it's just what your your system is it's really important to kind of get out of that funk or that you know cycle is going back to the basics and when i say basics is really self-care basics now for me you know that's working on my my sleep working on my healthy intake hydration mindset and a few things that you can do with that is like when you're going to have a shower simple things not complicated and all that stuff but simple things when you're going to have a shower visualize that shower the water coming down is cleansing it cleansing your mind body soul and just really kind of washing away that stressful energy and just kind of letting it you know rinse cleanse all that stuff another thing is listening to meditations when you're you're when you're trying to sleep at night and your your mind's racing put on a meditation i always say guided meditation um because then you're not sitting there trying to think of what think or what not to think about guided meditation kind of makes you focus on their voice and what they're visualizing for me at night time i love somatic drumming that really and the guided meditation behind it it really kind of suits my soul also with hydration make sure you're drinking enough water that is easy to stay but you know it's really hard sometimes for people some people don't like the taste of water and then you can infuse your water with fresh fruits if you don't like that go to a pure juice and kind of infuse your water with that um what else healthy eating you know you don't have to dive in and be like clear out everything and go full hard in but you know have a smoothie in the morning if you don't like smoothies have a salad but just something basic to try to get your system back on a healthier path because living with that anxious energy all the time is really really hard on your system and your mindset um something that's really helped me throughout the year is this personal development listening to podcasts or um or audiobooks i'm not really like i can't really sit there and read a book i'm a mom of three kids can't i don't have time to do that but listening to an audiobook or a podcast while i'm going throughout my day really is helpful you know it kind of really takes me on a different path and it's also very healing um also you know exercise if you can't go out and you know lift weights at the gym or whatever put on a youtube go stretch it out put on music and just dance something to really elevate um your vibrations and kind of shift that energy anxious energy into something that anxious energy wants to move it doesn't really want to sit there too much if you're during the day um it wants to move so it's either dancing cleaning something like that um also really working on your environment if you're in a cluttered environment you know your system is going to kind of react to that if you have a calm clear clean environment your system is going to automatically feel a little bit calmer so again don't fully overwhelm yourself just take baby steps little baby steps because if you think of a ladder right i always give this analogy if you think of a ladder letters have little kind of baby steps to get up if you take those baby steps out of the ladder you're going to have a really hard time to get up there and it's not going to be stable and safe so take those little baby steps and appreciate acknowledge them appreciate them put your blinders on to other people and what they're doing and really focus on your journey and celebrate your baby steps um now one thing for me that's really helped when i was in a really anxious stressed out kind of i'd say dark moment in life um i was really looking for something to help soothe me you know i've tried lots of things and and it just wasn't working so i did turn to cbd oil and the reason why i picked thought cloud basically because there's so many cbd oils on the market right like you could feel overwhelmed of what to pick what's good what's not the reason why i picked um thought cloud is because right away you know i'm a researcher i went and looked on their website and right away um i saw it was reconfused now for me you know someone who is going to get um and going on my reiki journey and becoming a reiki master i saw the recant fuse i'm like whoa you know alignment okay let me look into this company and then i saw you know their reports and how pure and amazing their product is another thing that really kind of got me in there is the owner of the company leo he would go on on live on his instagram or make videos and talk about his day talk about things that he's struggled with and how he's overcome them um and it was really kind of i really enjoyed you know look i looked forward watching his videos every day and kind of connecting with him you know when you look at somebody in the eyes you connect to their soul and their energy and i just i felt like all of those things kind of aligned for me and that was the right company to go go with and i'm so glad i did because three years later i'm still using their products now the main reason why i'm using their products on top of those things are their products are good they work so it's kind of like you know a no-brainer there all those things that made me think okay let me try this company and then you know three years deep and i'm still going hard with them because it's something that i include in my daily practice with nighttime i take their nighttime series that really help kind of calm me and help me sleep so yeah i hope those tips were helpful um if you want to connect and reach out to me i'm on instagram my instagram is optimal journey i also have another instagram that's skin care beauty diy and also if you're looking into you know getting some thought cloud products and testing them out my discount code um for you to save money is discount code skin really simple skin that's it um and yeah so hopefully this video was helpful for you i'm looking forward to whoever wants to connect and reach out and just you know wishing you all the best and namaste thank you you", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "4AIAdjvu4N4": "there's like not even a slight taste Wow hey youtube today we are reviewing spoken by

plus or at least an 8.5 co-host which is a very fine I give it I'm working anyway oh yeah I did [Music] so depending on the flavor but overall I think their flavors are really cool and they have a bunch of different options chances are out of all of their options they're gonna like at least one of the flavors yeah that's definitely a good beginner so yeah I'm just quite exciting [Music] so we're gonna take off we can go on a walk and I have a send rest of our day so you should have a Zen rest of your day to do and comment your favorite [Music] I guess why not just comment your favorite

milligrams can do to you will you even know no all right what would we need to find out you want three more no I'm gonna really well I had a hundred so maybe 200 okay okay so from a flavor perspective though what do you think the flavor was good there's a very very slight hint an earthy tone at the end I think that's the oil okay they could probably pump up the peach a little bit but I'm pump H pump up the peach yeah I'm glad that wasn't overly sugary though it had a good shoe - a good texture good product your name for the record Jason all right so I have a little thing I'd like you to do
