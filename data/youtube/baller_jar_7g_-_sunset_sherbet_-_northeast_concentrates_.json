have the terps listed again i thought it would but you'll have to go check it out on the moxie pen instagram page they do have it there just look for the post that has a stack of these boxes and it'll have a swipe for the full turret profile uh yeah it's not as high as like you know some rhythm and stuff but i'm very pleased so let's go in for another happy dab shall we another happy dab little moxie 710 hooking it up like i'm oh i'm i'm just so happy with this purchase i don't like i said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth it's truly a unique flavor i don't even know how to really describe it to be honest with you i just really like it it's sweet without being overpowering it's not so mildest to be unnoticeable but not so strong is to be just crazy in your face nice happy medium for flavor very smooth no throat burn not really any tickle i do enjoy that i'm already getting a nice buzz going to dab in and i'm i'm happy now to be fair i did vape a bowl of flour before i did this but that's it that doesn't really affect me like dabs do i don't do flour that often so it's definitely the jesus og kicking in which is sweet i'm glad i did it worth every penny so with that said thank you very much for tuning in for watching i appreciate all the support i've been getting all the feedback it's been awesome uh instagram facebook all of it i hate facebook so i don't get on there don't even bother but here on instagram are the places to interact and you know the support's

the opportunity to get it i'm glad i got a good deal on it i'm grateful for the quality of it so not very often i can be this positive in all of a video um from start to finish and i i again i was nervous i didn't know what to expect because everybody's been on this oh it's good oh it's bad i do it my way my opinion my thoughts my feelings that's just what it is you don't like it kick rocks other than that i appreciate you all being here again i had an awesome 7 10. that is that's outstanding um i'm gonna take my time with this one but uh [Music] oh man i feel good i'm relaxed i'm not

"xU1y9mX6jio": "here we go what's good YouTube welcome to another live stream can already take a few dabs and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted

than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my

[Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music]

scrumptious creme cheese fuego only yo that's trippy these are all eight you", "A_kxN5PQQls": "don't you hate it when you can't scrape all the hash out of your little stupid container there's a dab left in here but I can't even scoop it out not with this thing anyways but I'm about to show you a super easy way to get every last bit of hash out of every one of your containers this is gonna save you so many doubts right now on the stream answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed what's up i'm matt welcome back to the strange show this is a channel for adults and patients where i answer all the questions you've ever had about weeds you don't know how many of these little containers like this or maybe even worse the even smaller ones like this that i've thrown away that still have some hash inside of them a long time ago i never knew how to get the last dab or two out of these things and it would drive me crazy until i learned how to make a turn to tell me Tyler showed me this so shout out to Tyler thank you buddy this saved my life all three of these containers are pretty much empty I can't get any more on my stick but after we make our Terp tube we're gonna have a few dabs of these guys so super easy you really don't need a couple things first get all your containers that you have that still have just a little bit of hash in them then we're gonna need a drinking straw a pair of scissors and you probably already have your torch handy but we might not even need this first just cut off a few inches of your straw just make sure the piece you cut off is at least a few inches long now we're gonna take the piece that we cut off we're gonna cut a really steep angle on one side of the straw like this now that we've cut at this really steep angle we're gonna cut the pointy side off right there so it's nice and flat on the front and it looks like a little shovel now we have a very flexible tool to scrape our container with and it's hollow and you're gonna see why that's important in just a second but look how good it scrapes this out I mean it gets every drop there's nothing left in this that looks brand-new now and I can do that to all of these I could go around the house and find any of these I might have and try this and it even works in these little tiny ones because the Turk tube is so flexible that it just bends to any shape you smush it to so if your hash isn't as wet is these are if it's too hard to scrape with your turkey that's when your torch is gonna come in now if you have a hairdryer laying around I'd probably use the hairdryer first but you're probably like me and you're sitting here it's all your dabbing stuff in front of you and I don't have a hairdryer in front of me - dad what so I'm gonna use a torch so just take your torch and just barely wand it over your hash container and just gently heat it up just ever so slightly then it should be a little more runny and wet and pliable and you can do that with your torch or a blow-dryer or whatever you could probably just put in your pocket for now or anything to make it warm now all our containers are clean and our Terk tube is full of past but it's way down in the tube how are we supposed to give to this out this is why it's good for it to be held just take your scissors and cut right up the middle of your straw now you can get your dab tool and to scoop it right out of it and now we got a big bat dam out of an otherwise empty container now that's tight that's the success Terp - yo buddy don't forget to subscribe for good vibes and I got nuggets of knowledge cuz when you watch the stream show it's like going to weed College [Music]", "5VtO5QZKo58": "[Music] today we're going to show you about canister grinders and why it's good to spend the

the kalama kush the j1 and the nigerian silver i feel like i might have had the kalama kush before maybe not maybe not maybe not okay all right all right y'all let's let's get into the chirp review let's get into the turk review okay we're gonna set the box down we're gonna move the pre-rolls to the side we're gonna move the edibles for later we'll try these later um we're going to we're going to keep the tincture on the table because we might have more of that cray thank you for following the twitter hell yeah man big hell yeah okay let's try these out kamala yep yep it's hers okay so we have two of the caramel cream so we'll put one aside we have four strains to try here we have um here we go check them out okay hold on let me turn the music off here yo what's good everyone today well actually okay hold on let me let me do this again what's good everyone um wait hold on let me think here okay yeah yeah yo what's good everyone it's cosmos and today i'm bringing y'all a terp review from my twitch so this is live on the twitch and i'm gonna be uploading it to the youtube we got some new strains here oh boy they're actually on the table but we got some new strains um by karova right here we got a little goodie bag in from corova and so we're gonna strain review all four of the strains the j1 caramel cream kamalakush and the nigerian silver um we also got some other pretty [ __ ] epic stuff in bicoroba so much love corroba huge shout out for the care package and love we're gonna be trying these products i'll give y'all product reviews on everything that we try from them um i actually just downed a little bit of this thousand milligram tincture right here to start the strain review and we're gonna see uh where it all goes from here so yeah let's uh get into it here and start with uh why don't we just start with the kamala kush right here so we're going to start with the outside of the package you know the corrobor packaging very simple just a box here is just solid packaging we're going to look now i'm careful here and we're going to look at the processor name on the side of the package because if i'm not mistaken corova does outsource most of their extraction this is beehive extract here i don't think i've had anything by beehive extracts before so i'm excited to try this this is og kush phenotype of the kamala kush let's open it and see how it looks okay so from the outside of the the gram it has a solid look taco toker thank you for the follow let's go ahead and slice this open i do like their grams a lot of the containers in oregon they have the screw lids that get stuck whenever they get oil in them these guys have the snap and pop lid so like you just go like oh excuse me there we go yeah so it snaps like to the side and then it pops open okay so this is like um a 50 50 dry wet batter it's not super wet but it's not super dry let me smell it hold on oh [ __ ] yes [ __ ] yes yes oh i just touched my nose to it this is exactly the [ __ ] consistency that you want on just like a solid just like very solid you know not like crazy crazy high end where it's like crazy 50 dollars you know but like around the twenty dollar [ __ ] thirty dollar range you know um yeah it has the terps it's not like a super like cushy smell to it but it's almost like cheesy oh it's mellow too i'm gonna use a dabber to break it up a little bit that way we can get more of the terp smell um i noticed that you know whenever you get a fresh gram it's been sitting there for a minute you know sometimes you don't get that fresh turp smell but if you really mix it up you can get that real the real terp smell wow this this honestly reminds me of something that i smoked like six years ago that i really really liked that being said like it just has like that almost like really rich like old crumble smell to it like i mean old crumble not like it's old but like that you know how crumble used to smell way back in the day whenever it would smell like really [ __ ] good um this kind of has that nose to it it's an interesting nose i can't i can't uh can't see exactly what it is but i'm excited let's take a dab sorry i've just been sitting here with my nose in it this whole time um let's take a dab see where it goes i'll try to i'll try to chain somewhat chain these dabs so the review doesn't end up being like 40 minutes or something but it's probably gonna end up being like 40 minutes or whatever so yeah big cheers trey hell yeah yo mini gun thank you for the follow appreciate you hope your day's been nicely lit over there yeah so i'm i'm excited to try this right here this is the kamala kush okay okay big flower boy i'm gonna have to be smoking a little bit of flour here now now that i got that flour try it out see how it is you know i'm excited to try this i'm excited for sure let me heat it up crazy we got this right here all right check it yo check it check it when i gave it a little mix around there we got a nice look to it um i don't think that i have a feeling that beehive isn't running crc this looks a little bit too yellow to be crc to me i think crc would be a little bit wider and it doesn't have like a crazy citrus terp to the background to it it's possible that it's a pho blend based on the little bit of nose that i get from it but it might be pure butane it's hard to tell let's uh let's take a dab here and see how it goes we've got a nice little little chunker just a tiny bit more here we're going to be taking four dabs here so i'm not trying to kill the whole gram and once because i'm going to save some so that we can record some more videos with them but i also want to get enough so that i can get a very good palatable test to it you know and really just test out that flavor i'm gonna play some songs here um by uh billy marcia fava for this dab billy's the homie i'll link his spotify down in the youtube description for when i put this on youtube and big cheers everyone the kamala kush for the first time you don't even need to go to class just that one's really mellow smooth a little bit of nose burn from the terps i like the terps slightly like earthy like a little bit gassy yeah it definitely does come through with that nose burn on the terps there but it's not like harsh at all but it does burn your nose a little bit okay so honestly um it was really smooth nicely tasty i'm already feeling pretty uh pretty toasted from that dab it's been a minute since i've taken a dab too so like an hour it doesn't taste quite as cheesy as it smells but overall it's good it's good um i wouldn't say it's like the best that i've had you know it's pretty solid but it's not like super super super fire you know i had there's nothing wrong with it but it was it was solid it was very solid you know it wasn't like it wasn't the most fire i'm just being straight up with y'all i'm an honest person you know um it was good um you said i'm not a fan of the [ __ ] yeah i didn't get any film on the mouth no feel my mouth this was kamala kush right here high q plays by corova and that one was it was pretty solid um really smooth you know i have no complaints with it on a scale of one to ten um you know for like budget product under the 30 range i'd give it like photoshop i'm my own director i mean probably like a six or seven you know i mean i've had some pretty damn fire stuff for the same price range it really wasn't bad at all you know and like if it was like well um this was like one of the options at the dyspo you know and it was like you only have a few options i wouldn't not recommend it it's not like it was bad at all but didn't have a chirp that like really stood out to me so yeah i can definitely show it again yeah it's a solid it's solid it's not bad at all yo my when i say something is a six or a seven that's an objective scale like it's actually a solid product okay and five is average so it's solid come on man this jar these jars aren't normally this [ __ ] but this one specifically is a little bit [ __ ] in the house who extracted this so this is um sold under the karova brand but it's extracted by beehive extracts in oregon and if i'm not mistaken these not all of them are processed by different companies but i'm pretty sure that some of these are processed by different extraction companies so i'm extremely excited to put them side by side and then be able to come back to corova and give them some good feedback about which extractor i think would be best for them to continue working with because i have actually told them in the past that there was a couple extractors they were working with that i really didn't like the product and that were making some shitty product out of their stuff so yeah um okay on to the next one we have some caramel cream the caramel cream is extracted by bobsled extracts i just gotta say bobsled is fire as far as i have ever had any bobsled i've had a couple strains from them that were kind of crappy like it was just it felt like the turks were crappy i've had a lot of trains by bobsled that were super far um this one was tested 11 12 20 20. uh so a few months ago and uh let's break open the packaging and test it out have i ever had any dirty arm farms i have tried um some other stuff never impressed it's always their whole company is honestly um just feels kind of a little bit shady with their [ __ ] like selling like crc [ __ ] and like trying to sell to soccer moms is like some boujee [ __ ] and stuff just it all doesn't feel quite right to me and so yeah let's see how this caramel this is caramel cream caramel cream by bobsled is looking good crc is color remediation column is what it stands for okay caramel cream um has a very solid like orange smell to it bro this smells like crc to me it has a really good like floral orange like lime smell to it but it's like that very it's that very slightly stereotypical crc smell with slight floral aftertone to it so this might have actually been some good starting product yeah and i mean i have a lot of crc a lot of what i dab is crc and i have nothing against crc whatsoever zero percent but i think that it can be done in in good ways and in bad ways um like you can over crc something by putting too much media in the columns and whatnot um 110 very very easy to do that so yeah let's go ahead and heat up and test this one out let's try it out so this does have a slight bit of the crc smell but i mean it's wet in the point that it looks like it has a good amount of terps in it and i mean it does have like a floral smell as well to the to the orange like lemon um crc tarp it like the smell of it almost right now reminds me of like [ __ ] like hold on hold up you know what this smells like this smells like powdered lemonade no the yellow gatorade powder dabs of the move for sure yes yeah this smells like yellow gatorade powder not in a bad way that's just what it smells like yes scuba hell yeah hell yeah yeah dabs are just very concentrated forms of cannabis you know so it's gonna be like two or three times um as much whenever you take a dab like for it like hitting you i'd say it's probably all right we're on cool down for this one we got four strains in total to try this is number two out of four we're about to try is the caramel kush extracted by bobsled for corova um coroba unrivaled they hooked me up with a care package with some strains and stuff and we're doing a little strain review trying to give y'all an objective strain review letting you guys know exactly which ones are my favorite terps why i think so which ones are my least favorite terps why i think so um should be straight up with y'all we got we tried the kamala kush last by beehive extracts it seemed like some solid non-crc stuff i gave it a six to seven out of ten not bad whatsoever not crazy impressive of a product either so far this caramel cream has a good smell to it really good wet look um extracted by bobsled which they're pretty solid but the smell to it is like a lemon gatorade powder is what i said the the yellow gatorade powder and so i have a feeling it may taste a little bit like crc but we're gonna see okay straight up whatever happened little dab [Music] [Applause] new speakers forget it in a week where's that brand new single i got chains like mr t but you don't want to try mine turn your whole neck limousine cup of coffee in a magazine i flex real hard awesome it's not harsh on the throat but that one definitely got me as well um a little bit in the nose maybe it's because i exhaled the start of it out of my nose but yeah that was a good dab right there honestly um really smooth really really smooth had the turret burn as well um the flavor i think i need to blow my nose um because i'm just not getting the flavor quite as much as i would like to i think that that one okay let me just blow it i think that i'm getting it um yeah okay i stand by what i think um more what i thought at the beginning the flavor on that one is very mellow um he said i have to blow my nose after every dab i don't blame you i don't blame you the chirps that get you sometimes yeah that one's nice um it's smooth i really like the high from it i'm not gonna lie i think that i like the high from that caramel cream a little bit more than the first one and i have a feeling if i dabbed a lot of that i would just be [ __ ] lit as [ __ ] yo rod thank you for the follow much love much love so that one's pretty solid that uh that caramel cream i'm gonna have to take more dabs of that a little bit later and we'll delve into it more and see if we can get more of the flavor out of it maybe with a little fatter dab or something maybe a little low temp dab and come back to it it was solid um but just not quite as much flavor as i wanted but definitely solid i like the high from it too so overall on that one i give it like a uh a 6.5 to 7.5 it's slightly better than the um corova or the uh the like the kamala kush but um not quite as flavorful slightly better overall just because i think i might like the effects a little bit better like the initial effects but um yeah the flavor isn't quite as prominent all right on to the next one we have some um nigerian silver here and this one is processed by beehive extracts as well um tested 2 9 20 21 so this is some freshy fresh and let's see how it's looking the nigerian silver okay i mean i i even though i got these for free i gotta i gotta show you guys because i know i'm objective i gotta just literally i gotta show everyone because i'm an honest person there is a piece of particulate in here um it's not a very big piece of particulate if this were to happen um normally i would um show it to the stream and then i would take the piece of particulate out and i'd say it's not that big of a deal i don't really care um so that's exactly what i'm gonna do right here okay i got the piece of particulate right here what is this let me look at it hold up it breaks apart so i think it's organic i think it's just a piece of cannabis particulate that wound up in the gram no big deal no big deal [ __ ] happens all the time i've seen way way way way way exponentially worse um [ __ ] uh particular so i'm not worried about that whatsoever let's give y'all a better look here of this gram and then we'll break it up and get the smell going here this one once again is the nigerian silver oh yeah oh [ __ ] yeah oh yeah okay hold on i mean for how dry this one is the smell is amazing um wow nice it's like a slightly wet butter like just like a putty consistency almost like a wet putty oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well i'm excited to try this i'm very very very very very excited to try this one this has an extremely floral smell what's good miss girl how you doing oh very nice sweet funky it has a sweet funk to it nigerian x unknown yeah this [ __ ] smells great i'm really excited to try this honestly let's [ __ ] go yo this is hype this is height let's heat it up dab number three oh i haven't been keeping the dab counter updated hold on we're just gonna hit the three dab updater here in the seven dabs i'm excited i'm excited wow i've been dabbing down pretty fat pretty quick as well because i checked my timer and it's still got like 40 more minutes until that uh temperature should be kicking in or so maybe even a little bit longer i'm curious if any of y'all in the chat or people that in the future see the youtube video have tried corova in oregon what y'all think about it um or elsewhere and what y'all's favorite strain was or whatever favorite product and uh yeah which you maybe liked didn't like about it you know very curious to hear so yeah sounds good panda see you in a bit baby hey what's good toes how you doing man what's good what's good we're just doing a little strain review over here for some new corova strains that they hooked it up with giving a little objective feedback on them letting y'all know what i think about them and they're testing out some of their products pretty stoked on it pretty stoked on you're on your lunch break nice toes the day's definitely lit over here so far how about yourself how's the day been over there work that lunch break action let's go all right we're about to dive in on this nigerian silver right here oh i really do like the nose on this one i like the consistency too do a nice chunk here so we can get a good flavor test make sure we get a good low temp one on this one i want to get the flavor here cheers but it's still this one's my favorite one so far it's not terps that like smack you in the face like some of the dabs that i have um but it's a really nice um smooth still does burn your nose all these have that nose burning quality to them and they just kind of get you in the nostrils i don't know what it is okay all right really nice smooth taste on that one as well like smooth through the throat um [ __ ] little floral action way sweeter than the other two although the other one was kind of like i had just that crc taste to it in the second one it was like almost flavorless very mellow where this one does come through a little bit more with the flavor you get that sweetness to it i do enjoy that one um you said i haven't had coroba in years love their edibles the 1000 milligrams put me on my ass every time every time how much would you take of it toes because i took like a dropper or so i think about what strains have i reviewed okay so this one we just did was the nigerian silver and then right before that i took a dab of the caramel cream and then right before that i took a dab of the kamala kush and then i'm also gonna try this j1 right here next and then they give me some flour too some triple o g flour right here which i'll have to smoke um sometime might as well give it a testaroni bologna you know looks pretty solid i gave it a smell it has a nice like cheesy og smell to it um very funky very funky to it like almost a gassy cheese oh gee to it which i'm about and then i got a [ __ ] 50 milligram uh peanut butter dip cookie here mini cookie and then we've got three uh pre-rolls as well one of them was a pre-roll blunt which is super dope i'm actually really excited to smoke that um but it's not just any blunt it's a hemperil blunt because i don't even smoke blunts so i was hyped to see that they had a hemperil blunt i was like yeah that's nice so very very excited oh wait actually one all flowered blunt very excited oh yeah hell yeah very very excited toast yeah by the looks of it i'm pretty damn sure that's a hemp wrap i'm like 99 sure never seen a blunt wrap look like that so i'm excited about that hemp blondes are where it's at i wouldn't even smoke a regular blunt i don't like tobacco a little bit more q-tip action and then we can try the last dab very excited for this last one as well here i'm pretty sure this one was a different processor if i peeked correctly i just took a quick quick little gander at it okay this one is processed by sakida northwest i have never heard of this company and this is some j1 right here i've never heard of this company okay just by the looks of it i can tell you this is crc um let's see our c how the terps are we have 65 milligrams of thc which is a little bit on the low side the other ones are 653 milligrams of thc the other ones are around 750 so maybe this one has higher terpene ratio but we'll see okay it's like a wet a slightly wet sugar consistency let's see how the smell is like yep i expected so it's a mellow crc smell it doesn't have a j-1 terp to it very much oh actually no it totally does hold on sorry sorry hold on hold on there it is i'm wrong sorry sometimes crc jack herrera is a very tough one sometimes to discern between the terps of jack and the crc this one does have a crc backbone to it but you can smell the jack there you can totally smell it oh yes i love love love love um jack herrera i'm super super excited for this one i think i'm gonna like this one a lot am i gonna play some more tarakov um later yeah i'll play some more tarkovs later definitely definitely okay oh wow yeah i'm most excited about this one out of all of them so far i can say that for sure i mean i just tried the other ones too yeah there we go a little mix-a-roni bologna too look at that yeah you can tell it's crc right off the bat um and the the smell to it at the start i did get the nose of crc but then as i smelled it more and more you it totally has a very strong jack backbone and uh j1 is very says that jack smell oh yeah i'm about that oh i'm so about that i'm gonna grab some water right now i know i'm about to be sweating after this dab you know yes oh [ __ ] these don't have okay okay corova okay i do have one thing that i just noticed that i may have noticed before but i'm just noticing again this packaging the square box is re this is removable from the gram most people just keep the gram and throw out the box unfortunately on these grams there's no identification as to which strain this is they're on this box so if i have four different strains and i throw out all the boxes and i keep just the grams i'm now left with four grams that i have to every single time i have to peep the bottoms of them to see which one is which and i have to try and remember which one is which and if i have 20 different strains that becomes very hard so now i need to keep their boxes so that's a note that's a note i'm going to note that for them i'm going to note that oh [ __ ] i should have been writing stuff down about each one but it's okay i'll post that i'll post this video i can send them the video of the terp review and um um am i oh i'm i'm toasted i'm toasted uh i've taken now three dabs um of their stuff and i kind of took a slight um tolerance break yesterday where i didn't smoke as much as i normally do and so it's been really nice today i've been just getting [ __ ] high as [ __ ] seriously hi which is really nice so yeah um ooh yeah okay i gotta say i do think that i might be feeling i mean uh since i've taken three dabs in a row it's really hard to say which one necessarily i'm feeling the most but it feels like that last one that nigerian silver really does slap and i do like the smell on that one the best so far except for this j1 i have high hopes for this j1 and smelling it oh yeah um green i am reviewing the j1 here which is processed by was it sakita north west um and sold through corova and then the nigerian silver processed by beehive extracts the caramel cream processed by bobsled in the kamala kush processed by beehive i've tried the kamala the nigerian silver and the caramel cream so far um i thought the kamala was pretty solid for some non-crc it had a um was almost like a cheesy smell to it it had a good all of them so far have had like a nose burn where i really i felt the terps in my nose but none of them were harsh through the throat whatsoever all very smooth um i think that this one yeah yeah yeah it has more of like a cheesy cushy smell to it um where the other one processed by beehive the nigerian silver has a more sweet smell to it and oh yeah this one nigerian silver i think this one was my favorite out of the three i've tried so far super super tasty really smooth not like crazy crazy terpy like not like the chips just like smack you in the face and you're like oh yeah i'm sweating from those terps god damn i can taste them so much but still just like really nice overall um i really enjoyed that and then this one the caramel cream for um bobsled i'm not gonna lie bobsled um recently um some other stuff is pretty solid some of their stuff is so-so i think that they might be overly cr seeing a tiny bit of their stuff and um this stuff was solid but i'm gonna have to take another dab of it because it did kind of taste like it was just a little bit overly crc'd and i think that some people just don't need to crc product so much and i think that takes a little bit too much of the flavor away from it and makes it so you're kind of like grass you're reaching to try and find the notes of flavor that are left in the product you know what i'm saying so this one's solid all the highs from all of them are great they're all smooth so um pretty solid this last one though the j1 yeah processed by sakita northwest right off the bat i was like i can tell this is crc based on the look of it and then whenever i opened it i could tell the crc knows right off the bat but then as i smelled it more and more you really do get the jack herrer so this one the other one crc is color remediation column um so basically what companies do is they run a type of bleaching clay generally like a t3 t4 bleaching clay through a really big column and they'll run their product through that as well as an extra form of filtration and it i personally believe that most stuff that crc does overly crc then it takes out too much of the terps and flavor but if you use a disc to crc instead of a column then you can pull product that doesn't taste quite as overly crc and so yeah it all depends on the product certain strains go through crc columns very well and can be crc'd heavily and still taste really well afterwards certain um you know like this j1 is definitely a strain that does better through heavy crc as i can definitely tell here because i feel like the caramel cream isn't supposed to be like a a light like [ __ ] lemony smell to it you know what i'm saying that's the crc coming through where j1 does have almost a lemony terp so it kind of meshes well with the crc but you really do get the jack terp on this one as well as you smell it more you will get that full profile of the jack the j1 behind there i'm excited to try this one let's take a dab let's get it the last one of the terp review let's do it [Music] yeah a hundred percent green yeah a lot of companies are using a lot of filtration in the dabs that they're making i am excited to try this one is this one that has less thc a little bit less thc but i'm still very excited for this one i got rich really fast thc doesn't matter you know it's over all turks yeah trey let's get it [Music] we'll take a nice chunky dab here this is probably the last dab for me for a minute and we'll get a very good flavor tester big cheers everyone i'm really proud i hit it a little bit too high i'm just gonna drop a whole nother dab in there it just makes it not taste as good you don't get as much of a flavor i'd say that the crc does slightly mask the flavor of the j1 but you still get the jack chirps through there this is the only one out of the four that doesn't give me turn burn in my nose all the other ones burned my nose a little bit as i was exhaling this one is completely smooth entirely through do i have a stream schedule um yeah on monday wednesday and friday i go live at 10 30 a.m pacific standard time and i kind of just stream like till whenever and then normally i take a little break and then come back for a late night stream around like 10 or 11 or you know maybe nine um it's all pacific standard time by the way and then tuesday thursday sometimes i go live at 10 30 and sometimes i go live later in the day like anywhere between two and six p.m depending on if zenna has work and so is my fiance and depending on if she has work on tuesday and thursday i go live kind of differently but i let everybody know in the discord which i'll link right now in the chat um and then on the weekends um it always varies but i do most of the time stream every day i think i've streamed every day for the past like 400 plus days or so and so i try to keep on it keep up on it we had 420 subs last month so we're trying to get back up there and shoot for a thousand subs by 4 20 this month this year is the goal would be a dream for sure so yeah see if we can make it there but yeah i think that over the past like three or four actually realistically over the past couple years i've been putting in nearly 300 hours a month a lot of the time streaming and it's really starting to pay off these past few months especially hey much love kika how's it going over there hope your day's been nicely lit we've been chilling over here just finished up a little turk review and we've got up to nine dives actually i gotta change this dab counter actually speaking of the terp review that we just finished up let me formally wrap this up here for the youtube video thank you everyone on the youtube for watching this and thank you everyone that's been here live um i'm not leaving my live feed right now but i'm just going to wrap this up so i can cut it for my youtube this has been a little objective kurova review on four strains of corova that i haven't tried before three different processors which was really cool to get to try some different processors i'm going to give you all quick ranking this j1 was my favorite right here by sakita northwest i still think that they are we're overly crc in the product slightly i think that the flavor of the j1 was slightly masked by the crc flavor but this one was just so smooth like i got my forehead kind of sweating too like i see him kind of sweating a little bit from that double dab it was a really really nice dab overall and it has the smell of j1 it's really smooth definitely i really like this one very solid the nigerian silver is definitely my number two this one's by beehive extracts not cr seed which actually i really did like it's very very solid very like kind of a more floral flavor to it and i really like the high from this one it [ __ ] smacked me really really like this one my number three is gonna have to be the kamala kush another one processed by beehive not cr seed it has a really really nice almost like a cheesy cushy taste to it which i was about these ones both burned through my nostrils but my throat was great which indicates to me it was probably a clean product but just getting a little bit of that burning my nose you know sometimes this caramel cream also burned and this one's by bobsled i still like this one um i think that i need to take some more dabs of this caramel cream to really get a good overall flavor to it because it just didn't feel like i got enough of the flavor of the caramel cream coming through from the first one it did taste a little bit overly crc'd so we're gonna have to try some more dabs of that in the future and really get the flavor on that one coming through i really do like all of these i think they're all solid for the price um you know as far as like i wouldn't be like no none of these are i wouldn't say that any of them were bad necessarily or anything like that but i gave you all my rankings and that j1 solid and i actually really do like that [ __ ] uh this one as well the um the nigerian silver just has such a unique taste to it i like that it's a kind of almost floral uh two is floral fruity i love those uh i love those terps but it's not like citrusy at all you know it's nice i'm high i might as [ __ ] you just took five dabs um which is good that's good you gotta do it you gotta do it's good little turp review thank you everyone much love and uh we'll see you next time youtube if y'all uh are tuning in on the youtube i'm live every day on my twitch we're just talking about the schedule oh yeah so y'all heard about that oh cool well peace out cool i'll cut it there um but now now it's us now we're chilling again um narcion no no more chirp review recording we're done recording for the youtube um but i will try and clip that out uh if i remember to i'll try to remember too i should yeah what's good bob how's it going what's good what's good we are lit as [ __ ] after that that's what i'm talking about yeah nice recording session there right is good um", "Z0Na_EHdCq8": "Yatta that you already know what it is welcome back to my channel was probably so today I'm just smoking this backward it did really I'm just answering one of my most asked questions as a STONER so of course they always ask me how many grams you smoking today how much you smoking today that's one of the most questions most wait what I'm sorry guys listen I'm high right now so listen that's one of the most questions that I get asked sorry I can't talk I don't know why but look so that's one of them and another one is oh how high is your tolerance you know what I'm saying but the main one that I always get is bud or oil basically they're asking me would you rather choose bud or would you rather choose some of this oil right here now I wanted to make a youtube video or we - video where our our post is whatever the case is I just wanted to make a video for y'all so for the people that want to ask me they can get my answer right here so I don't always have to answer you guys a hundred times you know saying but listen this is my answer bud or oil my explanation he all is this I love oil because of the way it smells you know I'm saying I could heat up a a rig real quick quartz cows or something boom take a nice dab with some rosin or some live resin you know I'm saying [ __ ] tastes good [ __ ] gives you a different high you get a body high from oil just like edibles edibles and oil gives you body high this bud it gives you a head change you know what I'm saying so like I was saying yeah I can take a nice dab with some oil flavor nice train all right or I can roll up a backward or join or soar swisher whatever load of bong up you know the same your choice is smoking however you do it I can do that I love the way we looks but all I love to look at it I love the smell of it bro sometimes I hate breaking it down because it looks so good the note is so beautiful you know sound I don't really like breaking it down but you got to smoke it you know saying so but this is my answer to y'all bro I'm gonna pick a bud people asked me if you had to choose between a pound it'd be like this if I had to choose between a pound of Bud between a pound of oil I'm gonna take the pound of Bud you're saying I'm saying or whatever the case is whatever is equivalent to the pound of whatever you know I'm saying oil wise I'm gonna pick bud and this is the reason why first of all I got bud you can make oil out of bud you see this bud right here this bud right here I could turn this bud into oil you see what I'm saying this oil is by the [ __ ] rosin right y'all see it so gelato all right you see the gelato I cannot turn this rasa in this oil into bud I cannot make a butt out of this there's no way you're not going to get plant material out of this you see what I'm saying so say I said I was sitting on some oil right I'm sitting on oil and I'm like bug you know I'm taking dabs all day all day I take dams and a month looking like this I'm on my head man I've been getting I'll be getting my body hollowed and getting our body an hour all day no I want a head Shane you feel me I want to smoke some bud but you don't have nobody to smoke you see what I'm saying because you chose oil now say you're like me and you choose bud but I got a pound of this bud right here bro a pound of it I smoked [ __ ] an ounce of it [ __ ] another ounce another [ __ ] else I smoked a pack whatever I smoke three joints of it I'll smoke blunts of it right next thing you know I'm like [ __ ] dude I want to take a nice dab real quick I don't want to smoke no blunts or no joints I want to take it on ballroom I want to take a DAB what are you doing you just have bud you could turn your bud you can simply grab a hair strainer get it hot press the bud and turn that into oil you see I'm saying so then I can take a DAB Oh some oil with bud I can take a DAB with bud if you're saying you can't you can't smoke a blunt with oil you say I'm saying so my answer to bud or oil is gonna be bud all day because I could get oil from bud and you can't get bud from oil you out of the year you already know what it is teacher dabs in the build the out of a matter of fact I'm about the smoke dresses badly with y'all I know is it the question let you know hey if you have some more questions for me y'all want me to answer some more questions on here for y'all all you got to do is comment down below you

video if you couldn't tell from the title this wax tastes like [ __ ] watermelon and this is versa I've had this brand plenty of times on this channel already but watermelon I believe is one of their newest strains that was released at my local dispensary so I had to pick it up you know I've gotten the lemon oh geez the rainbow flames all that stuff like multiple times so as you can see I already opened it and you know that's how I know it tastes like watermelon but funny thing about that I actually bought it last night but the lighting in my room wasn't good so I was forced to just smoke it and doing a video in the morning the next day so I hope you guys can understand you still won't get to see all of it it's all all its glory and I will be using that utility in fine I know it's [ __ ] [ __ ] but I mean we're gonna have to make it work but juicy right here 73 percent THC not bad hopefully you guys can see it it's at the right and watermelon no Singlish is opening packaging very very nice another thing I'd like to mention is that this is different from the other eras that I've seen or have tried in terms of the consistency of blacks I mean look at it it's basically a sugar which is good because sugar it's harder to get on your lid you know you see it it's not gonna just if I did this it's not gonna slide down slowly like sauce would you know was very good smells really good I mean if I had to describe it as smell just like some raw garden stuff but it tastes different than how it smells which is crazy yeah like if there is actually a hint of like a watermelon or it might just be like a like a placebo you know that you know it's called watermelon that you kind of taste watermelon I'm not too sure but if you guys have tried this please let me know just give you a little soom in Gnome see the color is really good it's not too dark there's something about you know dark wax is just very unappealing but that doesn't mean that it can't be good Billy because I believe was

that came off we're gonna talk to you a little bit about the harvesting a little bit about the sherbert I'm gonna get faded we're gonna also then move on into the tent and kind of show you as harvesting it a little you can see the purple in the leaves and a super frosty hard to focus we think run for a while harvesting is not as exciting as it used to be but it is definitely a necessity we grow because it's hard to get the quality of nugs that we want so it's not like we're ever gonna stop but it definitely is not as fun as it used to be when you first started harvesting your first cup of grass really time-consuming you know we got it we got we separate it we separate trem from just families and then we got a you know hang it and dry it and get it Road trimmed up hung up and [ __ ] like that real sticky real stinky really clogs up our nose yeah we'll go to the tent what kind of show you guys cutting it down we already cut down some brush pros and a lot of the large the lower smaller nose yeah the stuff that just really you can do a lot with those types of knives we're gonna probably wash it down the road yeah those spices you can freeze it and just kind of forget about it for a while as long as the freezer doesn't go out you're fine yeah you don't also when you do a fresh frozen or any kind of like where you're gonna freeze it right away you want to make sure why you're chopping it down you don't waste a lot of time get it into the bag get it frozen as quick as possible the longer it takes from you cutting it down to getting it put in the bag of frozen really can affect your phone all come of your turks we even set a timer like ten minutes from the time we start cutting it to the time we bag it and freeze it who this seems to be hate you harder when you need a bit of lower tone a lot of people's gonna probably ask um we obviously don't go wet trim we just take off all the big families that have no no that might have some dry come but not a lot we'll put those usually in a separate trim bag but then in general we leave a lot of the clothes trim with the frosting this long yeah yeah yeah you talk about her drying and carrying dresses yeah like you said fresh frozen we kind of we set a 10-minute timer and we just don't make sure you don't get huge bags left just a bit bag big enough to fill up in that five minute period or a ten minute period drying drying we just take off the anything it doesn't have resin on it will even trip the tips of some leaves that have resin on it but really close to the now gamete buried into the dog is a little bit so we'll just trim the leaves off of that that's awful sorry hang it for about two weeks at least minimum at around 65 to 70 degrees doesn't ever go over that and it stays dark the whole time you want to make sure the air is being circulated and whatever room its drying in but you don't want any direct contact with like the wind and the nug so you don't want to drown too quick yeah yeah three weeks is ideal if you want to be doing dry Civ so you can go that route but yeah three weeks is it'll start to break off when the buds are snapping on us just when you think it's dry enough it's usually about three four more days after that then you take it down trim it you are it and it's pretty much ready to smoke and every week after that or to get a little smoother a little better cure wait a long time on this that was a minute now distillate flavors [Music] well yeah he gets really redundant it's really boring that's why we have to do it freely at night when I'm trying to go to bed at a certain point so this doesn't help it helps in the fact that after you know next month and everything you're not gonna be stressing about weed yeah that's always a bliss um you think it are growing heavy 16 is great we've been using it for a while Coco go back on some of our older videos botanic air a couple of data care products advance nutrients all we use is usually might use the big button overdrive yeah we're gonna probably to get ready we'll cut off and give you guys a little tour of us starting to do some of this trimming of the harvesting of the plant you guys they done all right we're back here rid of the harvesting the sugar ten all right okay can we cut this down guys we want to make sure we're leaving it we're gonna get rid of any kind some strings are really heavy trim screams we're gonna actually get a separate trim container these don't run a lot so we're gonna actually maybe trim up the tips and summer frosty completely so he get some time like that now again like we send that video earlier minimum ten ten to ten days two weeks could take you as long as you have not revealed fifty-five or sixty these days again you can get airflow don't get right here we're getting good weight again we took this about five things now Caitlin says we know so you also want to chop every they all want to be relatively the that way you know that you want some drying faster than other to take a longer period even everything yeah we got stuff that might have been your stems and others I want to not have driving process is already at the table while [Music] unwanted time humans before you harvest stop watering trying to dry out your room that was enough if you shut it down right after you water it they're not going to show you the entire harvest we could take us probably an hour for anyone experience rewarding your first year harvest we'll do one hangar I said beautiful bugs get on our IQ higher standard CA and make four to Lussier could barely see some close up any other purpose so we're really learning to the enmity starts his fate here or I didn't really that's kind of what you're looking two more of these or problems or over rather compromising the plants No a lot of soil growers really flush everything out they have a nice beat watch the plant starts to cannibalize drop really shark in the winter yeah some people like to do that this is not we found them less stress the plant goes theory flushing as well man come we've learned that you've actually got better aromas he's been thinking and we also got completely why not stuff that was falling off yes make people leave anywhere that might ask now we're pretty solid on the back down the white ass just means that Moisture is moisture content or moisture that's you know as growers you start to hit buttons c-bro flush women that drives with the weird foliar spray which I'm not lazy but I guess that you know I'm sure there's examples of why right now but in general just business way got sprayed on it went up assume that there's gonna for everything maybe put support save the Ox the hanger will look grill what was that calculation begin those the og some shirts see how they're all now what will happen is a lot of these extra families kind of Cocoon on the blood start the curing process we kind of rocket all right guys you can check out our chief apartment Victoire 20cm we're going keep out", "a6BMDjoAf_0": "[Music] Peggy's going on YouTube it's your boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "OYzizoPgQZo": "[Music] [Music] try and make this right if you try to make this right what's a guy's simplistic hair fact with another well I'm just if you want you should always put someone biting your thing I dunno what's up guys simplistic so guys simplistic here back with another video if you can see or you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be a diamonds bear labs review but we got RJ eats you know I'm saying shout out to the homie and also tattoos by kaze if you guys haven't checked out the merch I'll also post got in the bond description below that is my homie right there and he does tattoos so if you're interested in the Modesto 209 area show you boys and love you know I'm saying I show you the back and I mean yeah yeah so yeah which is surprising that cos he actually went up to me and was like someone actually messaged him through Instagram through my videos and was like can I get one of these so that's pretty cool another thing I like to mention I'm not gonna probably mention it and then in like the next coming videos probably do a few more times but my merch is going to have a coupon code because it is my birthday month and if you enter March for all caps you get seven dollars off your merchandise so should be a good little discount for you guys but like I said I'm gonna mention it in probably like a few more videos because kind of getting annoying and now I've already did it like twice and I feel like it's a little bit repetitive but you know I'm saying if you want some gear get some gear if you don't okay no I'm sayin so we got some bear labs and just as like the other video I'm gonna have him open it and then imma film it with my camera that way I don't have to take off this you know right here is sherbert so right off the bat you could notice that that ninety seven percent total cannabinoids but just for those of you who think that that's THC it's not tht is actually on the top left right there no off 20 on the bone right there so it's actually 85 percent THC at low temperatures so right off the bat like from looks when she showed me it no diamonds don't mean like that means she's a little small so open [Music] this smell is actually like so I'm okay so with diamonds usually there is like barely any taste I've noticed because it's like I guess it's like THC a diamond I don't know what it's not really good though there lies always smells good and they see you know yes - Wow we're gonna reserve our judgment till we actually tried the damn thing you know anything but rather bat I'm gonna be using the utility and you know I'm saying we got the bubbler from brain fog er brain we do it gentlemen this start it already let's start reporting oh yeah is it it's gonna be for this actually no it's because there's no stabilization on there you definitely notice it instead of like on the camera [Music] yes so if you haven't already try to look for some extra videos it's kinda like extra videos from my channel you know but it's a his perspective you know like if you if I don't upload on that day maybe check out some more videos baby no no my boy I'll post every dance and I don't know he's five days woman if I did yeah I stream on Tuesday and then Friday at a deal Cheers we're gonna pecs on my wife's hands it we got judge this wax first goes in give it a shot up you gotta start cleaner that's probably my taste Wow yeah not bad bro just like a better version of the candidate no it tastes like it tastes like what choppa Canada tastes like when it's good well we try it yeah was anything mean was that less trouble Kenan could use no I just said it server honey no I said it please like like it should have been it [ __ ] truck in bucket truck I subscribe why we're picking that up again a Linda I receive it some rubble looking right away and about address agent the truck panic look into other direction we didn't see that [Music] it's not bad honestly for diamonds I thought it'd be less curvier we're like no taste at least but I wanted to do this video for you guys bear labs dine in sherbert diamonds number one we call it it's actually pretty smooth to so but in car it was good better than trouble Kenny Kenny's that keep picking up in bear laps maybe you know continue I always show love regarding this one in blue $27 over there 29 row garden that's do so yeah no I checked this is 29 oh that's why been buying raw garden guys I'm trying to try some new stuff and uh with new stuff I could do videos you know nice room no I'm pretty sure you guys are sick of raw garden wax videos cartridge videos I'm not sure if you guys are sick of it just because they're cartridges but we're gonna take one more parts we're gonna get into cartoon and it's so convenient how you can just have it anymore any time adjusting it and good good size not bad but for $29 I probably wouldn't just spent $2 less in garden for maybe four dollars less and Bob got easing in because like I said I only bought this because this is a new thing I've been buying buddies lately wall garden all other stuff and to switch it back to their labs you know every now and then and it's not that it's not not the best you know the best of their labs I think was for me in greeters that all the one that I did a video on I'm not sure what it was yeah no mine was like banana or something banana really no it might have been something cookies I don't know what it was but I'll check it out but yeah there you go shine sherbert timings check out our J eats merch if you want to check that out and I gotta talk about this with precious everybody wants me to [Music] pick a song cut every 5th grade [Music]", "WgJN23rfcvE": "[Music] you hey what's up guys simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another wax review and I'm gonna be honest with you I actually tried to do this yesterday by his left the lens zoom din so you basically just see like no none of my eyes just my nose down and I don't know it was a good video - off speaking on some [ __ ] [ __ ] since topics and stuff but before I start this video it is December 8th and I'd like to say rest in peace the juice world I wasn't the biggest fan of him by like some of his music and 21 is still very young to go especially with like seizures and [ __ ] so yeah man rest in peace other than that we're gonna start this review video if you couldn't tell from the title it is peanut butter breath and it is from Ursa and I like to mention that the only reason I picked this up is because I have a friend Stevie who's very much into this strange so I've basically got it to make him jealous and to also let him know that there is the selection there that if he chooses to go and get it if he knows I believe there was $24.00 out the door for a gram and it's running at about 74 percent THC I also like to mention that RJ is also his voice is coming through the TV so you might hear like an echo of me or him and also we're gonna be blogging today in SF so it should be a good one and RJ's gonna be vlogging it with this new camera so it's gonna be dope other than that let's start with this video Oh before we start and you just get some tea no I'm going yeah opening this show you what it looks like yeah very very good stuff and you know I've already tried this next scenario in the video but once you open this you can smell it like some waxes you can't really like once you open it doesn't smell like it's like a like a jar of wheat what's your opening you smell it's crazy [Music] let's say anything to the peoples RJ not today we're not uploading it today it's happening today we're filming it today well doesn't mean I'm uploading it today what the hell that mean I have to come home early start editing once I get home which I'm not trying to do right here good stuff and I will be hitting it out of the utili 5 I know some of you expressed some distaste for me always using the utility you got to realize this is the only thing I could hit it out and if I am not using what you like then just click off the video because like there's other we tubers that smoke out of rigs and bonds and stuff you know and if I don't have that kind of content for you don't click it and if it upsets you don't watch you know people seem to get upset when they watch my videos but there's an option to always not watch you know a Smith like I don't know it's up to you and for the most of you guys you don't really care what I'm smoking up you just care about the video in general and what what's being said in it you know I'm saying and you know if I don't have those type of videos for you I mean there's plenty of other we tubers you know when you hit hockey no just mean yourself so he's gonna play a song and mute himself I'm still gonna be continuing on on this review the tastes very similar to that of the og types of raw garden I'm very very much loving the consistency of the wax very proportionate amount of diamonds to sauce which makes it all the more pleasant you know sometimes raw guards and be having like a fat diamond in there and just like some sauce but this is more like evenly proportioned you can tell right here you got some toss toss you got some sauce mixed in with some of that diamonds you just call it boss now huh da sauce but yeah hopefully it's been a alright video so far and uh you know I I'd hate to start it on it on it down no you know like juice world passing away but uh man that sucks rest in peace man let me take it out hit another get fully charged pen for today so and I got two batteries for my camera now so like I have more but like I'm only gonna bring two that's enough so we're definitely gonna have a lot of footage for you guys and honestly the most exciting part is probably using Randy's new camera I want to see what it looks like you know I'm glad I want to say that for those of you who are interested in what camera he is actually using it as a cam it Canon m50 and it was cost a pretty penny I'll tell you that Cheers mother and that the taste is there very very good I would recommend it very very very similar price to that wall garden so if you're tired of raw garden and you want to try another brand check out Ursa definitely another good substitute if raw garden isn't there or any other brands of wax that you haven't sure that you like it but it isn't there try it it's not bad other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] you", "N0exp56rtNg": "welcome to the shed this is iced out images coming at you with another product review this one is once again I haven't got the kid to respond to me yet about the discipline came from them so just like my last product review that I did yesterday I'm going to put that in the description below so this is Tropicana cookies is the name that I was told on the top the person just wrote traffic honor and I know I pronounced that weird but I'm from England so that's just the way it comes out of my mouth smells so [ __ ] good live better so pick this up 45 of G so I got this and then I got the mother's milk which is in the other video if you don't mind going to watch that one if you enjoy these videos just [ __ ] cold out today house how blonde leaves whoa [ __ ] freezing so I'm still in my work gear but so 45 of G got the mother's milk and got this mother's milk previous video blah blah blah blah blah so this one I don't have my other phone with me much kids on it right now but the the stuff that I can remember that I looked up is that it is peppery citrus hoppy flavor it is cross between Girl Scout cookie and tan G so I've had to Angie before and I've had Girl Scout cookie I've liked both so we're just gonna jump right into this we're gonna be rocking it off of my sci-fi glass piece so anyone new to this channel sci-fi glass shout out to these guys I like a lot of their [ __ ] so far like off-the-wall and cool-looking start heating up the Bangor and get this damn and after work did that I busted my ass in the freezing weather kind of dead you know well hopefully everyone else had a fantastic and warm day I froze my dick off pretty much any time they took my hand and my gloves off and my hands were exposed to the air from the moment I pumped up a tire this morning time I got to work time I got home just cold it's going to be like 17 degrees tonight here in Michigan maybe even less I forget it might be 10 degrees I don't remember get my days mixed up a little bit yeah what's that hopefully you guys had a great day sad I just worked came home my girls about to leave for work so I'm gonna take this and then go inside and spend the rest of set time with my son I'm supposed to pick up my mother car today it didn't start been sitting for months so we're certain it's gonna be the battery we tried to jump it that didn't work we changed the battery out that ended up not working come to find out that on Lexuses there's like if you do something a certain way the security system won't let the car start or recognize that the key fobs inside the car I don't know it's pushed the start though this shit's all new to me it'll be the newest car is over owned 2010 which happens to be almost 10 years old the last war I had was a 92 Toyota for sale before that was a 99 stable 99 contour prior to that the newest car I owned was a 2002 or what if there was a 2002 that I got in O five it was a Saturn SC 2 coupe and I loved it that car so from my other video I'm gonna let this cool down just a little bit longer than I did last night because that [ __ ] must have still been too hot because it's just instant and I was baked but you know I didn't I didn't taste as much of the chirps and stuff as I wanted especially coming from something like this quality ooh Oh fat daddy tasty damn there's that peppery / hoppy taste the citrusy part is almost like bitter you know like it hits hard yeah very tasty well as I said I'll find out what this bow these are from and I'll put it in the description below in case anyone wants to try to get their hands on it I understand it was 45 a gram from the kid I get it from I'm not sure what deals they're running for you know it says five g's on it so so I know the guy picked up 10 grams of live batter five in this one five in the other I got a gram of each very very tasty strong strong high and pretty sure this is a hybrid I don't know I'll put it in the description below I'll copy the ship from Leafly and just I will put it right in there and any other information that I need to put in so yeah strongly recommend it Tropicana cookies if you can get your hands on it it's probably pretty good in just normal wax but if you can afford to spend the extra money and get the you know the live batter I'd recommend it the quality is better taste is better and the potency definitely seems higher just seems like a better product all the way around compared to say a lot of these you know FPR ones that I've been getting from healing tree Wellness Center that's not talking [ __ ] about healing tree Wellness Center that's just saying that the quality of this is better than that and the proofs didn't pudding you know that's like a dark almost goldish color almost like a like an amber type color almost and this [ __ ] like crystal white almost not quite egg yellow but man that smell I wish you guys could smell this [ __ ] you guys wouldn't be like a throw me add a beam right now and uh you know for some of you some of you live close enough to where we could arrange [ __ ] like that you know stop in at the shed and come being a video just chitchat [ __ ] [ __ ] take a DAB and we can you know have like guest spots like hey that is specifically towards you Jim Becker obviously and anybody else we can figure some [ __ ] out like a little meet-and-greet kind of thing little smoke sesh but chances are I'm gonna do it on camera so that it's me interacting with subscribers and in you guys high office and [ __ ] that uh you might not usually buy but other than that you guys are all awesome not just one of my subs a lot more people at commenting from here on out and yeah I appreciate you guys thanks for watching sub like comment enjoy the rest of your day and as I said I will put everything in the description below and comment let's chitchat let's talk Tropicana delicious peace out guys", "hrwB4DVkjZk": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title this is going to be another bear labs review and you guys know my love for bear labs I already made like two or three videos on it basically exclaiming to the whole [ __ ] YouTube world then I love bear labs and it was fairly priced and it was like for the quality that you for the price that you gain the quality it is it's something that I had to make a video on like I just had to show you and I ended up getting two more strings so we're probably just gonna open one today just because I want to I want to pace myself or I want to basically in moderation if this one's open already it's more of a I'm more inclined to to smoke it you know so if I just have one of them open I'll finish that one first before I finish the other one I don't want to have to and then I just be picking up both of them at the same time hope you guys can understand but you ready no bear labs this is both technical extracts and research labs you guys know I love the purple punch didn't have it this time but they did have Sunday driver and I looked at it and it looks fairly similar to that of the purple punch the white waxy texture and as you can see let's just see the percentage of THC one is 79 one is 83 so they're definitely high up there in potency once cookie and cream one is Sunday driver and I can show you the price right here I paid $20 for one I had to buy it twice I was buying one and then I was like can I pull out money at the ATM to buy another one and they're like yes so I bought two each for the price of 20 it says 20 31 but they rounded to the basically rounded no changed up in there yeah it's just gonna [ __ ] so I'm actually outside Randy's house and I actually don't have his file for him which is um basically the only reason I came here oh and to like smoke with him I guess but [ __ ] I just realize that now you know sometimes you like over plan and then you just end up not having all the stuff that you need you know happens quite a lot but you trying some of this like if I didn't have the spirit card right now I wouldn't be making this video thankfully I leave of spare SD card unless [ __ ] no they're God's God's do let me know in the comments if you've tried bear lads very very good stuff I'm gonna try their Sunday drivers there's no one I'm gonna open she could see right here very white looking I like I don't know just something about wax the lighter it is the better it looks you know it turns of wax that's what I usually [Music] not gonna lie guys that smells pretty phenomenal I'm just checking it got a good shot of it means very very nice it's not actually the same consistency of the purple punch but the same color nonetheless honestly it smells pretty good I'm pretty excited to try it so I'll let you know how how it tastes and everything right off the bat very easy to commit mess with very easy not as easy as the wax from their other stuff in the bubble punch still nonetheless [Music] [Music] cheers yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] very smooth very tasty actually but not as dirty as the purple punch but the flavor is there very enjoyable very smooth very light it's very light hit for how much that came out I usually would caught I mean just I kind of want to pack another one I'm not gonna lie because it is very light but it is running at a high percent of THC so well that was much easier to just drop in like that so take another one for you guys but yeah man check out bear labs for the price they're able to put their [ __ ] out for like the quality is definitely worth more than what they what they think they're worth so Cheers yeah definitely very tasty nice terpene like I said of the purple punch but nonetheless still still enjoyable experience I'm actually feeling pretty high right now I'm getting there and then Sunday driver is usually a good strain so yeah one more hit just clearing this one gotta clear the remaining Vinnie cheers guys last hit oh yeah I'm super high so yeah bear labs there you have it guys hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just a quick little review of bear labs one of my new favorite concentrate brands yeah nothing but good things to say about this brand but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "_cBnbmY67EU": "[Music] alright you might have seen the intro already but I wanted to open this because I'm actually outside Blake's house and the lighting in his room isn't the best and he's always playing music so I figure I just opened this right now and the only reason I want to do this right now is begin not at home is because I actually want them to try it as well you know I want to share with them I want them to know what they think of it you know I'm saying so I wanted to do the opening right now and then I will do the review at home by myself later on so if you do see me like you know in a car and then a mouse that's what happened guys we're just gonna be looking at it okay so this was bought at phenols I believe it was $28 and it's white Tahoe cookies and it's live resin butter know what threw me off was filled is usually a lot more expensive but then when they said butter I was like oh you know I'm saying because when it comes to the type of concentrate that actually costs a lot of money because butter is part of like the easiest concentrate to make other than probably rosin you know rosin very simple but you do need expensive gear and stuff the butter is generally pretty easy you know I'm saying so that's why it was only like 25 dollars a gram I noticed that the THC percentage is pretty low but like I said it doesn't really matter about just THC you know there's other things involved and it's live resin so it should be some terpenes up in there to kick it up a notch so let's just open this I don't want to just kind of keep the box nice and Christine for the what I'd a bit or a later I might just rip it cuz [ __ ] it gets a box right care about a box but yeah why Tahoe cookies has been I've talked about it on this channel before oh wow very very nice I've tried some of the fields stuff before as well I have never tried their cartridge though what the hell what off the bat I really like the packaging this is very very easy sheet look at this [ __ ] you could [ __ ] have this on like a shoe design you know and be dope that's pretty [ __ ] dope dice oh wow it looks like wow I'm actually pretty surprised I wasn't expecting this I haven't empty said butter I thought it'd be like a crumble ish but it's like a light color which I really enjoy okay 20 I'm gonna say $28 maybe 27 I don't know around there but Wow okay excu a look at it first let me get the thumbnail get the thumbnails always yeah alright guys back at my house I am going to continue the review of this field extract white Tahoe cookies no I'm saying if I already opened the box and all that before I went to play Xcel's but now that we're at home we're gonna finish this review off drop the bat low very very nice packaging I did not keep the dab tool that it came with I gave it to Blake but this slip is pretty good like yeah they were actually impressed like I gave money a hit and then he was like I'm about to go there right now even though he just went to the club like two hours we'll hope that honestly says a lot filled extracts usually is a pretty expensive to you know very very creamy creamy looking we're just gonna take a hit since they're gaming right now I'm probably just gonna mute them for now I'm saying but that was RJ and Ben on the game you know saying so we're gonna take a hit of this and then we're just gonna tell you a little bit more about the product itself I'm saying not bad I'm like oh I feel the extracts usually they have that sauce that kind of looks like a sugar wax sugar sauce see wax you know I'm saying you know boys [Music] [Music] very very clean taste very smooth - for a hit that I just took like that size I usually would be coughing but very very pleasant not to like chirpy but you can definitely taste like a slight hint of like like some cookies you know some very earthy pungent I don't know how else to describe it but it's a very familiar taste and not bad like first price and I've always wanted to do like a field extracts video or another one after that because I kind of did like it it was just too pricey but yes another thing I like to mention is I mentioned this on most of my videos but the price that I get it it's not the price that you're gonna get out depending on where you are so please be aware of that I don't want to steer you in the wrong way you know just because I get it for 29 doesn't that mean you'll get it for you know what hopefully you do get it for 29 and yeah other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just another product video hope you guys can understand this is pretty good stuff I'm not gonna lie other than that have a great day [Music]", "KH011aczvvY": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'll change back again for another concentrate review today actually riding solo this time but I just thought I'd come through take couple dabs of the gas see what's good with this raw garden and farm cookies I don't think I need to talk too much about cookies warm cookies obviously as many you guys know is the form cut from way back in the icy mag days but you know obviously we've been smoking cookies for quite a long time done a ton reviews on this one on delve too much into that side of it raw garden is somebody that you know you've been seeing a lot on the scene in California the last year too especially for the live resin especially below and are not necessarily low in but the budget stuff I know we do a lot of crazy concentrate reviews sometimes you guys are asking us to you know go find the hypest [ __ ] that we can find and review it whatever the you know crazy new [ __ ] is sometimes you know some people just want to see good deals stuff that's affordable you know I mean so we're trying to review stuff that kind of hits you know all levels of the spectrum this stuff right here as we go open it up good color right away I mean as as is typical with the most live residents usually gonna be a pretty light color it's not always you know what I'm gonna go on as far as you know appearance with with some wide but going in on the nose here it's actually sweeter than I was expecting it's it's kind of really sweet not as much of the cookie thing in there it's not you know doughy it's not doesn't have that that cookie funk that you know we've all become accustomed to but it's definitely a little bit sweeter than I'm used to for form compete yeah that's interesting I'm excited to see what it dabs like so this stuff is you know a single source whole plant run I'm pretty sure it's clean green certified and obviously whatever that means these days you know a pretty basic packaging just comes on a little box with a childproof jar inside on the side says 100% raw cannabis keep refrigerated or frozen clean green certified your single source grown and extracted for you recommended use vaporize at low temps it also says the score the fridge which is uh good advice see this nails heating up here raw garden I want to say they've been around for a while I wanna say 2012 may be 2011 so they definitely been in a game for a minute I never really you know saw them you know really take off until they started doing this this live resin a year to go and like I say for the budget stuff for if you're looking for you know maybe not the most exotic maybe not the most flavorful but good bang for your buck as far as you know actually getting you high I feel like they're usually pretty good bet obviously the flavor on some of these can be hit and miss but in general you really can't go wrong on cookies I want to see what it tastes like [Music] okay there's a little cookie tube in there a little bit it's again a lot sweeter like I was thinking with going with the smell the taste is is sweet like I was expecting I definitely got a little bit more of that cookie kind of hint on the flavor than I did with the smell it's almost like a little earthy afterwards I don't know it definitely does leave you an interesting aftertaste on YouTube so I'll be right back I guess I'm going to need a checklist for these videos from now on I usually get all my [ __ ] together and double and triple-check but somehow I forget q-tips nine times out of ten the prior being a STONER I guess yes you know I'm off the first dab you know I'd say it's pretty good not really feeling a super immediate head change I think we need one more really capture the full effect but uh Jerry and Batman seem to be feeling it [Music] Aurum cookies are really any cookies in general is something that you know is always kind of a staple for me because it's generally something that you can smoke pretty much any time of the day morning noon or night obviously that's why it's been a staple a lot of people's you know smoke stash for quite a few years now I feel like it's just it's just a good working high you know I mean you can you smoke it you feel it but it doesn't make me want to lay on the couch necessarily it doesn't make you want to get up and run around the block necessarily either but you know I mean just burn everyday smoke you know being able to rotate through all the different cookie cuts that are out there is never a bad thing alright let's go down another one here I'm gonna take this one a little hotter just for fun I'm gonna do that Cheers [Music] that might be a bad idea that one was a little rough I feel like you got the job done I'm definitely feeling the head change now in general this raw garden stuff or any you know cheap budget oil which is what I would call this this stuff was let's see 35 bucks a gram so I mean depending on what state you're living in now prices are all over the place that could be a breezy expensive if you're living in a couple of sticks that could be super cheap if you're living in other states and I mean for out here for 35 bucks a gram I feel like with most things you just got to have a good eye about it I mean you got to pick and choose so all in all I'd say you know it's not the the best libraries and I've ever had I'd say this particular batch you know it's decent for paying 35 bucks a gram especially for out here you know obviously markets and these different legal states are all over the place right now so 35 bucks might be kind of steep or super cheap depending on where you're at but you know for 35 bucks out here I feel like bang for your buck it's a pretty good deal all right I'm lit up like a [ __ ] Christmas tree I need to get out of here thank you guys for joining me for another episode of the CCC I'm ashamed [Music]", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ] video on live browsing and don't forget to subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way and if you need

until tomorrow so go monday video i hope everyone's having a fabulous weekend and i just want to say thank you guys for you know supporting this channel we're going to go ahead and review some true wax of some newer true wax from true leaf i'm going to do two indica strains we are going to talk about space age cake which i had never seen before but i was told by the bud tender they just get every now and again and then i got the sunset sherbert cush mints which i believe is part of the cultivar collection let's talk about this space age cake first i found the box there we go because he used to have the percentages on the packaging so i i got was or i've gotten used to chucking the boxes this space age cake was clocking in at 76.068 c0 cbd for a total of 76.68 and on the sherbert flash cushman this one was clocking in it's 73.090 thc 0cd for a total of 73 this is the cush mints oh it smells really good it smells uh i didn't have the flour so i cannot compare it but i don't know it has like a fruity wheaties smell fruity wheaty fruity fruity something like that let's do it i like the texture of it i have it in my room i mean it's not like it's hot in here all right let's do what i have cheers all right cheers [Laughter] wow oh wow there's a fan come on let's do it beyonce can you handle it oh got a new little rig what you know about little mushrooms they're cute okay so sunset sherbert and cushman's i'm pretty sure yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 10 out of 10 we'll be getting again fire i didn't get the flower but um if it was anything like the ray bay which was or the grape cake because i got both of them they were both fire i just haven't had this in flower but nice heavy indica in fact babe my back is killing me right and i just loosened up a little [ __ ] hair okay there's that okay i can well maybe it's just the way i'm sitting i don't know if it's the way i'm sitting or what i don't know but there's that no i definitely heavy indica love the effects of this stuff [ __ ] fire i i love it i don't even really need to take another dab right now but for science purposes and because i said we're doing a twofer we will do that of course i'm just gonna get super more high off of that but i have been smoking this so we could talk about it all right so let's talk about this space age cake this one's like a little bit more gassy and it seemed to be a little a little bit harder than that one like the texture it was a little bit more firm like the other one was a little bit uh i don't want to say it was gritty it wasn't gritty but it wasn't this is different this one's like shiny and now mind you i'm keeping all of these in my room in room temperature setting i do store it in this little stash box that i got but for the most part i keep it at room temperature i do want one of those cool little refrigerators that people get honey all i want for christmas is a fridge for my wax no there's that i really don't need this i swear to god that was a nice dab all right let's do this let's do the space age cake we're on it oh it's 3 30 [Music] cheers oh [Music] oh i'll show you guys this little hack real quick on how i've been cleaning my rigs i'm not gonna recommend doing this doing this at your own risk but check it i've got my hot rig now this is room temperature water i am filling a q-tip i know y'all use alcohol right but just watch it actually kind of like cleans up a lot of it too instead of using alcohol look at how much boom now if you have a shitty banger do this at your own risk boom there's my hack you're welcome all right so space age cake i'm glad i picked this little guy up i thought it was a new strain and i was like hey i've never seen this and the guy's like informed me that no i was wrong it was not new it's just something they don't have a lot of i've never seen it someone else let me know if they always saw space age cake i don't know what i i've been going to truly for three years now i swear i was like this is new i haven't seen it in wax anyone bueller either way 10 out of 10 will be getting that again both of these are awesome true indicas heavy hitting love them i ain't mad at these waxes at all i never really am i mean that's one thing about reviewing the canvas it's not like there's a lot of products so i'm like [ __ ] this [ __ ] i'm out oh let me say i have had the issues with the wax i was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] i'm out at sotera's wax i haven't even been back to sentara and uh purely crumble that will look like frozen but i still have it i never returned it i haven't been to daytona all right yeah i think we're done here so yeah both of these waxes absolute fire i hope i'll be able to post a video wednesday you guys might back like i said i heard it today and i really know i won't feel the effects of it until like tomorrow so wish me luck if you don't see it maybe i'll pop a little like help me video if it's that bad on wednesday just to get some sympathy views i don't know yeah i think we're good are we down here babe we are done here if you made it all the end of this video you're awesome please go ahead and drop a like be a big face and drop a dick's like yeah okay there's that", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "tt2jaAPM66I": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title we are going to be comparing live rosin and live resin first off let's get this out of the way live resin is made with bho which is a solvent and live rosin is made with no solvents then let's get that out of the way but the brands that we have in question here is raw garden and we got classics this being the live resin and this being the live rosin and i made a video on this one already but i did not make a video on this but i woke up today and i was just like i want to make a video so let's just see what i got and see what videos i can make so you know like i said i rarely get live rosin so when i do i try to make the most videos out of it as i can and once again shout out to p2ps for making this possible he gave me some funds to uh purchase some live rosin myself he didn't tell me to purchase live rosin but you know i figured you guys have been asking for me to get live rosin for quite some time now you know i don't get it all too much but when i do it's a it's a special occasion but once again shout out to p2 peeps he finally reached 1k on youtube here's hoping the 10k this year you know what i'm saying so like i said uh i did a video on this classics live rosin already but i didn't do a video on this but i would like to say that this strawberry rose from raw garden is super fire i will be giving you close-up shots and all that stuff but i would i wanted to make this video to explain the differences between live resin and live rosin because it's an only one letter difference and i feel like some people especially people get getting into cannabis or extracts and stuff don't really know what's up also take what i say with a grain of salt because i am not an expert in any way this is just me uh researching stuff from myself but live resin for those of you who don't know is basically the live and live resin means is when you harvest your plants and you flash freeze right when you harvest them instead of allowing the plant to cure over months and all that stuff and basically reduce the moisture in the plants but the initial moisture from when you just harvest the plants is the initial terpenes that you get from that live resin so right after harvesting you know how plants look super sticky when you just harvest them but then when you cure them they kind of like dry out and become less crystallized and all that stuff but when you just harvest them you flash freeze them you get all the live resin terpenes the initial terpenes that are there when you just harvest the plant usually extracted through a closed loop system using bho and all this other stuff but yeah that's generally how you make live resin live rosin on the other hand you would think you know you would just uh you know flash free some rosin or something and make it that way or maybe flash-free some plants and then just squish it but for those of you who don't know rosin is made by heat and pressure you know i've made some rosin on this channel before i use the the juice box which is a handheld rosin and basically you get a little you shape your little nug into like a hockey puck and then you squeeze the [ __ ] out of it with metal plates that are hot and in return you just get oil that squeezes out in between the metal plates and that's what you collect in terms of rosin but that is not live rosin that is flower rosin live rosin is a little bit more complicated that's probably why it costs so much more in terms you know 710 labs costing like 70 to 80 this might i add was like around 45 to 50 so still pretty pretty pricey uh but probably on the lower end of live rosins that you can get on the market uh but live rosin basically have to make ice hash which is you know you put your your your flour into like an ice bath and you shake out all the trichomes and then you filter it with micron bags and then you get like this bubble hash or bubble melt hash and then you smash it with heat and pressure and then that's the end result and the end result is a very terp terpy terp rich [ __ ] end result you know it is usually like whitish to brownish light brownish uh but the end result is very very good top of the line concentration you can get today is it's got to be live rosin so uh i figured i'd make a video comparing the two and yeah you know like i said it's not every day that i have live rosin in my inventory you know so uh i will get some close-ups on it but we're gonna be hitting it out of the smoke ski so let's just open this i do want to show you guys what they look like all right so we got the strawberry rose as you can see percentage right here eighty seven point five five percent tc not bad i will post the crosses post process but pretty much that's what it looks like i mean it's been picked up but definitely one of the the better raw garden strains that i've tried in a while you know don't get me wrong all of them taste pretty fire but this one stuck out very strong strawberry taste just all around good and then we got this one right here so this is the rosin as you can see right here the percentage of thc is not that as much as the live browsing but still very very tasty so let's open that for you guys sorry one hander so that's what it looks like not the greatest looking live rosing honestly it looks like some nasty crumble but i'll tell you right now the taste is there guys holy [ __ ] stevie really enjoyed this on the santa clara vlog those are what we're working with in this video i'm gonna take a hit of both and we're gonna see um i mean i kind of explained the differences between the two already now we're just gonna have to just hit the damn thing you know we're gonna turn on the smoke ski and uh we're just gonna let it rip i definitely used the [ __ ] out of the smoke ski yesterday so hopefully it's still running good it is that blue battery so might i add that this is awakened make as well so i won't go too too crazy but we are going to take some hits to say the least hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately i try my best to upload frequently so i appreciate you guys let's start that over again and uh let's take a hit so like i said i did try i tried these already strawberry rose phenomenal raw garden like uh if you're a fan of strawberry and you're a fan of raw garden i don't see why not you're not getting this uh because it's honestly one of them the raw gardens that stuck out to me most recently other guava cookies did too also but this one too so tasty still a little bit more in here i'm gonna finish that um but like i said as far as the taste goes very very refreshing uh very strong strawberry sweetness to it but as you can see it's 87 thc as well so it's definitely high up in terms of potency and the taste is there so i definitely would recommend for all you raw garden fans out there i'm saying this as i wear this sweater but good stuff let's clean that real quick let's take a hit of that all right take a hit of this live rosin about it i would like to mention is that when i put this onto the nail it kind of heats up faster than live res uh it starts bubbling quicker um i don't know if you guys notice that is too maybe it's the thinner in some ways i don't know but it just seems like it bubbles up quicker and it vaporizes quicker like starts bubbling quicker but cheers oh jesus okay there's something about live rosie it just tastes clean it could be just like the placebo of you knowing that it's solventless that you just you just think it's cleaner i don't know but it's for some reason it just tastes cleaner a lot more smoother the hits was faster that's why i cough but i feel like live rosin is but a bit more bearable in terms of uh smoothness or you know harshness so but with this video with the end of this video i will take this last hit and hopefully you did enjoy this video hopefully you learned something between the differences between live resin and live rosin because you know i would i would have loved to see someone make a video on this [ __ ] you know i'm saying i'm sure there's videos out there but there could be more you know so cheers this oh that is going to be the end of the video like i said hopefully you did learn something between the differences between live resin and live rosin you know there's a major difference in terms of price between the two so it's good that you know what makes them so different in terms of that major discrepancy and price you know what i'm saying but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] [Music] hey [Music] you", "NbfFlBy57GA": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane coming through today for another concentrate review it's a little wake and bake session for me just got about a half hour ago got another hour before I got ahead into work so I figured I would shoot a quick video today we are checking out a shatter from a concentrate company that we have never had a look at before here on the show this is from incredible extracts this is their Black Label so it says incredibly grown so I'm guessing that means this is their in-house so kind of their top tier product I've heard a lot about Incredibles this is actually my first time trying their stuff and as I said the first time we've had it on the show this particular stuff I got here is some sour band onine sour band is a strain sour band is a strain that I have not seen too much recently but a few years back it was real popular especially the area I was out in Bay Area California there was two shops in particularly out there that I hit that they used to grow the sour band and made a lot of different products from it some really really good sour band full melt but Dan and I used to go to those two places and we would smoke all kinds of different sour band it's usually gonna be a Sour Diesel head band cross I'm not sure what the oh nine is on this one I'm sure there's a few different cuts of it so it's probably just alluding to which cut it is so again this is a sour band oh nine go ahead and get a dab heat it up here guys go back and watch something funny I remember me and Dan doing a really big one time the only the only video on the channel we ever did in an accent I mean we did this our heads full melt bubble hash in a British accent pretty sure that's episode I want to say either 17 or 19 of the actual CCC episodes if you're at all interested or bored you can go back and watch that rocking the Jamie glass client today nice little spinner should give me pretty good flavor you got all cleaned up first out of the day it's always a good one always my favorite day of the day this stuff has a real beautiful look to it it's gone the you know the brown parchment so it's kind of a little bit more difficult to get a true sense of the color I should have thrown it on some white before I did the close-ups but it definitely is a really really nice light color the consistency is what I would call pulling snap these close-ups I took outside it was probably a little bit warmer than room temperature not super hot but you can tell us a nice pull and snap now that I've got two here inside it's definitely a little bit more of a shatter but it does have some gift to it did a nice fat one for the first day of the day yeah when I was doing the close-ups I opened it up earlier and I was smelling it outside I guess that would have been yesterday when I got home from work and when I was doing that close-up sight I took a whiff of it and it smelled good but it wasn't really a strong smell probably because I was outside that wind blowing and everything but opening it and smelling it now it definitely has a pretty good nose on it for just some regular shatter and I don't believe yeah this isn't a why present this is just their Black Label which again is the in-house no Grunch adder going on a DAB here this sour band [Music] I love them I find just the right place to film the video where I got the light coming in from the right direction we're gonna blow a cloud out it just smokes you guys out like the cool super smooth I didn't get a whole ton of flavor off of that Deb it was definitely like a nice subtle kind of more of like a creamy flavor the flavor I got off that dab wouldn't remind me of a sour or a headband there's gonna be you know more of a usually more of a fuelie kind of a more skunky a little bit more and I know this is the sour headband cam Terps are pretty distinct for me on the palate I didn't quite get that with this one what we'll try to get a little bit different temp one thing I've been noticing lately is certain stuff tastes better on certain temps you know I will attempt it a lot and you know as you guys see on the show but I also like to take something a little bit higher everyone somehow and you really want a nice thick full hit I don't like you know how to have it you know a scorcher but a little bit a little bit hotter to have to give you a little bit thicker clouds sometimes it's nice but I've been noticing on some strains I got smoking this I think it was gg4 great bake makes the other day and for some reason whenever I took a hot bath but it tasted really good like usually above a certain attempt to flavor of the dad but for whatever reason with that stuff I took a couple regular dabs and then I took a couple hot ones on accident i really like powers for some reason maybe I'll going all the hotter on this one it's kind of cool I really like their packaging real clean packaging came to the full-size sticker on the inside so it's kind of cool good for branding and whatnot it actually has the test results all right here on the back so it shows you know THC THC a CVD CPGs DBA terpene content this one comes in at 5.4 1% terpenes so that's pretty good you know seventy four point seven seven percent THC zero percent CBD I wouldn't expect to find a whole lot of CBD and sour or a headband in variant that's no surprise there but and then it's got eco-lodge Salmonella mold yeah so it's got all the testing and everything all the ingredients and everything right on the back real nice clean packaging definitely definitely digging that right here in these black sleeves I'll tell you what though this child's sealed the top it's got a picture of some scissors it definitely requires some serious scissors I busted out some kitchen shears that are in pretty good shape real heavy duty ones and it's it was a [ __ ] for me to cut through this thing so definitely good childproof packaging no doubt about that staff probably ready for me over here [Music] yeah I don't think it worked on that one that's a stop now right there you have to go in for another one Incredibles I guess a first time I've actually tried their products first time we've had them on the show I've been hearing about them for a long time though pretty much ever since I moved out here to Colorado they they are really digging in the edible game they do all kinds of different edibles I'm pretty sure they've been doing that a lot longer than they've been you know producing the hash mass quantity but they also make their own clothes loop machine pretty sure it's called the incredibles machine so this is incredible extracts and then they've got Incredibles which is the edibles and then I believe the machine is called Incredibles machine or something like that but uh yeah definitely these guys are you know all over the place doing a lot of different [ __ ] so it's pretty cool yeah the stuff you know this looks real nice smells nice I'm gonna get another dab here to kind of get a real full picture of the flavor on this one definitely already feeling a buzz sight in here like I say they're my first abs of the day so that's usually when I feel the effects the most is right in the morning and this stuff is setting in real real nicely behind the eyes yeah it's just my whole body my whole upper body especially my shoulder just feel kind of loose and a little bit tingly right now so definitely liking the buzz from this stuff I haven't been smoking a lot of just regular shatters lately it's smoking a lot of rosin and a lot of life present mainly but definitely you know pleased with this one decided to take a trip back to shatter Lin and do a video on some chatter because we hadn't done that in a while so I was definitely say I'm happy with this with this pick up the stuff quality final dab here [Music] got way more flavor on mountain you know - that's uh definitely still getting kind of like a creamy thing but there's a little bit of sour undertones in there too you just kind of get that diesel e finished where the first one I kind of just taste it a little bit of sweetness initially and then it went away that one I can still taste it just settle right on the palate so but yeah this shit's are definitely definitely some fire incredibles extracts pick this up grow life Colorado Springs and the other than that thank you guys for joining me for another episode of the CCC I'm Shane [Music]", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how

you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "DGgLALjkyLs": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com here today with a quick west coast week 2 review featuring alpine vapor and their gmo times bp9 hybrid live resin cannabis oil it's a vape cartridge it's a one gram 1000 milligram vape cartridge and my oh my i'm excited to try this i vape live resin every day i dab live resin about every other day and this is a limited edition run um from from alpine one of california's premier cannabis uh extraction companies and so i'm going to read a little bit about the packaging and kind of share some information i've got a battery here um we're going to dive right in so it says here our limited edition cartridges are craft candidates at its finest they're made using only pure live resin from sun grown cannabis these small batch releases are true to the natural aroma of the plant and are an exploration and taste outside the norm instructions you our cartridges are designed for use with 510 batteries inhale for two to four seconds for maximum flavor use at the lowest voltage setting on your alpine bakery now unfortunately on a previous review video i did use the battery at the lowest setting and it wasn't powerful enough to really really give the car what i would consider as the best representation of itself so i'm going to honestly move it up one twist on the voltage here for the battery so that way i can get slightly slightly warmer than the lowest temperature to make this really rip in terms of the gmo times the bp9 i do have a little bit of information it says gmo times banana punch number nine a true hybrid cut with cannabis cup lineage of purple punch banana og and gmo so this is going to be punchy og and gmo it says this cultivator yeah this cultivator is a great blend of sweet and sour with undertones of gas tropical fruit and curried spice that's a big claim so we're gonna see if i get that earthy spicy punchiness here we go how do i wanna i don't really wanna i don't really want to open it up from the top and ruin that beautiful stickers oh came right out there we go check it out all right so we've got we've got some terps in the jar here and the two i like it when it comes to the cartridge we've got a white ceramic and glass cart i love it we've got some nice chunky holes on the bottom right here that's where that pull is going to come through and be kind of sucking in the oil for lack of a better way to put it 510 thread brand new battery here literally brand new not even using the one that i used the other day this one is quite literally unopened all right beautiful packaging nice chunky battery here all right so one two three four five hits to turn it on branded it's on the lowest setting now i'll rip it just to show them that i just don't believe this battery is the right one at the lowest setting for this cartridge so i'm gonna do it it's not on too tight but it is sealed here we go chris you ready moment of truth absolutely nothing yet one two three four five try it again all right that's a five second rip right there kind of light in terms of the vapor and the flavor although it was there i didn't actually get enough of an inhale to really taste that much terps and so i'm going to go a seven second rip again on the lowest temperature try to give it another chance at 2.6 volts here we go all right so on that one a little bit more turks a little bit bigger cloud and what i'm really tasting is this light floral spice i'm getting a little bit of pine and a little bit of berry flavor the fact that i can get some actual good flavor on this lowest setting without a major cloud i think it's impressive um i am going to twist this over to let's call it one line two lines we're gonna go up to three volts here and we're going to see what that does maybe it maybe it burns it maybe it doesn't here we go it's definitely a different flavor and taste experience in terms of how it ends up in your mouth i feel like at a slightly higher temperature it gets a little bit more on the earthy spicy side comparatively to the light and floral so we've done three hits here i talked about that on the first hit you i gave it a second chance with the seven second uh blinker right there and then on this last one we turn it up to three volts three hits let's see what i'm thinking here for a score out of ten presentation appeal color taste potency i think this is really coming through and hitting nice um what i what i'd really like to see is some of the genetics information that's on you know the piece of paper need to make it on this i want to see the terpene profile i want to see some of that strain lineage and information it helps the consumer know what kind of high we're about to experience um in this box the presentation is very attractive i like i like the sticker i like the label i like the black and the shiny metallic i'm really attracted to this the color of the oil looks great um is this the best battery for this cartridge i don't believe so um the big my least favorite thing is the battery it doesn't match i don't think it powers this vape cartridge the right way um i've had better experiences with c cells classic just draw and pull on it um and so all things considered um would i recommend it yes more information there's solid information on here i'd like to know more about the genetics and the lineage and the terps um but with all that said i'm sitting here thinking this is an 8.75 it's a very solid high score i definitely believe that this is 100 sun grown flower cannabis you know pure live resin there's no distillate there's no popcorny experience to this no taste no that kind of flavor um but yeah the battery in my opinion is just really holding this experience back and so um we'll use this we'll use this battery again for the next review and i'm going to bring another battery on again to see if i get a better or different experience but for now let me know what you guys think 8.75 is my score big thank you to alpine vapor for working with this on the respect my region west coast we tour and don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel y'all i'll see you all down the road appreciate you guys peace", "0BVyOA5M4us": "what's up y'all it's your boy never not medicated you can call me mr clean if y'all are watching this on instagram check out that youtube if you're watching this on youtube peep the insta now we have a new brand today that i saw in my local dispensary and i was like i want to try that out they look interesting so here it is it is cresco never heard of them i don't know anything about them so uh let's get into it this liquid live resin rest indica i believe each uh strain has their own so like indica sativa or hybrid has their own name or whatever like a lot so like cannabis derived terpenes is a line so their lines are like indica is called rest all the indica cards say rest on them anyway so this is the lime sorbet coming in at you can't see but it is 73.4 percent it's just funny they give the [ __ ] thousands thousandths place for the [ __ ] i don't need that you know give me the hundredths anyway and at the bottom it has a nice little uh two things that will come in handy in a little bit so anyway so we push these in the back and then we pull from the sides pretty interesting way to do it and here is where it gets interesting this what can it there we go this little pamphlet if you open it up as you can see it matches with two of the things on here now that is the discovering our terpenes section which i thought was pretty interesting so it says that the terpenes here are clove slash herbal and floral slash pine when i think of floral i think of flowers so i don't i don't know either way here's the cart right as we pull it out right so anyway that's that's the whole thing about that 73 liquid live resin lime sorbet let's get into it pull it out here's the cresco cart pretty nice right i've been chiefing on it a little bit however i will say it did come with a decently big bubble i can't cap there it says cresco and there it says rest now as you can see it is dark we're going to take the cap off and we're throwing this on our superb battery because the superb battery milks and i've tried it with this cart as you as i said i have been smoking it a little bit and this [ __ ] [ __ ] milks the liquid live resin for stizzy to be honest some of the airflow through that is kind of bad so it's it's not as milky for tricks but this [ __ ] milks like this i've been chiefing i i haven't had too much like i said there was a fat bubble so it only came like it didn't come too full it was like to to there maybe but anyway let's get right into it lime sorbet let's get a [ __ ] thumbnail crisco y'all never tried them thought i wanted i wanted to not thought i wanted to thought i'd try him out so yeah cheers that was a bad first ghost i'm sorry for that however right off the bat you get a very not intense but i will say it's a very obvious taste you get of course the live resin taste you get that bud but you get a lime for sure you get a lime and a pine taste very different type of taste it kind of gives me a uh the lime and pine mix kind of reminds me of a cannabis derived terpenes uh cartridge or pod taste so that's a little bit interesting how the the combination of flavors causes for it to taste like a whole different type of anyway so yeah it it definitely i definitely taste the lime i don't know so much about the sorbet obviously that's the strain you're not gonna [ __ ] you know they just named it what sounded good it's not i'm rambling out of my [ __ ] cheeks right now anyway so with the lime sorbet it is a nice taste you definitely taste the lime it's definitely like a lemon lime though it's not like it's more it's got the the lime taste to it but it also has the sour hints you know so very nice though tastes like bud of course because it's live resin right now all the air is kind of rising in my room for some reason i don't know why but it's causing my ghost to be ass but like i said the cresco is when i when i first ripped it and put it on my superb battery i was like wow this [ __ ] is milking usually live resins i don't know it it does they don't tend to milk as much maybe it's airflow on all the live resin products but with most of the live resin different companies that i've had a lot of their stuff doesn't milk but of course it gives clouds it just doesn't like ball up to milk you know but i'm definitely feeling the cresco high already the live resin it is setting in which is surprising because usually from for uh like stizzy live resin it takes a little bit longer um but i feel like this one doesn't take that long you know which is nice i don't care either way i'm not i don't mind waiting you know it doesn't bother me but some people do some people want it instant like [ __ ] nicotine you know when you rip it you're oh [ __ ] nah i don't care the problem with these carts i will say it's not actually a problem but the the chamber is so big that the all that smoke you know when i as soon as i get my mouth off the tip all the smoke already is leaving i'm like no while i'm doing my ghost it's already leaving so i only get a little bit left um it's the live resin is super smooth i will say it is a bit harsh on the throat at points but it's all together it is it's very clean very nice i'm not like coughing it's well i could but i don't i more just have a dry throat the dogs anyway ignore my dog however so basically the high i'm getting from this is very intense uh eyes it's a severe indica eye high my eyes are super low-key they're super uh down to the ground and i'm like you know it's relaxing it's super nice but it's it's mostly intense why is she still going it's mostly intense on uh the eyes which i kind of like you know for the most part highs don't alter me too much you know like i can tell a high from a different high but they don't you know i'm not like out of my mind you know so when i get a nice like eye high i don't know it just feels different i like that i like the eye altering as you can see definitely milking but sad about that bubble that it came with if you've been following along you probably see originally that it came with a big bubble but bubble butt i didn't mean to say that but yeah cresco live resin if they're by you they're good i honestly like them you know i don't know if all of them come with a big bubble like i said this is my first time having them first time even hearing about them i i just saw them i was like interesting you know but i like the back push i think why isn't it working now i think it's cool you know back push instead of a side and i like the little terpene provider you know it's a nice little uh little uh trinket anyway so yeah this was lime sorbet liquid live resin from cresco hope you all enjoyed hope y'all were able to chief along if you don't have anything i'm sorry y'all you'll get some soon but if you do have stuff hope y'all were enjoying it with me if you see cresco check them out cheers by the way this is not sponsored last rip cheers all right enjoy i mean like the rest of your day or whatever cheers", "enz-OhEF6lA": "[Applause] [Music] uh [Music] i just picked up randy uh he's going to get a new bong because he's self-conscious about his dirty ass i'll just show you guys what i am embarrassed to like actually put this on but uh he said he wants to get a bong so i'm gonna take him to get a bung but the point of this video is this dollar dab i bought this a week ago still haven't done a video on it and uh hopefully i could split this in two depending on the size so i want to give him one as well but in my opinion to get the full effect you should do the whole thing that's what i was thinking yeah we'll see we'll see because it kind of it feels like it has some weight so we'll see we'll see we got rj we got rj subscribe to him if you haven't already he just got done doing a video yesterday with his cousin so it should be a good one whenever he does decide to pick it up he brought the forbidden fruit as well you know you've probably seen the video where we uh went and picked it up already fire stuff but yeah whatever i just gotta say man i hope you guys are enjoying your week um i have not been releasing as many videos as you guys do see uh but man there's a lot of reasons i don't want to digress into that right now but i hope you guys are patient with me and i am 25 so plenty of time yep so let's do it baby all right boys we are back showing what you got you know i'm saying a little a little uh what is it detachable one oh damn that noise oh dangerous let me put up here yeah you could switch it so you can go here oh it's in there oh whoa okay so it's a switchable beaker bung so you could hit it like a normal beaker bong or you could switch it off put that here put that there i think i like it this way it's like a science project right here so it's like you know homie's got to put some water in that yeah we got a new ball yep let's go baby yeah and also uh the homie picked up another one of these from that video uh the night the dispensary run the jetties yes the jetties uh legend legendary sky og sky og take a hit of this so yeah man i was about to get this rick and morty mom i'm not even a fan of rick and morty but i just saw the design on it it was for 35 bucks luckily i had the second greatest person here with me you know i'm saying no i'm just joking now but luckily andrew was there and he pointed out some other bombs you know for better price and not even that better design like on the bong itself so like i said this is only one dab so if it's not enough for me and randy to take we're gonna be taking other dabs alongside you know this video as well or in this video but the whole point of this video is to showcase this one dollar dab that i got from finos exactly a dollar out the door so oh nice let's see the functionality i'm gonna need more water so definitely gonna have a good time getting hot tonight as i play video games right here hold this all right how do you let me do this i'm uh i'm gonna showcase it hold up open it all right go so the strain is sour sandia uh the brand is bloom or something what is that boom or is it say here right there it's on the text bloom oil here boom something whatever i think it's the papers got it all messed up it's cool yeah i don't really care bloomfy bloomfire something bloomfire boom fire bloomfire something okay let's loom field you think yeah you're right okay yeah all right open it let's see what this looks like i'm excited to see what this looks like guys [ __ ] little dollar dad okay so i had this plastic i don't even know just twist that [ __ ] up feels like a fat rocks in there push down and turn oh there you go put pour on your hand the [ __ ] is that so we got one dollar dab you guys [Laughter] that's literally a one dollar debt okay this is for people who uh don't smoke as much i assume put the thing in there so i could prefer a thumbnail do you want to get better lighting what do you think this [ __ ] sun's [ __ ] is good here we go the [ __ ] is this there you go baby dab one dollar there so we had a one dollar dab as it looks like it looks it looks like it's for you know people who don't smoke as much and you're looking to you're in no how about this oh i think this is for more it's glass huh is this glass i think you just toss the whole thing in there yeah really i think so i'm just joking i don't know you don't burn all that that's [ __ ] plastic honey it's plastic that little rubber thing no not that or is there a read me i wonder if it's fire it's batter so you think you just put it in there you just i don't think you put all this in there no no not that green obviously i don't think i don't even think you put that glass piece into either think about it sure i don't know is there another youtube video no [ __ ] it won't we won't you want to light this for me yeah here i'm gonna put this back on so yeah it's not over i know i know so uh randy's gonna heat that up for me i'm gonna take this hit but yeah it pretty much looks like just one hit that's kind of lame to be honest you know you can't just grab it like that yeah here we go yeah my [ __ ] finger slime so uh i am gonna drop this in here but it is [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] so let's just cool it off a little bit you know if you want me to hold it for the camera for you or just leave it oh yeah yeah hold the hole hopefully it's the lighting i'll find out right now oh yeah i have to put it back yeah all right just this one yeah turn up the iso it's not bad let me see i already should not touch screen right so [ __ ] i'm scared all right ready [Music] it is you just drop it in there but uh we don't have a carb cap guys so we couldn't enjoy it as much but i definitely got a good hit man as you can see right here oh i wish i had a carb cap though but yeah that's really really cool that they did this yeah i feel like we should do that again with the car cab it's better at the end of the day batter can only go so far and when it cramps to like taste and stuff it probably wasn't going to get me too high but the idea of a one dab uh one dollar dab how are we going to get this out this is 12. that's cool dropping it yeah i can see that's becoming a thing i really can probably for people who are like just really interested in dabbing and don't know it's like if you have if you're if you have like a dollar at laying around why not right it's a it's a weird experience but it's cool yeah can you blow it out there hella higher because this is what i'm gonna do oh check this off watch out for the water though hold this here thank you for saying that boom oh crap it wasn't gonna go out today you know what i'm saying we're turning to the ground and i'm saying just like the sand it was before time i was gonna clean this this is mine it's cool so uh burn that uh let's pack you a hit of do i have my stuff on i'm not using this no you haven't tried this yet we're gonna give him this is the sherbert so i have a diamond i think that crack diamond oh did you say that diamonds aren't as tasty yeah man let us know if you guys tried that dollar dab or if you've heard of a dollar dab or anything like that similar or you know let us know in the comment section below yeah seriously though seriously though it looks like a phone experience for the dance for him that's a [ __ ] that's a dollar dad right there it's a [ __ ] fat one dude i want a light but dummy no i'm saying we're gonna take some dabs here and then we're probably gonna end the video here just uh a quick one i just wanted to showcase the dollar dab that was just the main focus of this video and honestly it was uh not bad at the end of the day it was only a dollar you know and if you don't want to tip your butt tender because he or she was an ass or not giving you the good [ __ ] spending on that instead of giving it a dollar to them you know i'm saying i don't know just some stuff to try out but look at all that remaining it was definitely a lot for a dollar with that you can see that's a all the excess stuff burning yeah we don't have a car kit huh huh we don't have a car kit we're [ __ ] what if we use this just kind of like oh yeah you can yeah right yeah i don't know why we didn't think about this [ __ ] wow damn it you have to be high first here give me that i don't know if i should do that yeah okay it's going in it's ready yeah cheers you guys hope you guys are enjoying the videos you watch continue to support my homie and yeah go up here more show them that droppage oh yeah oh yeah rainbow sherbet yeah it's smooth yeah yeah diamonds are not as harsh but yeah yeah good good call on this let me try that for ben frizzles [ __ ] yeah i wish i had thought about that earlier i'm stupid that's cool all right even though we didn't do i didn't do it i did tell you that the taste was there it was good it was good so excited we couldn't cap it for you guys though [ __ ] anyways damn you barely touched this yeah i know can you light it i told you i've been smoking the other one oh yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] that video you guys would have already seen by now maybe yeah if you guys see the basements that i bought that trash i'm trying to burn all of it all through it you know i'm trying to best for life trying to save the bet yeah the best for last you know best believe i wasn't gonna bring that out to the homie andrew that's [ __ ] disrespect bring that [ __ ] around scent you know what i'm saying so i was like nah i ain't gonna do it anyways so i only brought the [ __ ] the cart and my uh forbidden fruit and we have a good time for you guys man all right oh yeah try this car it's kind of clogged so it's all right uh in the video guys i said it was 100 uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "gA_u309IDA8": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing an avatar or avitas cured resin a cartridge all avatars as far as i know are single origin extracts and they make um distillates cured resin and live resin carts and pax pods as well so they're super high and super high quality from what i've seen so i haven't tried one before just do the price tag but i've been wanting to try one for a while so here's here it is and i'll give you a close-up and then try it out and let you know what i think [Music] let's try this thing out and read it um talk about it so forth so this is made by avatars which as i said seems to be a pretty high-end brand i've wanted to try them for some time um the strain is cherry og which i looked into it seems to be a mix of cherry thai afghan and lost coast og which all seem to be pretty old strains so this might be a fairly old strain as well this is single origin hybrid cured resin meaning it all comes from same grow of cherry og you're not getting a bunch of different growers people's cherry og so that adds to the price tag of these carts that's pretty exciting though uh that just makes you feel that much safer with what you're getting and know this proper um the strain and everything about it really it is cured resin i opted for cured resin over live resin because i'm actually one of the probably one of the few people who i think i like cured resin more than um lime resin i like i feel like generally a more complex taste and it has more more terpenes that live resin is usually overshadowed by like beta miracin pint um limonene a couple others like that where some of the heavier ones seem to stick around in the curing process and get more interesting ones so anyways um very nice looking packaging as you can see very sharp um these are i think 40 recreationally um i got mine i think it was like that'd be like 32 med and then i got 25 off that bringing it down to like i don't know what uh eight dollars off that twenty four dollars or so i know it's like 36 for the live resin then a little cheaper than both of these for they also have ultra which i think are distillate carts all of them are single source they're all a little pricey they all look really good so that's probably part of it oh okay let's get on the back first on the back you got cherry og one gram thc coming in at 82.3 percent or 823 milligrams for a container cbd is at loq um you've got 10 total terpenes in this and um okay and then you got thirty percent of that ten percent is beta cardiophiline i guess i'll just say that um what it is of the total thing it should be three percent beta cardiophiline one point nine percent selenidine one point one percent pinene one percent limonene one percent cedrol c-e-d-r-o-l i'm not familiar with that one that's exciting um nine point zero point nine percent humulene zero point six percent alpha cedrine and then alph um zero point five percent alpha terpenial so as you can see pretty complex and also a lot more terps that you don't really see so often oh weird anyways that's someone going down the street that's cool so this was made on what is seven um march april may june okay july i'm terrible with months sorry this was made on july 13th 2020 and tested on july 15th a little bit older than the other cards i've been getting but still not old at all really in the in cards i start wearing one they're about like a year older um you got light scale labs report id they even have the report id on here so you can look up their um lab reports how cool is that um and then they got the uid so you got everything there all the general info a lot of info on the terpenes which i like and potentially more if you look at light scale labs who they run a lot of tests or a test for a lot of companies around here a lot of the good ones especially i see use light scale labs and some lower end ones we'll use rose city but i don't think there's any real like correlation uh i think it's just a lot of lower end companies have a lot of like lines and brands like mana and lovely and um a lot of things like that so they probably just use the same people usually all right so when you open this up you got this which is super cool i probably should have showed you a close-up but i'll take a picture of it and post it in here too um let's see if focusing helps at all not too much but that's all right so what it says says avatars natural additive and flavoring free no pg vg or peg which is um okay i don't know i just uh don't remember the what that stands for but it's often used in vape vape juices and whatnot that says for best results store upright at 65 to 75 fahrenheit ensure the battery is fully charged for best taste use a 3.7 volt battery not recommended for refilling okay um and then you got same stuff but in like a little picture form got full battery 3.7 volts i think that's just the cart with a little up arrow saying store it up right and then at 65 to 75 degrees fahrenheit and then you also get this interesting thing definitely will know if you ever got a fake if anyone tried to fake these because these are pretty intricate little packages so you got that which kind of holds it up oh wow i'm gonna have to use scissors which luckily i have some right by yeah it looks like you gotta use scissors to open this there's really no easy way to open that might be able to find a way but i don't really see the need to so i'll just slice that and here you are really beautiful oil in there very very clean looking i know nothing wants to focus on this but that's alright and i'll take that sticker off like i always do very nice looking looks vaguely cloudy on the camera but it doesn't look like that in real life it's very very clear so again you get a jupiter c cell high quality c c-cell very no leaks or anything like that so all good jupiter is always fitting my vessel jupiter's fitting everything i swear those are some of the best cartridges you can get all right so it says for best results 3.7 volts which i'm 99 sure is going to be the um the middle setting on my vessel so let's try this out cherry og beautiful vapor production as usual with jupiter c cells that taste is so good damn that is a good good card right there it's already one of my favorites right now that's so good just an effect on everything so far or we'll see about effects i mean but like taste and vapor production that's smooth in the lungs and everything wow that is a solid cart high quality right there these might be like my new favorites a little pricey so it's hard to grab them as often but that is seriously good so it's a pretty clear taste too that's when you get i guess i don't know if it's from like single origin or just the quality of the production or what but i mean i have no problem like getting a good taste off that very very much like you got a very like earthy taste to it i lean heavily for earthy on this one which is weird it says it's mostly cardio filling um let me get that yeah now it's kind of like a not not very spicy because all the other terps and i don't know if it being cured matters at all but it's not a very spicy but it's very like earthy not very herbal but like very earthy um and then you got some nice cherry undertones see where they get the cherry from um yes i'm just like sweet cherry tom um i would say cherry because like usually there is definitely like a berry taste i'm not quite sure what ter what terpene it is but there's definitely like a berry taste that cannabis can produce and it usually reminds me of blueberry or like rasp kind of like raspberry but it's definitely like a heavier berry like a blue or something like that but this one's a lot sweeter and like a light way so it definitely reminds me of cherry i mean you can just see the vapor production on that that is intense it's got it they got it dialed in for 3.7 volts for sure that smells so good too that just like very light cherry after like an herbal tone or i mean a earthy tone that's crazy how clear that is so you know i buy a lot of i don't buy like a lot of low end cards except for the hushes but i don't expect flavor from those but these are just a whole whole different level um i didn't think about it till afterwards but these i think 40 bucks wreck we're a half gram these are four grams but we're a half gram half rock hash rosin cards i think it's live hash rosin that goes for 45 so next time i'm gonna buy one of these i might just go for a half gram live rosin to really get the best cart because but otherwise i think solventless these are some of the best cards their live resin cards are probably incredible um but i prefer cured resin as i said all right i'm close this video out thanks for watching everybody thank you avatar for making beautiful beautiful oils and great extracts like and subscribe um click the notification i don't know if you can do that do all this stuff that generally subscribers tell you to do i mean youtubers tell subscribers to do thanks and have a great day", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you subscribe this delivery

DGC scotty real and hanging out today have my buddy Damien from natty REM show up and man thanks showing up the bakery brother yeah no problem yeah actually thanks for showing up at the concentration celebration you know that was so much fun thanks for having us hey guys [ __ ] crushed it over there man has some beautiful contact UK cheesy all entered yeah that one's a great one it uh it tastes like a blueberry muffin and it's about like a like a 50/50 hybrid yeah it has us just [ __ ] is this man that's the banana couch livers and cartridge yeah this thing's fruity is all hell yeah that's why I invited him over I asked him he's got a fat has anything interesting going on and he says you got to taste the live resin cartridges and I've actually recently gotten into these I started buying a few different brands auditioning them but it's just Turkey as a [ __ ] and thank you so much as I'm surprising because I don't normally get super high off these and unfortunately I got super high before we're doing our interview so yeah let you know how it works but yeah delicious man the libraries and then that is a hundred percent pure uncut we don't put anything in it and we just keep it that way I'm gonna try to match like the turkey and profile as much as we can it didn't help me out with okay so the first cartridges that came out I completely dismissed them cuz I tasted on my taste propylene glycol I was at an event last night down in Denver and people were showing off their their new technology and I tasted a cart and it was just it tasted like bait juice it tasted like you know and I was just like dude I don't think you know I mean I don't want that [ __ ] yeah unfortunately like when when vape cartridges and pens are getting really popular if that's all you were tasting this PG and then people start cutting with dislike because of it cut similar right it was not as like harmful to your body as PG but now it's the point where we can have libraries and cartridges and then our next step personally is going to be a solvent cartridge as well all right interesting now now sama I hear these solvent lists newts all the time man that will only do solvent list and everything yeah I like them both I really do we do - honestly well most of our lives smokes butane or not butane but BHO and then a lot of us also smoke live rosin or don't let me hit this I'm gonna be I'll be too [ __ ] all right so what's it explain to me just because I'm trying to learn about cartridges I'm sure other people are what's the difference between the cheap cartridge at the dispensary in the AO and the $50 one it's all about quality there's a lot of companies that are more about quantity so that's the peak those are the guys that are cutting it would probably glycol and that kind of stuff yeah it's a lot easier it's a lot easier for your resin to get into that liquid form when you're cutting a PG or distillate so I could smoke it without it buttering or sugaring or crashing Lots inside the cartridge but we found a way where you don't have to mix it with any of that and you can just literally pour the live resin right into the pin and close it and give it to the customer a sick and that that's when these things have really evolved now I went to a concert recently just two nights ago and I'm normally used to having a bowl or a one-e-and and some container for flour or even if I have one of those pins you know if I got like a goby or something like that I got to go be I got the shatter that I'm loading it with I got something to get the wax off my fingers yeah these are [ __ ] easy and they're a little too easy but I just thought I was gonna hit one now I can easily smoke one of these cards she's just like sitting at home or right if it's the Durbin poison and writing like all the dishes in my entire house or love it you know all the tours so so this is just terpenes you get to like get to back to my education so when they when you distill or I'm sorry when you run something through a column you get what the I don't know how to like what they pick the Diamonds out of the terpenes and then they use the terpenes to make this sauce is that right or to make it live these parts with the with the live resin we're able to pack the column the shoot butane through the column right so what you get is the butane the cannabinoids and the terpenes and then you pull that butane out of the terpenes that cannabinoid right so then that's what we put into the pin so you're getting everything that you would get if you sucked like the diamonds and drank the sugar if you salt the butter anything like that but it's all in a cartridge now Varian just okay I love it I'm starting to get an understanding here so you said pull the butane out what's that wood residual butane and all that stuff is that something you got to worry about it's nothing that we have to worry about too much we've been in the game for a while over a century now and so we have over a century over a century and we're there for a hundred years no not centuries I told you these things it was him and Henry Ford it's our decade yeah no we actually have been in the company for a decade now and what we've been doing is like fine-tuning that tech so now we don't have any of those issues that's cool I mean it doesn't taste like anything but but turps honestly thank you yeah it's actually we try to match the exact terpene profile that you would get with the actual cannabis plant interest like a banana cush there's the Michelle gross banana that's what the banana cush is actually tasting like 1980s that's when the plant was produced and so that's why they named it banana cush because it was that banana that was hard to find at that time and when you say matched herpes I don't understand what that means um so when you smoke the plant or when you smoke the bud and it's like even from like the from the original breeder you're still gonna get around the same terpene profile sure and so what you smell in that grow is what we're trying to capture and keep inside that cartridge is what it's like a recipe um it's not a recipe it's like a it's like a natural recipe that the plant produces okay so you thought we're trying to keep it the entire time while preserving the terpene profile I'm not adding terpenes no just now I get it don't add anything yeah excellent makes sense man so we were talking about the big word the buzzword in our industry is vertical integration are you vertically integrated men and all that means is that do you have everything from your own grow to your own processing facility I guess sometimes it means your own dispensary right yes we're completely vertically integrated we do have outside processing on the side because you've good adding yeah so what doubt side processing means some growers ask you to process their [ __ ] yeah so we have a lot of companies similar to like it cut above where they will give us our fresh frozen and we will process that fresh frozen for them right and send it back to them so they could sell out their store but at the same time we also process our own in-house and that's about 95 to 90 percent of our in-house or all of our processing is in-house and so with that in-house then we sell all that wholesale throughout Colorado God so if I wanted a natty Rams cart I should ask for him by name though if you want an atom's car I suggest following us on Instagram you can sign up for a newsletter where we drop every week where we drop all the cartridges that's enough for a newsletter to get one of these made come on you got a store fine or something we also have a sore point deal that makes all right so as far as managing a grow as far as managing quality control I'll be I want to tell you a story that I got some edibles I've been getting into and actually going back to the dispensary recently got me some carts and got me some edibles and I tried this I said what's the most bang for the buck for edibles like 2000 milligrams in this tincture well I tried and it's bunk you know I mean just had nothing going on it and I'd [ __ ] drink half the bottle there's actually frightened for the first hour thinking it was gonna kick in I never did yeah it's all about quality control but I mean so and actually I went back to the dispensary who's my local dispenser really cool folks and I was like hey I want to show you guys this stuff seems like it's bunk no you can't even bring that in the store holy cow I can't give you a refund and it was like you realized what a yellow hour our hands are tied on doing business you know even the advertising credit card processing it's so difficult in business you know definitely well even as far as quality control how do you guys handle that well from grow all the way to selling and processing and getting it out the door there's always quality control so we start from the clone as it's growing there's always people checking it right and sure all the plants look good then as it's getting harvested and getting frozen there's another quality check and then as it's getting processed and then as it's getting created and then that's getting packaged in years out the door there's always the quality control check it's just even kind of corporate here man do you got white lab coats and stuff no it's not it's not very coke right it's more just the whole team cares like we all look at it we're always inspecting it even if we're not told to so you're hoping that we're just like naturally looking at smelling it making sure it's like the actual thing and it's not that we have that issue but there's so many different strains and there's there's always like different phenotype we'll checking making sure it's like everything that we want man I'm thinking I have a bamboo nursery a 20-acre bamboo nursery down in Florida can we do like 20 different varieties like I'm 20 different strains and I just think about the quality control that we have and what it really comes down to is if we lose a thousand plants that's a thousand plants you have to fungus or something that's a thousand plants that those guys work their ass off on it's also a matter of pride they're actually producing something so there's a you know it's just a inclination a pride to actually produce something amazing yeah we try to keep that tegrity and we tried to did you say tegrity yeah I love it a farm no but there's a we always try to keep that Tiger tea and we always try to make sure we give the love that each plant deserves just as if it was one of six plants in a basement so I guess it is but as you expand it's like you have to make sure that you are that efficient precise and so then you can slowly grow with the rest of the company yeah yeah you say slowly grow as the rest of the company yeah I know a bit gonna dunk your time I know about growing but I'm always interested in what's going on with this industry as far as what's going on like I don't know as far as I see Oklahoma blowing up now there's all the Michigan blowing up I'm a little bit confused about the state of the industry nobody gets to do interstate commerce anymore or ever I should say what do you guys think about that where do you see the industry in five years so they gotta open that up and I kind of national legalization what do you think I think it's gonna take around like three to five or even more years just for like that to switch over and basically because of the tax code that's with federal government right now is that way you know the more I think about it and the more I study it the more it just has to do with money or how they collect the money you think it'll take that long they're pretty good at figuring out how to collect money I don't know it's like since the beginning they always had a way for them to collect money even if we thought that all of our money was going to the public and it was going to for Denver is going to the homeless look even if we think all the money is going towards that they're still making good amount of money she's messed up in the in the system or in the industry then you get a fee and that fee is like out the door grabber aegis yeah yeah I've heard stuff goes yeah I've heard stories so a bedroll legalization who still stinks five years away four or five years away um I mean we're not holding our breath for right now right um it would be great if it did happen you all were looking forward to it yeah most companies I talk to her like hey and I'm doing just fine in this in this niche I just had a lot of money to get here yeah I'm not looking forward to competing what sold out what do you think about competing with I'm pretty confident that we can compete with them as we're growing we're getting more excited and our coffins is getting like bigger and bigger and it's been more than 10 years and we have just been sitting back and like making sure everything is exactly the way that we want it right we're out trying to jump a gun too quickly and in the next six months or so it's gonna start building a little bit bigger and then after that then I would in about two three years we plan to be in multiple states so yeah that's all it takes that long to [ __ ] expand huh yeah I mean I guess you got to get a grow set you got to get a location you gotta get like successor is that what the big the big hang-up is licenses yes they give you a license you can [ __ ] hit the ground running yeah it's just one of the first tube so you have to jump through just a interesting man so a dude if so if you could change anything if you were in charge of cannabis policy man any ideas man could you fix this get any big ideas if there was one big change I would try to have like all the companies in the cannabis industry try to work together cuz right now it's a lot of competition right and if we all actually work together and talk together then I think it would be easier for all the companies individually and how do you do that one it's such a hard product of just English you got such an that's hard it is tough I mean we try to set up as many meetings as we can with different companies and try to collaborate with them and like become like one solid team the beer companies do it though yeah the beer companies aren't all at each other's throat you go to a tap room and there's 25 different taps from 10 different you know 15 different breweries so here we're figuring away everybody's got to have their niche these are interesting it's y'all's niche yeah uh yeah I think I like it yeah yeah he's a nice easy chair everybody like said there's not even a button on it it's just one pole it's easy to get in man it's easy to get into a show or something like that anywhere you want let's go for concerts and events yeah obviously as a as a professional company because it's just that like you bring into a concert or anything like that but like it's the perfect thing all right I gotta ask man everybody's always even dreaming in prohibition land if I could just go to Colorado or California Michigan and work at a cannabis company man that'd be amazing that'd be living my dream almost like like winning a lottery don't yell don't uh don't wish for things that you don't understand yeah so is that something that if if I went to a cannabis company do I get to just smoke all day do I get to dab all day is it [ __ ] yeah no tell me about it first and then dabs later okay um we we always go in like early in the morning hit the ground running um just so we can get as much work as we can right into the end of the day and then after that you can relax and you can like with that we usually hang out with each other after work sure um but yeah we can hang out we could smoke and all that kind of stuff but yeah when it comes to work it's very straightforward we get stuff done he makes sense she just fired up what time you guys fired up in the morn then I got enough I was talking to because I was talking to an extract artist yesterday just ten hour shifts [ __ ] yeah our shifts on the rig this for personally for me I think I wake up around like 3:30 4 o'clock in the morning such as that and then guys are dedicated oh yeah yeah I start checking my email probably like around like 5:30 all right get into the grow around like 6:00 6:30 and then I'm there and sometimes until like 7 8 o'clock at night Jesus Christ man what happened out yeah geez how do you keep motivated like that it's insane well just like honestly it's great working in like our facility because everybody is like integrated so there's wrong in the lab and everybody works together around the same place so like if you look over and you see like a seven-foot plant I just got chopped down that goes by the harvest sure then like obviously like that's gonna get you hyped up because right oh man that's going straight to fresh frozen we're just gonna concentrate which might go on are these pens so is it ironic but you have to go into the bathroom and sneak some cokes to the pen then no just [ __ ] yeah kind of like the office with how many cameras are set up at the Grove for like yeah yeah oh it's actually some place so actually somebody put a meme up that was like you know back I deal 10 years ago I was hiding in the woods to try to smoke a you know a bowl with my friends yeah and now it's like you know 2019 it's like should I hit this pen and target yeah I love it the Internet is just probably like I'd say like the Internet is thriving just as much as the cannabis industry is right now share this from the tools we get are absolutely amazing you know like that you know being able to use Instagram being able yeah was that a kind of professionals association I don't know how they that man knows a bunch of cannabis professionals and I didn't have any business cards so just like nah just follow our instagram oops I need to do what's your Instagram I'll catch you there yeah mine's actually digital about sushi that's my personal llama but then I also run the natty rooms underscore Colorado beautiful Instagram page beautiful man beautiful so it's [ __ ] cool Manfred enjoy hanging out thank you though thanks for having me I got the chief on one of your pens all in Oriya delicious man I'm gonna go find one of these brother you can have that one deal I'm gonna go find another conclusion it'll find that part now I'm gonna go find another good hanging out thank you for having me so much goes for a rat natty rims yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] it says to do [Music] true medicine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "c9p8j4tiK0Q": "[Music] hey everyone eric here from peer pressure it has been a while since we've gotten a chance to do solventless review really excited to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the sullivan's pax pod but for those of you out there who also really just want to take a dab and that's the experience you want to have we've also got grams here as well and you guys are going to be

little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in

"it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like alright guys thank you for another video your boy Shaka if you don't know who I am my name is Shaka Zulu if you see my videos you haven't subscribed yet please subscribe subscribe and if you're new to the channel subscribe cos right I'm always coming with a good vibe doesn't love my videos mat now you might not love it you might love it I don't know keep watching and you'll find out but today as you can see from the title I bought I basically bought a live turkey and cart and I bought a live resin cart and I thought the live terpene cart was a live resin cart because when I went into the dispensary I went to a dispensary out and I think my desk I can't remember what the dismiss of his name was but when I went out to the dispensary I asked can I get one of your life resin what kind of life resins you got and she showed me the live it was a live terpenes actually it wasn't my present so I decided to do research on it and find out what's the difference between a live resin car in the live terpene cart so that's what you guys are going to get today but before I get into that this [ __ ] truck is made how [ __ ] I hope you guys can [ __ ] hear me but you already know your plea kind of start this off without bond rip you guys [Applause] [Music] buddy you gotta start to vlog off right with a bomb grip diet but yeah I'm probably gonna get out the car actually cuz I want to show you guys you're not wearing that to park that I'm app so cuz if you guys are on quarantine and you're scared to come outside or you just don't want to come outside you want to be extra safe I want y'all to get to see you know where I'm at so you feel like you're outside you feel me so you feel like you outside get your join get your bongs and go on a little walk with me out here and we're gonna talk about this live resin and live Terps guys but before that let me I got one more thing to tell you guys I'm coming off on 400 subscribers when I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do a Q&A video so if you have any Q&A questions put them down below I'm gonna try not to answer your questions I'm used to just answering people's questions so make it a serious question maybe even say it's a Q&A question if you can but if not I'll like it I'll like it but I won't reply and the reason why I'm not replying is because I want it to be a Q&A question for I want to save up some Q&A questions basically for my video but um let me get out here let me get my wax pan get that live resin I'm smoking on the the nut rot live resin it's berries and cream I forgot to say it in my video last time what the strain name actually was but it's berries and cream [ __ ] way go hi guys all right guys [Music] it's actually a good amount of people out here but I'm still working under a willow tree hopefully you can see I give you a quick overview all right guys the first difference is each stretch it's different than like you know your typical shatter crumble turps because it's two different extractions it's the process it's called a freeze frozen process where they extract and extract the wax before they actually care all right so when you chop down the plan you skip the whole curing process it helps preserve the terms and it also gives it that you know that flavor profile that comes straight from the flower that I roam that days you know I mean preserves all that although they do here the plant when they make terpenes on the other hand I'm gonna talk about terpenes now they the turps cards the live turf cards are usually way more fresh and are cleaner and less harsh on your throat because they take out the fats and the lip nodes the lip node another difference also up to is you can see the layer of terpenes in the jar when they make a so like you can actually take a dab of that term because the THC content is way different in fibrous and I think it's a less THC content so it but it gives you more but if I'm wrong people tell me I'm not I'm just going off of what I've been reading about the live resin and in the Terps the live resin turps because I do have a car a live resin Terp cart I got this car is called freak n abisco I think it's called I'll show you guys later but I haven't tried to get live resin nut cart you fit me snot Benz obviously prefer libraries and more than flavors and herbs but imma try both for both II for you guys but that's all I really know know about my present look at the difference between libraries and in terms I'm not I don't know that much more if you guys have any more information for sure put that [ __ ] down in the comments you guys already know I check out cuz I want to learn more about the libraries in interns honestly and the different methods of extracting because I've been one to make my own some [ __ ] to get like a press and make my own I'll be like next level but we'll see what's up but I'm going to show you guys that cart before I go cart it actually looks alright it looks like fish Jilla to me obviously because dish hill is more lighter and darker but it's the terms I honestly need to look up with this still it is someone comment the difference between dis jillion terms in the comments please I need to know all right guys see I'm gonna show you guys in a man let's help Wendy can't get a good like hit I hope you guys can see me it's kind of dark like cuz it feels like it's gonna rain but might not rain just gorgeous [Music] freak a nabisco freak a nabisco [Music] see the live resin is way way more darker than the live resin turps but it's still cool I mean we won't find out if it's good I'm gonna be honest with you guys if it's not good I'm not will tell you guys [Music] don't forget to Like comment subscribe more videos to come if you guys want me to try I guess I am gonna try it but man shout out to whoever told me I forgot who it was and my comments but you told me to try these now that's the reason why I got it I'm gonna try it out for you also I forgot to tell you guys if you made it to enter this video I'm just asking guys you know cuz 4:20 you can't really do anything you can't really go out anywhere I plan to go house somewhere but but you can't even go out anywhere right now so what do you guys want to see for 4/20 I kind of got some ideas got some edibles the con huh I think

work it in there you feel me but um thanks for watching the video guys seriously [Music]", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "PAk3eXM8VhU": "guess for starters let's put some water in the bond hey guys so today we are going to be sitting down and doing our second edition of flower versus concentrate the strain that we are going to be looking at it's going to be Girl Scout cookies or gse depending on where are you buying it from and what the hubbub about Girl Scout cookies versus GSC is I suppose the only reason I say that is because today somebody was just telling me that there has been like all of this hubbub and legal matters was surrounding the name Girl Scout cookies because I don't know trademark reasons Girl Scout cookie reasons I'm going to be sitting down and talking to you guys about the strain as a whole and talking about its effects in flower form and concentrate for him and then we're gonna choose which one I like better as a hybrid Girl Scout cookies is a really great middle-of-the-road strain great for the afternoons if you want to just hang out on the couch or if you're kind of indecisive but you just want to smoke a bong and you might get up and do something later I personally enjoy Girl Scout cookies most when I'm about to sit down and watch a movie and just kind of do mindless stuff for the rest of the day though again I do definitely like it as one of those strains were like I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna smoke it as if I'm going to be lazy and not do anything for the rest of the day but if for some reason I end up having to get up and go run errands or you know do something I'm not totally groggy and like in the couch from the strain I feel like Girl Scout cookies is one of those strains that has a very familiar look and smell to it like like when you see Girl Scout cookies and you smell it and you taste it you know it's Girl Scout cookies umm GSC just has this really vibrant green and orange look to it it's pastilles are very very like fluffy and orange and Girl Scout cookies is such a like sweet almost like fruity scent which is kind of funny because when I think of Girl Scout cookies I think of like thin mints or dozy doats but it totally does have a very like sweet fruity candy almost like aroma it's taste does kind of represent that sort of fruity candy taste but it definitely does have more of a cookie taste I guess you could call it so the parents trains of Girl Scout cookies are Durbin poison and OG Kush which are two strains that I've never had a chance to try before so I always find it interesting to come across what the parent strains of some of my personal favorites are and just to see whether they are strains that I'm a fan of or that I've even tried or heard of GSC has kind of made a name for itself in the medical marijuana community as being a pretty popular strain for just everyday stress and depression as well as it's been known to be a really great just body relaxing strain as well as like total mind relaxing as well so like I said Girl Scout cookies can kind of be in any time strain I personally like it in the afternoon however I can see it being a really good strain to start your day with a fewer person with super high anxiety or maybe really manic depression on days that I don't have a big to-do list Girl Scout cookies is definitely on my breakfast menu so in Flour forum I would have to say that Girl Scout cookies is one of my favorites overall I mean it just has a really great look a really great smell and a really great feel to it it's definitely one of the more popular flower strains on the market I have noticed as well now that we've covered the flour part of this video let's get right on into the concentrate part of the Girl Scout cookies I have transferred my concentrates just into this little oil slick because it's just easier to contain them than the packaging that never had provided so Girl Scout cookies as a wax definitely for me is different than Girl Scout cookies for me as a flower I noticed that I'm definitely a little bit more able to relax with the Girl Scout cookies flower like I could probably fall asleep whereas the concentrate form of it is definitely a little more upbeat I notice I always find it interesting how depending on whether you get a strain in flour or concentrate it will definitely affect you differently or it definitely affects me differently I notice I've definitely heard some people say that they think Girl Scout cookies has a sort of diesel e or fuel scent or taste to it I don't really get that in the flour however I definitely do get it in the wax form I feel like in the wax form it also has more of like a desert flavor versus like a candy or fruity flavor GSC is one of those strains it's almost like a triple threat between the way that it looks the way that it smells and like it's After Effects of smoking and using it um like I don't know I just feel like it's such it's such a common strain and it's just like hit home for so many people and gotten on there like top three favorites I definitely prefer the wax form of GSC for more upbeat things versus the plot the versus the flower form where I definitely would use that for more of like an evening on the couch or you know like I don't know crafts or something I can definitely see myself using the wax form for an afternoon yoga hanging out with friends or you know just kind of getting some light work done around the house nothing too major nothing that I need like a super sativa for but all right I'm gonna have myself one more dab and then we're gonna have to choose which I like better the flower or the concentrate form of GSC and today we are devin on our xlb glass rig that we got in seattle this thing is like I was just shopping cases before I was sitting down to record this video I'm so excited at the beginning of this video I really did think that I had my mind made up already whether I was going to like the flower or the concentrate form of the GSC better I mean I really really thought that it was going to be the flower I'm like I think you know actually I think it still is going to be the flower form of the GSC that I like better but like that dad really threw me for a loop like I'm blown away right now I think that the flower is going to be the winner winner chicken dinner of this flower versus concentrate episode with you guys I guess I'll call it an episode it's our second episode I feel like Girl Scout cookies for me in flower form is just like a really great end of the day kind of like melt away the stress of the day kind of just sit back on the couch and watch an episode of something and just relax the wax form was just like phenomenal I'm still just blown away by how how incredible that dab made me feel so that's always like something that I'm going to be keeping right up here thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you get a chance to try the both flower and concentrate form of GSC or Girl Scout cookies however you may like to call it and I will see you guys again for another episode of this hopefully it'll be a lot sooner than it took me to get in this one after the first episode which was the arcade a train wreck but alright I'll catch up with you guys later feel free to subscribe if you have not ready give me a thumbs up if you have not already put some words in that little comment box if you have not already and I will see you guys later", "2ZElSMBrXpo": "hey guys what's up welcome back to my\nchannel so in this video I'm gonna review a couple of products gonna be\ntalking about this vape cartridge from VidaCann which is a newish new\ndispensary here in the state of Florida this teeny tiny little vape battery like\ncompared to the Yocan UNI - I mean I love the Yocan UNI - this is what I\nuse all the time BUT if you want one that's really REALLY small keep watching. And then guys, at the end of the video, we're gonna have a little Q&A moment so\nI can answer some of the questions that I got from you guys recently when I\nasked you if there was anything you wanted to ask me and a lot of you were\nlike yeah well I think like 10 of you really yeah so but we're gonna do a\nlittle Q&A session at the end and I hope you guys like it also really quick I'm\njust gonna give you this disclaimer about the future of my channel I think\nthis is what we're gonna do moving forward feel like I've done a lot of\nproduct reviews ok I've done a lot of reviews like a lot of products a lot of\ncompanies a lot of reviews I'm thinking about going back to basics a little bit\nand not focusing so much on specific products but maybe more so talking about\nlike what it's like being a medical marijuana patient in Florida why do I\nuse medical marijuana how did you get your medical marijuana card in Florida\nthings like that so let me know what you think about that in the comments let me\nknow if you have any input on that let's get into this video ok guys\nso let's talk about this I'm gonna pray that I can say this right tikkun olam\ntikkun olam vape cartridge in the Alaska strain which is a sativa strain from\nvitae can and this is my first time buying from vitae can so let's talk\nabout what I liked about this a cartridge but let's start out with just\na little bit of information about the product from their website that we\nalready know about the product things to note about the vitae can beat cartridges\nthey're made with a co2 extraction method they're without any cutting agent\nso there's no MCT oil in there it's gonna be highly potent this is a 1\nmilliliter cart with 800 milligrams of THC which leads me to think it's about\n80 percent THC approximately I couldn't find an exact percentage for what this\nparticular batch of Bergers was but I think it's gonna be around 80 percents\n800 milligrams THC in a 1 gram or 1 milliliter cartridge can in addition to\nhaving no cutting agent these guys also have cannabis drive to terpenes\neverybody loves cannabis drive terpenes so that is exciting tell your mom tell\nyour friends also tell everyone you know there is a serious first-time deal\nif by it again it's such a good deal $55 off your first purchase as well as first\ntime free delivery can't be that right so let's talk about its taste and the\nfacts in everything like that this is an 80 percent THC cartridge or\napproximately 80 percent THC so it's pretty high it's pretty intense\nexpect euphoric effects you're gonna get lighten it's an 80 percent THC dose so\nbe careful especially preview with this but I found that I really liked this one\nit really does have a true achieve a sort of effect for me anyway it's called\nthe Alaska strain yes tikkun makes their own kind of strains\nwhich is cool but yeah it gave me more of an uplifted effect more of a sativa\nlike clear-headed effect and the taste and smell of this eight cartridge was\nsuper super natural it was it's just natural tasting I was expecting to taste\nmore of like a lemony limonene pine taste or something but it like it was\njust like super mild super super natural very natural it's a really natural taste\nand I love the taste of this thing it tastes very natural it's made with a co2\nextraction nothing like I said before as cannabis drive tripping mortgage a sport\nand you can get this one gram bait cartridge for like fifty five dollars if\nyou use the first time discount with vitae camp\nit's normally $110 I've had mine for about one week actually not exactly a\nweek now and this is where we are this is where we're at\nmy oil comes up to about here and it was fully filled when I got it it was filled\nto the top so now let's talk about this teeny tiny beet battery really quick\nbecause it is something else just tiny little vape battery that is so small and\nit actually looks like a little teddy bear I never liked a polar bear and I\ndon't know how to feel about that part of things it's kind of so cute that it\nfreaks me out so this is the lucky bear vape battery and it is so tiny it's less\nthan two inches long and if you remember the Uni battery I mean there are things\nthat the Uni has that this guy does not have but this thing is a lot smaller\nthan the Uni like look at the difference there I mean this is a battery this is\nthe whole battery so if we put our bait cartridge in here\nthis whole thing is so small so lightweight it's crazy so it only has\none heat setting the thing about this battery and the reason why I reviewed it\nis it has one really cool thing about it the one really cool thing about it is\nthat it is so small so it's the smallest to make battery that I've ever seen in\nthis kind of shape or at all I think it's really tiny if for some reason you\nwant a tiny tiny tiny date battery then I would definitely argue in the atman\nlucky berry it's so small if you don't like this little string thing - you\ncould probably just cut that off and I'll see why not like you just cut it\nreally close to where it attaches to the bear I don't really love it personally\nI'm not crazy about it at the same time I can see how it could be useful mean if\nyou're on the go and you need a really really small video battery and yours on\nthe go or whatever you might like this thing and I honestly think the pink\ncolors really cute there's a pink there's a white I think there's a black\nso check it out I'll put the link in the description definitely works with this\nand any 510 voted cartridge will work with the lucky bear let's get started on this part of video\nwhich is the Q&A section of the video all right guys so let me jump into these\nquestions that you guys had for me when I asked if there's anything that you\nguys wanted to know and if I skip over one of the ones that you asked go back\nto that post and check the by replied because I might reply to some of them on\nthere instead of in the video so someone basically asked if I found that vaping\nherb is faster or more effective for me with finding relief for my symptoms so I\nwould say it's not necessarily faster I don't know see I like to smoke my loose\nflower like I like to smoke my weed when I have it I don't really vape it too\nmuch I do have a little handheld vaporizer that I like but I hardly ever\nuse it it's just more I guess it's more like familiar for me to just smoke out\nof my bong or my pipe or something but that's what I do with my loose flower as\nfar as the question about any recommendations on affordable dry herb\nvaporizers I definitely invite anyone watching to give your two cents in the\ncomments because I don't really have a lot of experience with dry air\nvaporizers but I really liked this one called the high-low from white rhino I\ndo feel like the loose flower affects me differently than any of the bait\ncartridges or vape pens that I've used it's just a different experience smoking\nthan using the marijuana concentrate concentrates are just not the same as\nflower although they can be a lot stronger with THC I definitely say\nsmoking cannabis or using whole flower cannabis different experience from using\nany kind of vaping or cannabis oil I don't want to say it's necessarily\nfaster or more effective but like it's different so it could be more effective\nfor you I would think and someone asked me how hard is it to find how hard is it\nto find a job as a medical marijuana patient well I have trouble finding one\nif I'm using cannabis so it's illicit you can definitely still get a job a job\nif you're using cannabis like it just depends on what that job is and there's\ngonna be a lot of different factors that play into like whether you do or don't\nget a job and you use medical cannabis it all depends on a number of different\nfactors it depends on what kind of job you're trying to get whether or not that\nparticular company drug tests whether or not this company makes exceptions for\npatients that are using medical cannabis like and it's hard to find that out\nsometimes and you don't always want to ask that on the one hand it's a more\ndifficult and mentally difficult emotionally\ndifficult process because you do have to kind of ask yourself do I want to bring\nthis up and the interview do I want to mention it to them it's a good question\nfor me because I am not only a medical marijuana patient but obviously I post\nthese videos on the Internet so that makes me nervous sometimes when\nI go into job interviews right now I'm pursuing a job that is in the cannabis\nfield so more about that later guys if I get this job I'll let you know but we'll\nsee but yeah so it hasn't really hurt me yet\nI guess my short answer for that is it can be harder but it's possible you ever\nused cannabis before becoming a medical marijuana patient that is such a good\nquestion and yes but not really as much as you might think I'm pretty new to it\nin the sense that I dabbled in it when I was in it the first time I ever smoked\njust probably when I was like 16 or so when I was 17 I had like a stoner phase\nI was smoking quite a bit quite often those bored and I just wanted to when I\nwas like 17 I had a big stoner phase kind of gave it up when I was 18 to 19\nand one thing was I started to feel like every time I smoked any time any time I\nsmoked weed it would just make me feel anxious and make me feel uncomfortable\nand make me feel socially awkward so I kind of just stopped because of that I\nthought I just can't smoke weed like I'm just one of these people that just gets\nanxiety and I don't get the chilled out thing that other people get I react\ndifferently I get I get really anxious and I get really stressed out and I get\nself-conscious and I hate it so for a long time I didn't smoke between lines\nbetween the years of like my life that I was 18 and then up until I was like 23 I\ndidn't pick it back up until I became a medical marijuana patient basically so I\nwas starting to be dabble in and again and then I found out that you could\nbecome a medical marijuana patient and I was like that's perfect for me because I\ndon't really want to go and buy it from a dealer I don't really want to get in trouble\nwhy not just do it legally so yeah so that's how we got to this point I might\njust do one more question because there's a couple left I don't want to do\nall of these on cam I have other stuff I need to get done and I need to edit this\none and pose to it so let's just do one more did you have to have a long history\nof medical records to apply um so it I have to have a history of medical\nrecords I'm not sure if I could have gotten it without any medical records\nbut did I have to have a long history of medical records do not really know I\nused my records from my psychiatrist my psychiatrist I've been seeing sense I\nthink 2016 or 2017 so wasn't really that long but that doctor is who I've been\nseeing to move to where I live now and those documents supported the symptoms\nthat I was describing to my medical marijuana doctor and I believe that\nhelped her to allow me to be able to use medical marijuana so I definitely highly\nrecommend trying to get any documentation that you can of any\nanything pointing to your qualifying condition that's gonna allow your\ncannabis recommendation um get any of that documentation together ahead of\ntime before your first medical marijuana doctor appointment bring it with you or\nif you need to you can have your medical marijuana doctor usually or I have mine\nanyway ask for it from your doctor if you give them your doctor's information\nthey can usually do that amongst themselves but it helps and makes it\nfaster if you bring your documents with you so if you have anything bring it\nwith anyway guys I'm gonna finish answering the rest of your questions\nback over on that text post that I made before sorry that I didn't get to all of\nthem but I did have to fit in a couple of you know different things in this\nvideo so I'll catch you guys in the next one and like I said things are gonna get\na little bit different for just a second not a whole lot different but it's gonna\nget more generalized like I don't really want to do too many specific product\nreviews because I feel like we've kind of just done that and we're not it's\njust not really that exciting anymore for me so I wanted to do something else\nit's gonna keep me more interested and challenged and I still want to be able\nto help you guys and give helpful advice to anybody out there who's looking\nfind out more about medical marijuana in Florida so I'll keep you guys posted and\nI'll see you guys in the next video and thanks for watching this one if you\nliked it don't forget to hit the thumbs up thank you bye", "tNKG6YoPU5Q": "the only always good YouTube welcome to another live stream just hanging out taking some dabs tonight and the children really got too much [ __ ] going on waiting on a few parts to come in over the next couple of days so that I can go ahead and finish putting together the irrigation for this veg setup and once that comes in then I'll go ahead and put together the irrigation and get some seeds popped and start to show on the road those of you that saw my Instagram I posted the start of a DIY project to make some mini humidifiers one for each tier in here they're gonna be perfect for you closet growers or if you have a bed rack similar to mine small space you don't want to put a big bulky humidifier in there and like we talked about before there's not a lot of options for just straight power on power off humidifiers that are a small and portable as what I have in mind so anyways we'll get into that later tonight I cleaned up the old sexy gin tree rig I got the broken pieces of the grabbes Labs drop down out of here so all good and this still fits snug in there with no issues even though the you know tiny little bits of the bottom broke off no big deal so got the banger all cleaned up opaque bottom this is the deep dish third email from 710 coils so cake bottom if you guys need a discount code SB and v-love will get you 20 per 12 percent off of $40 or more so before we get fired up tonight though actually gonna go ahead and empty this because like my dad's to taste fresh super fresh so I got a little reclaimed jar here and all I do is take a little heat to it tip it over yeah I don't want to burn it I just want enough heat to facilitate a little bit of flow all it takes once it starts to flow in you can remove the heat just off grip on down it stops flowing you add a little bit more heat and keep the flow going that's it boys ask me how I do that my reclaim or whatever would I do with it this is it looking like dab some of y'all will probably take this reclaim came out very nice very clear it's not ugly and dirty it's more like distillate than reclaim this deep dish really makes it so that you're not sucking down a bunch of nasty reclaim into the neck of the banger you only get like vapor so I'm getting what I'm getting out of this is like [ __ ] almost like true distillate not the black nasty [ __ ] that's left at the body of your banger that people suck up from hitting it too hard and then that's it and then it's nice and ugly looking for a second and voila now this just now seeing you guys popping up in the comics what's going on guys and he switch over to live chat so I'm not getting trolled yeah I'm glad I did not break that [ __ ] I was thinking about oh I've got cuts on his hand okay rinses alcohol off oh Jesus [ __ ] that hurt I just did that inside - ah big well [ __ ] like cut right here like a paper cut from earlier she's five and I ain't gonna switch huh got my ass Kavi slipping right now bueno I don't need it to be alcohol doubt and all that I could if I was being super super picky but now that's good like that and we got a bunch of you claim in here and we'll keep collecting it until it's almost full and then I'll deep carb it and all and people say you don't have to deke our brief claim that's not entirely true we claim is not only a 100 percent d card sometimes you still have to hit it for like 10 or 15 minutes walk around a club which is dumb in your mouth stick map and take your tongue out see if I can't go switch see I wanna [ __ ] tell me what where do you see my where do you see my a girl beat at the max when you see man let's see if he burns himself ladies and gentlemen I usually don't so that means now would be a perfect time for it to happen now would be the perfect nope not today [Music] and I did it all safe like that because it's on the coils on right now that could have been bad so get my left [ __ ] hand clean real quick right now [Music] good enough for now all right yes chronic ale from Pizza port baby this is an amber ale it's delicious [Music] got my kuzey from la couleur saying people have made my reservoir chillers or my reservoir covers I'm such an [ __ ] I know you want to see this delicious pour don't you shout out to my man CV pouring it up on IG with an super super craft beers yeah buddy is it all fit in this [ __ ] little cup almost almost there's like a little cut horn cut hair left in here [Music] not my [ __ ] delicious let's go cheers you guys thanks for hanging out tonight you guys up to how was your weekend what did you do what's up Netflix you recommended [ __ ] I don't care about right now this jar shall we get it shall we Wow so I found out this run's changed on me over time so when I'm smoking this about three or four days ago it had a very nice sweet candy taste to it with a slight slight sour taste to it today I hid this [ __ ] not 405 I changed my temp up a little bit it tasted like I just got done eating a whole bag of lunch when I exhaled it blew my [ __ ] mind how much the temperature change and a few days was able to change what happens to the flavor profile [Music] you're already a DAB in oh my god you stop [ __ ] around [Music] [Music] [Music] look at how clean that is [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] the other runs it seemed like they got a little bit more of a intense candy flavor it was more of a just like a sweet taste with a slight candy you know but now it's like just straight bag of candy [Music] [Music] Wego somebody said they were already on their second dad I'll catch up don't worry I always do man what a great year whoa [Music] [Music] good well you guys I guess I'll fill you in on the projects I got going on yeah that's how I am dog I got that but I can't be any heightened ads I like them nice and low temp no I'm saying I can come back and hit it in 30 seconds if I need to yeah dad sneezes getting me to man it just depends on the Turks right all right so this all right we pull up Amazon right quick so the first project is the irrigation in here I got the pump in I showed that last time it's a share flow pump with the filter built in we're not building but there's a pre-filter on it so we're gonna be running this sure flow pump nice and small less than a hundred dollars and it kicks enough psi to run pressure compensating drippers like in my flower room with my big leader pump I could even run that room off of one of these isn't that crazy less than a hundred bucks if that liter pump fails I'm just gonna pick up another one of these and throw it in there it'll do the job so the rest of the connector pieces that I need to put this together are coming tomorrow and it's basically just a bunch of elbows in random fittings did I get into caps I got in caps yeah what I need to get now is more irrigation stuff for the big room so I guess I'll pull out the whiteboard I know I don't need it basically right now on each tray I have one irrigation line that runs down the center of the tray right and at the end of that I have my flush valve slash pressure gauge setup this was at the end of every line right what I'm going to be changing for the flower room now is instead of running the single line down the center of the tray I'm going to run a big u basically or a big circle all the way around the tray right so the line is going to come to the the table or someone drop from the ceiling down to the center of the tray it's going to go to a tee and it's going to basically go out to the sides of the trays elbow run down the length of the tray and it'll have the drippers along the length right for the plants on its respective side and then at the end instead of each line just coming to an end right it'll come back to Center and that's where I'll put this so what all I have to end up doing is I'm going to get across and basically what will happen is with the cross it'll be like this right so at the end of the tre imagine down there is the end of the tre this is the lateral flush valve it's going to be right in the very middle so I think here guys this view you can see this whole thing right imagine this is the end of the tre that's over there this is the end right so it'll sit like this boom right in the middle Wow this pressure gauge and then I'll have this lateral flush valve so that way every time that the system pressurizes it will pressurize all the way around faster more evenly and it just works that better way as a manifold and you have drippers and then i'll still be able to have the function of flushing the entire system out by having this in between and at the the lowest and so everything will flush down here and get fresh newts at the very beginning and it's also air relief so when the system fire is on any air that might have gotten into the system will escape from here too at the end of the line but I have air relief valves in various places in the plumbing in there that is one thing that's going to change that I should definitely show you guys shout out first off Roz rosin ink alright that's the homie Miami mango because I I learned a [ __ ] ton just from following his pages and going through and reading every post reading every comment every [ __ ] response like you have to read the comments you guys are so much gold hidden in the comments woodsheds my dude he does a lot of custom 3d printing stuff for me like my driver coolers science LED of course for my lights glob mob I'm actually wearing their shirt right now more rosin ink and hydro racks that is root riser you guys that is the company that does this vedric anyways nothing with that so here's my system in here all of this is going to stay the same I don't need to do anything in here this is a net afem disk filter that I have pre pump I'm going to throw in an additional filter post pump that'll be probably a leader filter and I'll throw that somewhere in here that way I have that I got this project box and I I just realized when I brought it in here I don't know how all that's gonna fit to be really really real like what I might end up doing is I might end up putting this and this on the outside and then putting everything else inside if I can fit these on there I will but I don't know it's gonna be tight maybe this these two and these two we'll see I might be able to pull it off but it's cool it's got space inside so those will be mounted on the outside and then I still have all this space inside so those will easily be able to fit and I'll be able to fit at least one power strip so we'll get all that taken care of I'm gonna go ahead and clean up some of the plumbing in here I don't really need to do any real design modifications other than I have different style air bleed valves for up there right now you can see I have like the Jane right there the ball ball type air relief valves kind of like the floor flex ones and then I run a hose down here in case they get stuck open it just goes back into the reservoir those suck ass I'm gonna switch those out for the plunger style which I'm gonna have to put into a bushing to fit into that top piece up there so that whole black piece will come out and I'll screw a bushing into the adapter and then I'll put the plunger into the adapter and it's a way better error relief valve I won't have to run hoses back they don't fail I got a reinforced put some more strut up and run all the clean lines and all that once I mount all this troll master [ __ ] in this box I have wire covers that I'm going to put up and shorten all the wires but I got all the [ __ ] new irrigation pretty much ready to go right there and the cubes floors been cleaned everything is pretty much ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and change the orientation of these lights tomorrow so I have like basically three continuous bars running the whole length of the room and those also are going to get their orientation change better spread Schaeffer fans are gonna get moved down about a foot and a half each that way they can put their main airflow underneath the fam instead of above and the canopy it will get all the airflow just you know basic [ __ ] cable maintenance type stuff that I'm gonna get to button up and create you know the control panel and [ __ ] for now and then I'm just waiting on the other four by twelve from American Grill products should be about a week or two now and then I'll go down there and pick that up come back up put it together it takes like 20-30 minutes to put together by myself and then we'll be ready to rock but first the beans are going to be going in here and I'm just waiting probably by Wednesday or Thursday I should have this entire thing done and I'll be able to go ahead and clean and sanitize do some IPM work prep these rooms to make sure that we're not gonna have any issues and then I'll pop beans probably over the weekend I'll germinate and we'll be good to go and then that way the following week I can just pretty much watch him you know do-do-do-do-do-do oh man I gotta catch up to these [ __ ] comments now all the 35 Pablo 31 I'm not a towel you are can of this way holy [ __ ] three grand a month four bills do you think he need all them lights oh yeah I mean all those lights why have the side lights when there's what kind of question is that that's like asking why have a girl suck your dick plan you could have two girls once I can dig in one second your boss oh oh [ __ ] mmm I think I'll take both please the sidelights they give you so much more like direct light to so much more surface area and canopy and it increases your yield significantly with very little wattage it's not hard to get too much light I just agree with you there you can you can you can get too much light real easy especially with LEDs which is why it's so important to measure your par or your ppfd right that's why I got the troll master part of me here which is integrated with those lights so it can automatically dim them down to the specific ppfd that i've said to please that's fun it beefs up the lowers the meds and the uppers and depending on your growing style how much you do foliate how tall you grow your plants etc etc they can really really be beneficial because some of that stuff that you maybe would consider chopping before will actually give you the same size knows is what you're getting up top and really I don't use it to concentrate on the lowers I use it to concentrate on the mid-to hires that way if you're getting in that side light they're not going to stretch as much anyways right and then also you're hitting the majority of the the bulk of the canopy that you want to hit alright than eating the potatoes you don't want to beef up the green beans you want to beef up the meat and potatoes you know I'm saying you know larf just depends on how you how you grow really right and know you don't get too much heat before you get too much light if you're growing with LEDs it's very easy to have light burn before you have heat stress any advice about your little tips during a soil grow so it depends I mean yellow tips could be a bunch of different things top of the plant or bottom of the plan so I'm watching the chat over here I realized we had 45 people in here cheers you guys if you if the tip sir yellow like at the end of the leaf just the end of the leaf if it's a light pale yellow that's usually a sign of a little bit of burn coming on or or it's the whole leaf is like looking pale it could be a deficiency but if your leaf is not like pale then it's most likely that the start of nutrient burn it's at the top of a very young plant then it's most likely a nitrogen deficiency that's starting as your plant is requiring more than it's getting older sounds like you're getting an immobile nutrient deficiency so I would start increasing well what is your ppm or sure EC you know whatever you're measuring it in right [ __ ] it let's do [ __ ] troubleshooting night we should just start doing that because people ask me questions anyways we might as well have a dedicated night or I come on here pour myself a beer have couple dabs and we'll just go through the questions and I'll just ask one person to help me queue up the questions we'll do it through zoom webinar actually you guys can put it in the Q&A boom our third of the Leafs are yellow then that sounds like it's probably I'd have to see a picture let's just put it that way you could post a picture to the chat right now with the Google photos link if you'd like and I can check it out and I could tell you what I think it is it's really hard to diagnose based off of people's innate descriptions so every light in that room is an LED oh [ __ ] warns in here sup Lauren gabs you know what we're gonna take it down because mr. Warren is it two times [ __ ] SB and he giveaway winner lucky month guess where he's got like a [ __ ] Lucky Charms guy shoved up his ass or something oh [ __ ] kill it [Music] [Music] but I forgot what I was about to pull up on my phone oh nothing I'll take down laptop this runs is wrong so strong straight up so oh you guys are talking about topping I am super excited for this next girl one of the first ways that were the first way I grew was from seed and I had the pleasure of learning how to manifold train and oh [ __ ] man I can bonsai [ __ ] out of my plants you want to talk about [ __ ] vegging for a while I used to veg my indoor plants for minimum three months in deep water culture my plants were [ __ ] monsters but I would just veg him in spirals I would top him I would end up with like an eight headed manifold and I would spiral all the heads if you go back on my youtube videos you could see when I used to run HP s with an LED in the center I had two plants that took up a 4x4 and one of them was a c99 that I just spiraled the [ __ ] that [ __ ] was dope but yeah I'm excited to be popping all these beans because beans give you the the word is escaping me the equal growth on both sides right your nodes are gonna be nice why my brain farting on that simple word what's the word sub DC shoes I appreciate the donation my man hashtag DC shoes everybody gabs up for DC and woman on this one oh yeah you guys see how hard I'm ripping those globs and I'm not getting anything down the neck but pure vapor look at that nice ass reclaim / distillate vapor we're getting down there yes it is delicious you renounce your mad dabber crown to me [Music] you know a lot of the times what makes me have to call mid DAP is the fact that my saliva or mucus starts accumulating mid dab due to all the Turks and that post nasal drip just instantly makes me want to like gag and cough [Music] [Music] fool wiggle bigger [Music] clear my turf caves using all that [ __ ] out of there you do it put a Terps I ain't gonna do it do put Turks I ain't gonna do it so when did I start Spanky Pablo for the compliment on the rig I said gingery recycling the taste profile is like sweet candy runs and depending on you know what temp you hear that what your ramp up is on how he eats up all that [ __ ] yeah that's what's in my Amber glass here this is what I always use first is dark crystal I only use a little bit alight so right now to see if I can get a little mark off network the glitter the drip drip yeah I like all my little opals there's opals everywhere and then I haven't even pulled out the bad weather the dabber I use you made this custom to go with it carp cap diverse little nasty dirty right now but man [Music] Thank You loan yeah so I started growing pretty much at the end of 2014 beginning of 2015 I started growing in a 4x4 tent with the 600 watt HPS deep water culture and 110 gallon tote with two beans from I love growing marijuana calm who strain was gold leaf cross of alka poco gold in something else I think but it was [ __ ] huge I got quite a bit I got like 21 ounces or some [ __ ] it was cool we should see some of the the other pictures from that that I didn't post on Instagram some funny [ __ ] yeah I'm [ __ ] high [ __ ] man that [ __ ] me up so here is my first grow it was bad but in that at all I ended up washing some of it too and then pictures of my first wash it's not so great you guys not so great and I think I just washed popcorn Doug's I'm trying to see where's that uh affordable picture the top cola was [ __ ] like I [ __ ] you not I waited I'm just gonna show you cuz you guys wanna [ __ ] believe me that I thought I waited [ __ ] huge man look at that [ __ ] crazy are the roots on them with a [ __ ] dog I was running GH newts back then one plant just completely triumphs the other two [ __ ] bananas I was doing stupid [ __ ] with the [ __ ] look at that monster bugs on that thing what are all the dots on the the pieces of leaf that were trimmed all the way Oh uh-huh yeah I was I was pretty happy with that for the first girl it was a [ __ ] it was a hairy string uh-huh I thought it was partly because of how I grew it but I reached out to I loved growing marijuana and they said I did good there was definitely some things I could have done a lot [ __ ] better holy [ __ ] but man that was fun and I used to pop seeds and put them straight into neoprene collars and into dwc I know there's probably quite a few of you guys that do it but now I just wait until the taproot got long and just slide it straight into neoprene and go straight into help onyx or DWC that [ __ ] was fun ladies through experiment so [ __ ] much like it ridiculous ridiculous how much I used to experiment but I did it because I knew like if I got all my experimenting over at the beginning then I wouldn't have to worry about it later on I would be profitable you know what I'm saying cuz if you don't fail first and you just have nothing but success you're gonna get ahead of yourself and you're gonna trip on your own feet but if you trip on your own feet enough and you figure out all the [ __ ] kinks and you learn how to think ahead on certain things you figure out what works what doesn't work what scales up well and what doesn't right like aeroponics was amazing for me but I learned after experimenting with trying to run a whole room with it it it doesn't scale up well it just does it um you know it just doesn't scale up period there's no other way to put it I'm especially with the way that I was trying to do it and my limited resources it was strictly like reinvest reinvest reinvest reinvest so that I can constantly add more equipment add more plants add more space you know and I [ __ ] you not it just took about it took till about a year ago for me to get to where I was able to have this amount of space to grow and this is like [ __ ] man I'm like a hermit crab in here it's like a shell on my back it's not very big when we move and I grow like and I build a new facility then I'm gonna have like a couple of rooms you know but this is just I did once oil grow yeah hydros where it's at you guys here's what I'll tell you about soil I used some cool RIT sub cool I used his 2017 super soil recipe I cooked it for about two and a half months and then I did a piss-poor half-assed grow under like some [ __ ] tea vibes or something and that I maybe finished it under C mhm I didn't give it a fair shot at all and the results were actually really [ __ ] good given the fact that I didn't even bother to water it that much you know let alone give it teas or amendments or proper light even you know the terpene profile on it was something I grew gorilla glue number four it was something that I had grown numerous times and various hydroponic setups in the rooms under different lights and nutrients and I was very good at growing it and so I ran that and the Turk profile was completely different hold on I got to plug in his GoPro and it's like okay there we go the Turk profile is completely different it was less on the gas side and more on the chocolatey diesel earthy side it had like a chocolate ty type vibe to it and it was [ __ ] delicious and I could still taste you know the the Turk profile that I get from hydro it was still there but it wasn't the dominating terpene profile wasn't the main thing it was just chocolate II earthy a little bit of gassy just but really chocolaty and sweet and it was it was great um the effects for the high I can't say that I noticed anything you know noticeably different but I hadn't had any hydro to do a side-by-side comparison so um I would run soil again but if I were to do soil I would probably be pretty conflicted on whether I went with a potted system or like just doing beds I think for me if I were to do something in the soil I would dedicate just one room to LEDs and soil and it would be beds I would have to do beds and it would be kind of like a living soil otherwise I don't think there's a point you know it doesn't have to be like oh no till bla bla bla bla bla na man like you know working a little bit but it doesn't have to be you know I don't know see that's where I'm like inflict it on f2 because I'm not a soil guy so I'm not gonna be hardcore about one thing or another i'ma look at it from an analytical perspective and be like hmm how can I eliminate some risk here cuz there's a [ __ ] ton of horrible pests that you can have it's hard to fight them with being sterile so that's out of the option anyways if you're running soil there's no point in being sterile right but then again you can run just microbes and like like what's the [ __ ] mosquito microbe killer that I run whatever that is I forgot what it's called but you could run Mike and Vinnies and nematodes and just specific predatory mites and other insects without it being like a complete no-till living soil you know you could just be very precise with the things that you use to minimize your risk of other bad pests but it's just such a gamble man I am look in my room now and it's like I let it sit after-hours for a whole week without cleaning it and I still didn't even get it bugs in there you know what I'm saying because of how I built the room and I don't run dirty ass soil so I run rock wall and I run I ran my last friend sterile because I wanted to give it a fair shot I will never do it again mark my words all my years in all my different ways of growing I have always ran hydroponics with beneficial bacteria and microbes right and I've done it in various ways I've handed it to the reservoir not top that'd only I've done foliar applications I don't wrenches and dunks then all types of [ __ ] right and I was like all right let me try going sterile [ __ ] that I don't care how white your roots are there is a symbiosis that is happened in the evolution of this plant between these beneficial bacteria that exist in the soil where they evolve that and it creates a terpene expression in the plant that is unavailable if you are sterile hands down if you compare a hydro grower whose recipe is exactly the same - the microbes one go sterile and one goes Bennie's you're gonna have different terpene expressions the room everything can be exactly the same it could be the same exact bro you know what I'm saying I could decide not to apply beneficials to half of my plants next grow and the difference would be apparent and the growth the vigor right the health of the roots and just the overall final product the terpene expression would be different right with the potency be different I've never had anything tested for potency I will going forward but before I have it so now that I'm getting ready to pop seeds I'm probably gonna have a [ __ ] ton of testing done you know but we'll see we will see but Vinnie's absolutely absolutely absolutely will never run without them yet this lady here is yeah and [ __ ] snapped out as different environment will give you different chirps yeah but the environment would have to be vastly different to for that to happen you're talking it would have to be probably a delta of a continuous fiber or more Fahrenheit you know you're talking a room that has proper a/c and ventilation versus a room that doesn't yeah you're probably gonna have some different terpene expressions they're absolutely Stoney's [ __ ] right on the money on that different immuno responses from the plan are going to trigger different terpene responses right I like my best results always came from running this super brew that my mentor taught me I have the recipe say it was the latest recipe he ever gave me before I he told me dude you're like smarter than me now you're better than me now you're doing more research than me now you should just go and find somebody else or start teaching somebody and I was like [ __ ] really you're not gonna teach me anymore your tricks and he was like dude just pick a girl and [ __ ] out now you got it I was like all right I haven't talked to him since then other than an occasional hey man how you been but it's been like probably two or three years so let me see what was up [ __ ] was I gonna pull up that run Scottie super booth thank you I looked back at the [ __ ] thing and you had it all right let me pull up my Google Drive it's a venti recipe it uses multiple things alright I'm gonna give you guys the [ __ ] lowdown recipe right now you choose to use this if you want or not here's the [ __ ] deal the recipe is you're gonna need great white gh subculture M G H subculture B aqua shield or hydro guard GH floor blend and a sugar source you can use molasses or a hydro sweetener or turbinado you're going to put all this into a makeshift bioreactor so basically it's gonna be cool between roughly 60 to 68 degrees super bubbled and stirred or through a water pump right but if you use a water pump that's going to heat it up over time therefore you need to be using a chiller or keep it in an environment where it's still going to maintain a cool enough temperature and it needs to be light proof recommended to use RO water but any non-chlorinated source is okay everything is going to be represented in teaspoons per gallon you're gonna use a quarter teaspoon of great white per gallon you're going to use an eighth of a teaspoon each of gh subculture in and be 1/8 each per gallon and eighth of a teaspoon right then you're gonna use anywhere between 10 to 15 MLS per gallon of your hydro garden or your aqua shield all right that's your bacillus okay it's gonna keep the bad beneficials from growing okay depending on how warm your tea mixture is you're gonna want to use more Irish hydro garde right if it's warmer use more it's cooler you don't have to use as much you're gonna use one ml per gallon of flora blend which is a pre blended tea now this was all created back before Monsanto and blah blah blah and GH was taken over and sold and blah blah blah right so if you have issues with GH then find alternatives to what these are just look them up see what they are and then find alternatives all right but for a sugar source you're going to use a half a teaspoon to a teaspoon it depends on the bricks of your sugar source and the temperature of the brew the warmer it is the less sugar you need but the less time you have before your tea expires alright so real quick quarter teaspoon of great white eighth of teaspoon of G H M eighth of a teaspoon of GHB and then 10 to 15 MLS of hydro garden or aqua shield one ml of flora blend and then 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of your sugar source you're going to mix it all together and put it into your bioreactor or whatever you have to brew it let it brew for 24 hours so that it has time to replicate itself into useful proportions aka colonize doing that will make it last much longer and then depending on the temperature and how well you keep it mixed and hair rated it will last anywhere from 6 to 14 days it should always smell natural like the earth maybe a little bit sweet if it starts to smell nasty like something is rotting or foul it's bad scrub the bucket between fresh batches and you'll also want to scrub and clean the air stone for each fresh batch to the bacteria will colonize and form what looks like dark brown or black spots it's not a bad thing it's just colonized beneficial bacteria unless the smell is bad the instructions for use you can apply to all stages of growth including cloning which I used to do I would add some into my cloning mixture and that's all I would add and with maybe a little bit of cal-mag and my clones would have roots within four to five days I [ __ ] you not so you could apply it seedlings clones veg or bloom you add 8 to 10 ounces every 3 to 5 days and with fresh bedding on what you're growing and I guess right if you get too much of a buildup of beneficial bacteria colonies and your reservoir or on your medium you're using too much and or adding it too often and you shouldn't have to scrub your air stone in your plant reservoir until after the grow if you're adding it to like a DWC reservoir you only need to add a small amount if you have to scrub your air stone you're adding too much it shouldn't colonize in your reservoir like that now the way that I would apply that is I would apply that to rock wool via top feed just 3 to 5 ounces per cube at most probably once - twice a week hand-fed that way none of it is in the irrigation system none of it is in the reservoir the reservoir remain sterile running Athena AG Plains or any other hypochlorous acid and/or a citric acid to keep your irrigation lines clean and your mineral deposits from building up so if you run the proper amount of maintenance which would be maybe like three to five MLS per gallon at most of like a hypochlorous or citric acid I would run the hypo versus a citric right you can still run beneficials in your medium and that hypochlorous acid will not be enough to break down and kill those microbes but because in rock Woollett inert medium and you're pretty much feeding until you get runoff every day you need to make sure that you have colonization on the roots at least so you always feed those microbes right at the top of the crown to maybe one to two times per week is really all you need and those microbes will continue to colonize on the roots and even though the medium is being fed and somewhat flushed as long as you're not over watering you shouldn't be pretty much wiping out the beneficials they should still exist in the medium to an extent and recolonize every time that you reapply but they should never be completely wiped out but you keep it out of your irrigation and out of your reservoir your reservoir doesn't get messy or nastiest a sterile stays clean you know and if you want you can even do like a once a week dose of like - peroxide like medical grid right like maybe one ml per gallon two MLS per gallon once a week once every two weeks it'll help knock down any issues that you might have with a build so why is it that stony you're saying that molasses doesn't feed microbes why is that a big misunderstanding [Music] [Music] [Music] this isn't growing 101 what's wrong dad [Music] you don't like the tea lesson [Music] you were talking to a cat well I think it just depends on how much molasses you use and what type of molasses I think it's important to note that you have to use an unsupportable asses if you're just using regular molasses a lot of times it does contain sulfur right there's different types of molasses and there are certain ones that are specific for brewing teas but you can get so like a Blackstrap so for free molasses is what you want and like I said it's a small amount depending on how much you're using right how big the batch is what the temperature is what would you recommend as a better so brown sugar fish and brown sugar so how is how can how can a food source be too strong I'm not being argumentative at all I'm being inquisitive because you're the organics guy I'm a hydro guy my usage with microbes is very limited in comparison to ours so we need to be clear I'm coming at you in a humble inquisitive way please tell me how oh yeah TAC wavy [Music] [Music] window shopper I got a flash it out of here on me and sulfur I'm just yeah I'm just curious so oh you just heard it then go to molasses and goddammit you was just talking out your ass then [ __ ] outta here with that oh no I'm just repeating somebody told me funny that's funny [ __ ] say dad I'm [ __ ] bidding two times it's only ten [Music] [Music] oh I'm sorry I'm high three [ __ ] high [Music] dude nobody's holidays so you're you're new to the channel I think so stone you like this channel is all about breaking stoner myths and forum [ __ ] right like obviously there's great lessons that have been learned from anecdotal evidence and experience passed down and experienced through multiple growers right but at the same time there's something to be said for verifying that via science and and developing an understanding for it right so that's basically my channel is about breaking through the [ __ ] and finding out the whys how comes what Fuller's all the [ __ ] right and figuring out if there's any scientific actual you know evidence behind it and then you know that way I can research it I can understand it and once I have a firm understanding of it then I feel confident and speaking about it but until then I never speak out of lane you know I always become things that I feel like I've studied from a scientific peer review like scholarly sources me verified study do you know but there's a lot of stuff in cannabis that hasn't had no scholarly peer reviewed you know research studies on and there's not journal articles on a lot of that stuff is only available outside of the US because there's censorship in the US and you can't reach it because it's you know it's blocked off right you have to look to the Netherlands and a lot of places over these that are doing research israel [ __ ] like that nobody saying you're talking out of your ass don't you know don't take it the wrong way let me finish what I'm saying let me finish what I'm saying so what I'm saying is we welcome an open conversation here we welcome multiple points of views we welcome the debate right like I tell people not every disagreement has to be an argument right you can agree to disagree but you can still have an open discourse about it and try to seek some type of understanding or if if all else fails even if you agree to disagree maybe you walk away with something to chew on and then later you experience something that connects the dots for what that person was telling you and then you're able to understand it in a way that makes sense and then you're able to use it to your benefit right so everybody here is very open-minded we're not argumentative we're super chill and low-key positive vibes only we welcome the conversation so don't feel defensive or like nobody's coming at you because that's totally not it everybody here just wants to learn everybody here is eager learn the facts and learn [ __ ] that's gonna hold true not [ __ ] you know what I'm saying we want to be able to verify it that's all so don't feel like nobody's coming at you dog it's not like that this isn't that Channel you want to through some nugs all right you guys are asking me about what the dry and the cure you guys realize the dry and and cures done already right completely done yeah man it's it's hard to pick up the vibes sometimes when people come in here it's all gonna do it what's up magic have ad for micro crocked what do you mean micro crops you mean like having like perpetual like multiple harvest in the room or I'm an owner in the [ __ ] all the time you guys other [ __ ] everyday when somebody comes in here and tells me something I don't know and I'm so happy to learn it I'm so grateful to that person because I do so much research it's like sometimes I feel like I know a lot but then when I speak to other people that grow from you know other areas right not even different methods just other areas and learn about the challenges they face I realized damn there's a lot of different perspectives for their [ __ ] that changes just depending on where you are you know I'm saying indoor-outdoor [ __ ] hydro lor soil it gets even deeper than that right the no-till [ __ ] guys versus the regular soil guys and still put bottles loose in there's so many different avenues man it all depends on what lens you're looking through that's all that matters right I just try and absorb [ __ ] information from every angle I can and bottle that [ __ ] up in my own way and then just use it whatever way I see fit that's that's honestly if you can learn from everybody I see too many people snub their noses up at one way of growing or they'll [ __ ] it and look down on somebody because they have a smaller grow or they grow in a tent man if you can't learn something from everybody then you're a dumbass I'll say that again if you can't learn one thing from everybody then you're a dumbass so if you don't listen to what other people have to say then like here it's shutting off your own sources of information it's stupid people gotta learn how to be more open everybody so [ __ ] defensive in this day and age everybody so quick to be like you're attacking me or oh you're gonna get offended or oh I'm offended it's like and y'all got a desensitize and [ __ ] sinning yourself [Music] but you guys wanted to see what's up with the hardest so let me change my battery real quick I got a fresh one right here what's my person 12% should be enough hell yeah but anyone can [ __ ] it up so that's right so my garage is a little messy right now because of the harvest I got to call it dumpster to come so I could throw away everything so check it I did it dry for about seven days and then took it all down and cut it straight into here so that's some runt that's some run this is from the TfL lighting side the GoPro doesn't okis well but this is 507 we got a bunch in here and then I think all the raging oh this is a raging push side you can see the frost on the bottom of the bag of the ragin cush it's just visibly there more right there you can see all of that [ __ ] look at that that ragin cush puts out some [ __ ] trikes man there any on these [ __ ] TfL a little bit but not as much I'm telling you man the blue spectrum in the rating cush holy [ __ ] it just puts out these [ __ ] trikes I think I need a bigger box it's coming on the 27th until then it's Tetris baby before I start this next girl I swear to god I'm gonna finish the outside of this wall that's okay it's so [ __ ] early one in all the vapors all right okay I'll show you guys the room it's still on reset mode I'm not done yet I already come in here I did I did way earlier I'm excited to run these these are new this grow these are the six by six by four Jumbo's these are their new ones to extended to cases summer run those and these are new drippers last time I ran to gowing per hour because mango tech said those would be the best because they don't fog that's what he runs but they get water channeling so I'm around those oh my god my battery is dying so fast as I stand here and talk hold on maybe all right if it dies I'll be right back all right battery's out a hundred percent what Dad Matt which one oh yeah another piece of the puzzle came today for the bed you set up told you guys the condensate pump would come if you guys want to know what is the best condensate pump in the game the best bang for your buck it will pump probably as high as any home grower needs to go this is it [Music] diversity CP 22 okay this thing is awesome got an alarm indicator it shows running indicator it has an auto shutoff if you want to hook it up to a condensate if this thing fails it'll automatically shut off your AC so that it doesn't flood or your D hue so it doesn't flood it has a built-in fan so that doesn't overheat if it runs constantly it has like a 20 foot head I think which means you can lift it cuny 20 feet up in the air main rain or main only alright so we're gonna have another lesson I see this is the moneymaker right here they're gonna be probably underneath if I feel sick underneath I can always slide the tent up a little bit by moving the casters but it'll fit under the tray oh my god [ __ ] quarter inch away that's okay I could fit it on the side of the town and secure it right here but either way I'll get that set up underneath there now to pump out the old nutrients so all right here's the thing with the Jumbos there's it's not always bigger roots of bigger fruits so crop steering you guys that are familiar with crop steering good if you aren't familiar with it basically all it is is the way that your environment is climate steering you can't cross steering without you can't crop steer without climate steering your environment dictates the demands on your plant and in the way that you feed and water your plant will help tell the plant what type of growth it should do there's vegetative growth and there's general growth generative growth is basically flowering or producing flowers and buds and mass right you can encourage either type of growth based on a your environment that puts the demands on the plant and then be your irrigation usually you want to lower ec smaller volume of feedings more frequently and then when you go into generative growth you want to have higher volume of feedings right so you're going to be feeding a higher shot size basically a bigger shot size you're gonna do it the same frequency almost a lot of people have the misunderstanding here's a golden Nucky this is like the biggest golden nugget I could give you about crop steering when you switch to flowering a lot of people think that you want to go from feeding frequently to infrequently so you would like cut out some feedings it's absolutely not the case you still want to see the exact same frequency because the plants only going to want to more so if anything you're going to add additional feedings right but you're going to stop feeding sooner right the same veg you feed up until the last hour right and then you turn off the lights I mean you turn off your feeding and the lights go off an hour later right that's bench in flower you're gonna want to turn off your irrigation like three to four hours and before your lights go off so that they have a larger dry back overnight right in between irrigation cycles I won't give you the magic numbers but you're only looking for a small dry back overnight you're looking for a larger dry back and flower that's what's going to tell the plant hey you need to be more like a generative growth and you're gonna give it larger volume feedings you know every feeding so it's gonna be like boom I'm gonna grow I'm gonna grow I'm gonna get water only at these feeding so I'm gonna take it in and I'm gonna grow you know that is that is crop steering so when it goes to these cubes they're going to allow for faster dry backs right which basically the plant is gonna it's gonna suck up more it's gonna consume more there's gonna be a constant spike in that EC going up and down as these irrigation events happen and the dry backs occur in between shots so that's going to encourage more of a generative growth and I'm actually probably going to cut down my veg time or by about a week to two weeks and the yield will still stay the same as so long as I still run the right plant count and the right lights you know this next round I'll be running from seed seeds are automatically more vigorous plus I'll be doing an undiluted herb natural soak and then prior to popping them so they're gonna be even more vigorous because of all the special [ __ ] herb natural right usually on average they say seed versus clone if you start a clone versus a seed you imagine the same amount of time and flour in the seed is going to be more vigorous in yield 15 to 20% more in the clone I've never verified that because I've never done a side-by-side but I can say for damn sure I believe it I'm grown clones versus seeds multiple times and seeds are way more vigorous their growth is funky and the word is still escaping me am i that spelling when things are equal side by side I'm a watching chat I don't know why I'm [ __ ] forgetting that my hair got long I have to adjust my hat oh [ __ ] ah anyways I've dropped enough golden nuggets for the night I'm stoned his [ __ ] my fear is done and I want another one so I'm gonna call it a night and I'll catch you guys on the next year", "Q7-RgJSvioM": "[Music] well guys welcome to CCC I'm Shannon coming through for a little solo concentrate review today I actually checking out some live resins from bear labs pretty sure bear actually used two BCE solutions so if you've been smoking oil in the in the California market for a couple of years you're probably familiar with Cee maybe wondering where they went they are now bear labs this particular flavor I've got my hands on here is called lemon meringue so I think we might have some some pipes in here go ahead and crack this baby open maybe the nose on this one is loud I'll definitely give it that super super citrusy definitely some skunk enos in there so lemon meringue if this is the lemon meringue that I think it is it's the exotic genetics lemon meringue which is cookies and cream and I want to say lemon skunk cookies and cream definitely a super fire cookie cut it's you know definitely one of the more finicky ones to grow not always a huge yield er but the buds that you get from it are really really nice I've always liked cookies and cream lemon skunk definitely one of my least favorite lemon Terp strains all the you know typical strains that have kind of that st. herb profile the [ __ ] tan geez and the clementines and the kaleo's and all that same old [ __ ] lemon skunk was one of the first ones I remember seeing with that turf profile but it's usually not quite as sweet as some of the other ones like the Clementine or the tangi and for that reason it's usually not one of my favorite Andy chirps but I do have to admit those that I'm getting off this one it's really really nice fire up the ship here and good [Music] oh definitely a fan of that flavor though I definitely got the the citrusy thing that I was expecting based on the smell but another layer in there almost like almost like a sweet kind of like a vanilla almost like a vanilla extract taste or something like it's kind of it's weird cuz it's just like a hint of that vanilla but it's like that very distinct and it's not like vanilla ice cream it's more of like a I don't know like I say like a cooking vanilla type type smell and flavor and taste I one was actually really interesting I'm probably gonna have to go back just to do another test to get a little bit more conclusive results on the flavor there so bear with me there one thing that's always kind of confused me about some of these citrusy strains is like the Clementine and you know all these other like orangie citrusy tasting strains there's a lot of people refer to that Terp isn't lemon like the lemon G is a good example it's called lemon tea to me it tastes nothing like lemon at all it's very like citrusy for me it's not the the more sour flavor it's more like the sweet just citrusy orangie I feel like a lot of these these uh like where they're calling this one lemon meringue I'm seeing a lot of these called lemon this and lemon that and maybe it's just my palate in the way I interpret it but all these lemon strains are very much orange to me like I said I actually really like the flavor that I got at that last one but it definitely didn't remind me of a lemon meringue pie that's one thing I do have to say about it maybe this one will a little more we'll find out [Music] [Music] oh say I definitely got the job done I don't know if you guys can see it on camera here but I'm [ __ ] sweating bullets I'm definitely feeling it right behind the eyes I'll get that you know forehead feeling's fuzzy type thing going on I like the flavor on this I like the buzz I like the smell I know like I said it's just hitting me so hard because those first two dabs of the day but I'm definitely feeling this stuff looking at the label who looks like it comes in at ninety three point one six total cannabinoids seventy eight point eight four percent THC zero percent CBD so definitely this stuff is gonna give you that nice nice heady high with these genetics I'm definitely expecting it to be you know definitely sativa leaning probably not too racy because you got the cookies in there to kind of mellow it out another thing about those lemon strains at least for me personally is they tend to be strands that I'll just smoke for the flavor because they don't really they don't really give me high there's there's none of that like indica body effect influence in there and for a sativa like if I'm gonna I'm more of an indica guy generally I used to smoke a lot more sativas but even then if I'm gonna smoke this Teva I want something that's gonna really get the gears turn it up here get me in that kind of creative introspective just you know sometimes I want to be all in my head for certain things and that's usually when I you know try to find a really good sativa the women's trains unfortunately just never quite get me there they just don't give you a tiny head change sometimes but they just don't get you over the hump I think they're good strands like I said for the flavor obviously it's hard to you know match the the potent flavor of some of these like lemon and citrusy strains but this one surprisingly actually got me pretty high that first day I took was mostly all rocks and just a little bit of Terps that last stab I took was way more terms and the Terps one was definitely a little bit you know harsher going down but I think by the time I exhaled that one I'm you know there was no doubt alright I'm high alright think that about wraps it up for this one thank you guys for watching another video here on the CCC go ahead real quick down there in the comments let me know what you guys are smoking on right now and let me know what kind of video you guys would like to see next whether I feel a way can make Wednesday strain review glass review bond-athon or if you guys have a new idea for a video go ahead and drop that down there in the comments give this video a like hit the bell and we'll see you guys on the next one I'm Shane for the CCC [Music] [Music]", "ai4YIZQKX3k": "what's up guys today we're doing a review on uh this is orange skittles from uh sticky frog this is a terp sugar live resin looks like we got 73.16 on total cannabinoids and 6.66 on terps that can't be good definitely smell some orange definitely some gas smells like orange gas um real crystally looking too real sparkly that stuff sparkle to it yeah it's pretty hard there's some uh flat pieces in here which is nice very orange too in color all right let's fire it up this is a cross between agent orange and was it agent orange and skittles orange skittles it's real dry it's not wet it's real dry all righty it's a real dry product like that i move the banger around like that it kind of hops around it doesn't really stay in the middle some of the other products like gems and juice or the cake icing it stays right where you put it me wow really nice flavor let me taste the orange mostly gas though this is a very chronic chronic flavor very tasty very smooth too very nice i'm actually kind of impressed usually when the products dry like that it can be a little bit harsher so very nice all cleaned up in the banger very nice nice product that was my first rip of the day too oh my heart racing a little bit so it's a hybrid it's probably a sativa leaning hybrid though cool eyes getting heavy yes sir all right loving it sunday morning dabs that was sticky frog orange skittles give it a 8 out of 10. nice product", "A0hZd1ueLtg": "hi my name is cue Pinson is Wednesday in Colorado Springs and Wednesday is important because it is one of the days we like to Rio now before I get started I want to say follow me on twitch TV slash coupons for more awesome live content now Wednesday it's one of the days of the week we get deals on concentrate Wednesday and Saturday are two of the bigger days wax Wednesday and Saturday as they call them not everybody has those deals but a lot of places to do so we always like to look on Wednesday and I always start in the comfort of my own home on weed naps calm want the best places to look they have plenty of deals they can look up everything in my area there's bounce deals there's grand bills there's plenty options there so we're gonna get a little bit of an idea of what's out there before we get started and hopefully we get some really bang stuff today we are in the car here headed to the ATM most dispensaries are cash businesses and it's a lot easier to tip and purchase things with cash oftentimes so we're headed to the ATM to pick up some cash and I'm looking here on my phone actually and signed up at a few dispensaries for their text message alerts and they'll text me with their daily or weekly deals or if they have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go check out the first one now but we're gonna see what we can get with $80 today now I've had some good luck in the past getting a low price grams but we're gonna see what today hold so if they don't have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here into our high five vape and we are ready to death alright we are finally back home we got the emails fired up and we're going to try a few of these out here what do you got there jam band you got that jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the pre-roll joint so I think was around 76 for everything not a bad price for today I hope you enjoyed hanging out with us today and please if you like the content go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel

community canvas reviews today i'm going to be reviewing a white label live resin cartridge um i had a bezel i think it was or bevel one of the two um bezel there we go i had a bezel distillate cartridge in and i just kind of got bored of it honestly because the terps are not very strong part of it being um they're not cannabis derived terpenes so live resin should spice that up um the live resin that i got is actually less terpy than the uh or it has less terpenes total we'll see what it tastes like anyways but less total terpenes than um uh cured resin surprisingly but either way we'll try it out it's wedding cake which is an indica this is cultivated by green queen farms and it comes in at 84.05 total cannabinoids um and 5.39 total terpenes um yeah so i'll read the terpenes and show you what it looks like but first let me flip the camera around for you [Music] uh [Music] all right let's try this out step one take off the sticker all right um first that's the thing about some good live reds and this um just some i don't know yeah some just good live resin cartridges i can smell that one no leakage whatsoever perfect seal that just smells nicely very sweet and almost like perfumey that's some interesting elements there so it's got a pretty basic um oh yeah that's it's got painting in there a bit smells kind of piney slash perfumey mostly but the leading terpenes and are the basic um are pretty standard beta cardio filling at two point zero four two percent uh limiting at one point five percent humiliate at zero point six percent um beta mir seen at 0.5 alpha pinene at 0.18 cedrine at 1.7 or 0.17 um alpha vista bologna at zero one point zero point one six and finch all at 0.127 so they always have a very detailed um terp list right there but usually a lot of the ones at the end are in pretty low amounts i don't think i can ever really taste them that already smells like it's gonna be way better than the other one was so um got two uh little silicone caps and the branding on this is c cell c240 620 but yeah proper c cell so that's always good um so first thing it's very very clear and light that happens with some white label um i think part of them being just like they they get stuff from different cultivators a whole lot just depends on who cultivated it what the starting material was like i think and white label actually as far as i know white label means like whenever there's um a producer doing white label extracts it means that they're doing extracts for other growers stuff instead of their own stuff so i think they've just made a name of that and that's just like their process but that's usually what that means so um i answered on reddit recently somebody posted a live resin cartridge by white label that was also very clear and wondering if it was real and also they had someone tell them that it was delta eight but they also said it looks like it has delta eight terpenes in it which if you know much about cannabinoids that's not even how that works so um but they came on reddit to verify it and i posted some cured resin and live resin that looked similar and that's just how white label is sometimes i don't know if it's crc i know they seriously well i don't know that but i'm pretty sure they crc some of their dabs so maybe they do their cards as well um i've never had a card that was remotely bad they always put out really good stuff and it's priced a little higher than some of the other stuff i get so i don't get it as often but part of that is it's higher quality too so i don't think they do it badly so all right so here's wedding cake yeah that smells it's just like a general sweet smell it's um i feel like there's like a very even smell of like the pinene and it's like limonene and something else that i don't know which i actually want to say is one of these terpenes in a lower amount and i definitely smell pining at 0.184 so i think i'm smelling one of these other ones either alpha cedric and alpha visceral or pinchol um i'm pretty sure finch all taste i've had finching which i assume is pretty similar just in this last buddies card i had and that was very like like so i don't think it's that probably i've had uh visible alone i think that's pretty sweet and i don't know about cedrine let's see about taste and smell okay upon hitting it you just get a very a much more pronounced and very standard like weed taste um i say that like it means a lot um a very just like nice balance between uh earthy and herbal and like um vaguely like musky taste to it uh not really musky someone says like the other two though um yeah it just tastes like weed usually does for most streams and don't stand out anyways uh that's how i remember wedding cake to be too i've had wedding cake from a couple different producers never a live resin so that's kind of cool but i've had select elites and that's just distillate with their terpenes and tasted pretty similar yeah so um it's not a a real standout strain to me um things like that are like mandarin cookies and like or tropicana cookies was a really good one or blueberry muffin um things like that usually stand out more to me than like wedding cake where sometimes you have strains that really do taste a little bit like what they're named and then you have stuff like wedding cake where i feel like there's maybe more behind the name or they just thought oh that's a good name for it or something like that um sounds pristine or primo or something like that very good very good but doesn't taste quite like wedding cake and the terpenes don't really stand out to me yeah those terps linger very nicely um very present unlike the non-cannabis drive terpenes that were in the last one that's why i switched it out though um i'll have the other one as a reserve in case i run out or can't get any more or something but wow this is nice and the effect on it very nice and full body too um a really good live rise and that's a good thing about the stream too is it um it's just well-rounded very well-rounded so sometimes something being well-rounded enough can make me be interested in it a little more if it doesn't stand out because sometimes that's what i'm looking for like right now for example and the perks of having a proper c cell at that vapor production all right so that's hitting pretty nice i'm getting some aftertaste again but i think it's some of those terpenes or maybe just all the mixing together but it's nothing really strong it's just so so much of like so little it's hard to describe but mostly just like um i'm getting some herbal tastes and some earthy taste like i said and i'm also getting like a weird i almost want to describe it as like how talcum powder smells that's a weird freaking thing but like it's like a very like reminds me of like a rocky taste or something i haven't tasted rocks so i don't know but that's what i imagine rocks to taste like i don't know if that's uh it's not a bad thing too it's very interesting i have to wonder what um alpha cedrine is like the effect is very nice and terps are just they stand out very nicely as they should with some live resin so yeah i think i'm starting to repeat myself a bit so i'm going to close it out here with some smoke rings at least one of those was a ring i'm pretty sure alright thanks for watching uh like and subscribe if you want and stay tuned and um yeah i'm a lot more interested in the cured resin this one's kind of a placeholder but the in the cured resin is a josh d strain which i've done a little bit of reading about because my name is josh as well so i thought that was interesting enough and he has some pretty good uh good-looking stuff and it's a josh d strain extracted by white label and it has more terpenes more cannabinoids more thc cbd um all of it really just seems like a better cartridge honestly it was cheaper i probably should have just got two cured resin cartridges um but yeah stay tuned for that one that'll come around in the next day or two so thanks for watching like and subscribe and stay tuned for more", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "PS1fdj6KWLk": "[Music] [Music] you holy [ __ ] [Music] holy [ __ ] oh my gosh hi guys welcome back to my channel you guys are having a great day don't forget to like comment and subscribe so i'm super excited because i just got this piece yes and this banger too i think it's so [ __ ] cool like i don't know it just looks so [ __ ] dope so we're going to be dabbing out of girl animals today it's a hybrid and to be honest i already took a hit before the video and that shit's mad so let's get straight to it again so y'all can see the function on this and the hit this is how the wax looks looks really nice the first hit that i took was very smooth and actually like had me turn up like i literally [ __ ] am i i'm all sweating already dude like i really am but i really like this piece because i can hold it like this and the bottom part is like just i don't know it's very sturdy for me because i'm i drop everything like i drop everything you know so this comes in very convenient for me and it's black because i'm always i feel like i'm always wearing black so it goes with me you know let's do this go ahead and grab your dab your blood your joint your king palm your edibles or if you're just here so i really like how it's saucy and but not too saucy to the point where like i have it on my um what is it called this dabbing my dabbing tool and it'll slide off it's just perfect let's go with this dab because it's getting hot um it's so like pure like so like what's that word not rough i always say it smooth so smooth on my throat i feel like i don't know i didn't feel harsh about you know sometimes when you're taking it down you're oh [ __ ] it feels harsh like nah this stab like definitely [ __ ] worth it off the first before i even started this video because like i said i took a dab before the video i was like this is i like this and my second dab like boom and it tastes like i don't know i feel like it's kind of like a lemony i always say lemony because it tastes like that to me like tiny lemony i don't know but definitely [ __ ] bomb i'm ready to go in for another dab but at the same time this is the only gram i have on me it's just you know a hassle by graham and graham graham i prefer a baller jar but hit me up for bomb plugs only if they have the ball of jars because i need me some i'm just going for another dab what do you guys prefer ooh what do you guys prefer do you guys prefer taking dabs joints um cartridges personally whenever i have dabs i like dabbing it because it's so quick um and it gets me right to it like you know it just hits me so much harder and it's quicker to get me high but let's say like forever type of [ __ ] i would definitely probably stick with like king palms or something but i love me some concentrate forever it's a little too hot so let's go ahead and wait all right let's go ahead and go in with this dab cheers so bear with the sound as well we just got a new mic and we're barely playing with it it is the very first day so sounds different or weird like it's because of that you know damn those are some bomb ass hits i really [ __ ] did like i'm pretty high i'm pretty high i can definitely take more dabs because it's just feels like so smooth and it tastes bomb but i'm trying to conserve it so yeah i'll probably take a dab later on or tomorrow but i hope you guys enjoyed this video i would definitely buy it again um rate it one through ten ten 10 for sure like 10. i don't know i [ __ ] with it i really [ __ ] with it go ahead and follow them on instagram at kelly kosher follow me too if you want to stay updated with me or whatever and until next time guys bye", "2Ivlp-aXToo": "how's it going everybody this is rick wayne today we got some purple punch live resin by ursa i'm still not sure if it's ursa or if it's ursa but either way they have some really good concentrates i tried one of their concentrates before and this right here is the purple punch so i decided to give it a shot this is the close-up just like live resin goes you know it's really nice and saucy i actually got a little bit on the top there which is you know a little bit disappointing but i'll get it off and um yeah this is pretty much just the standard the smell is just absolutely outstanding that's one plus i like about ursa they're pretty much hitting the ball point when it comes to the smells and the aromas i like that this right here is the scoop the consistency is really good um just like most live resin batters you can't go wrong you definitely can't go wrong with how well it heats up and how good of a dab you're gonna get out of it so this is the slowdown on the meltdown look at that perfect dab in there and it's melting oh man so i went ahead and got this semi i went ahead and gave it to my 100 and tasted every aspect of this concentrates i went ahead and waited a good half an hour to let everything kick in and see how i felt the taste of this is so amazing it definitely puts into perspective as to what a good live resin could be and how live renzo should be and most of the live residents that i choose out definitely have really good taste of the roblox that's one really good thing about the live resin and one good thing you should seek out if you have the opportunity to either taste or smell your live resin before you pick it up i thought long hard about this one i ended up giving it 8 out of 10. thank you so much for watching y'all please like this video if you like it subscribe peace", "VpIZwirwtEU": "[Music] what's up guys your boy p2 peeps today we're going to be checking out rogue river labs sour banana shriver and i'm just not going to say anything else besides from that from now let's go ahead just take our hit and then give her our normal spiel after so cheers everybody thank you for coming in and you know joining in on this video appreciate y'all hope you got a dab pack the bowl ready to go or you know your cart pen at the ready cheers boys [Music] oh you know we got to get a blinker going for that first hit that's just standard so anyway man this is pretty good so we're looking at the sour banana sherbert strain is a hybrid from rogue river labs and we've already seen you know a good amount of their carts and uh products and things like that here on this channel so you know this i'm not gonna say it's gonna be no different in a bad way but you know you you shouldn't expect anything different from rogue river labs if you're already uh you know a customer if you've already had it you know you're gonna know what to expect it's a smooth hit very good flavor actually you know what i'm saying um i forgot to mention that this is the cannabis derived terpenes version so this one has a personally to me a better flavor profile than the other ones that we've tried here on the channel which are not cannabis derived terpenes cartridges back to the taste portion we're getting kind of a tangy taste there it's not super pronounced but i will say that the the piney taste is definitely there you know the tang kind of there pine definitely there you know we're getting really piney taste here not really much of the gassy kind of diesel-y kind of taste there's anything like that uh sweetness very mild i wouldn't say it's too sweet no pepperiness i'm detecting at all or anything like that so you know that's kind of what you want from a strain that says sour banana sugar i'm assuming if you're you know grabbing a strain like this you're not much for the peppery terp the kind of more bitter terps and things like that so um yeah potency-wise though this isn't too bad i'd say that i think that uh the black lime og definitely hit me a little bit harder than this one did off first hit but we'll go ahead and take another one here i mean i have given this a go a few times every now and then but it's been a while since i i've actually uh tried or you know had a delta 8 thc sesh this is what one of the last delta 8 thc cartridges i have on deck i do have a little dropper to refill them with so that's just kind of what i'm waiting for to finish all of them out and then i'm going to refill them all and you know continue having my delta eight sessions so let's go ahead and take another hit guys so i can give you guys maybe a little bit more notes on that and see how it feels and things like that you know this is a hybrid strain so don't expect it to lean too far into one direction um i mean it could though you know this is this is a sherbert you know sherbert's kind of uh for me at least they kind of lean towards a more uh sativa like dominance but they still slump you out from the you know the indica so let's go ahead and take a hit y'all thank you for joining me once again and i hope you can join me on this woman positivity and good vibes always oh and before we take this hit please don't forget to hit that like button drop a little comment let me know what you smoking down below or what you plan on picking up this week if you're looking at anything that's going to be very exciting very new go ahead and let me know down there all right cheers everybody [Music] yeah that one so that blinker definitely got me i'm probably gonna be coughing for a little bit more excuse me nothing like the first session of the morning right boys always be like the first session in the morning your lungs are like a lot weaker you know what i'm saying like big rips just take me out on my first session of the day um you know obviously when i sash later on it's not as bad but yeah this one this one definitely hit me so now that we got a nice hit there to talk about that potency i'd say it's pretty up there i wouldn't say i'm enjoying it more than the uh the black lime one just because uh i think that highway is perfect for me you know that it was like an outright indica and that's just that's just what i prefer um this one i'm definitely getting a little bit of that uh head high feeling a little tingly in the eye so probably gonna be in that eye droop very soon um i'm not really certain whether i'm feeling more of a sativa or indica dominance here or anything like that you know if if you guys know more about this strain than i do then for sure let me know everything i kind of saw online though was a little disputed on where it leans so i guess it just depends on the phenotype you grab for it so my opinion on this cartridge very good just like all the other rogue river labs ones and um you know flavor wise i think this is a lot better than all the ones i've tried so i'm gonna need to get some more cannabis to have terpenes uh thc carts so thank you guys for watching all right well i know y'all can tell the camera freaking died but i'm still going to take another hit before we go guys this video just ain't over just yet but if you didn't stick around until here please don't forget to hit that like that comment that's so too hey that nerdy bill please please please you know if you're trying to stay in tune for all our uploads live streams things like that please that noti bell is going to do your work thanks everyone for joining in let's take one last blinker here for the video appreciate y'all for stopping by i

"nowadays in this world they come along I'm along and they'll make a rolling paper that looks like mine in fact it's some kind of a lot like mine not so bad but they make it in a third-world country like China and they sell it for less and now you're going underneath me so rather than a ladder going up we're going down and then most companies will respond to this this undercut by making a cheaper product I pull my production out of al-khoei and I start making it in China also and I come underneath you look I'll be even cheaper and then you go underneath me I'll cut back on materials to make it even cheaper and then I cut back on my materials and get even cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and we end up with a [ __ ] ass product you guys don't get to smoke and enjoy the way you should we end up with an ocean full of garbage that nobody wants and we never end up getting being able to fly through space at warp factor 9 because capitalism has been corrupted so I'm gonna teach it to you now in a way on the show to in a way that well I guess I'll show you the progression of one line of rolling papers I have to come around sorry I can't stay this from behind but let me show it to you so we have this raw one and a quarter which was the first size or all I ever made at the similar time we ride around then we also made raw king-size supreme interesting ly enough this was made on our oldest machine called the bicicleta 100 or 200 years old and it was used to be powered by bicycle now it's electric and it's a flat pack not even interleave the sheets themselves you have to take them out and fold them that's the oldest style so we have this kind of older packs we move on to things like rolls paper on a roll so now we're still progressing as you can see the evolutions still happening you make a paper you can tear this off make any size you want beautiful now we move on and we make connoisseurs come up with this invention a guy named Joker helped me with this it's papers and tips together with an elastic band to reminisce us of the ancient rolling papers our ancients are al-khoei and ancients who made papers tied with a rope and the original rolling papers which were tied with a string which I'm gonna get off on a tangent I keep going there so I'll stop but you get it you get the point then we move on and another friend of mine helps me make the art asano and together we all make this beautiful pack now we have papers tips and a built-in rolling tray detachable reusable you've seen my videos again this is evolution it progresses magnetic closer progression we then go back and improve the original connoisseur the original connoisseurs awesome but we make a connoisseur with pre-rolled tips again going forward evolution I have no competitor that's forcing me to do this so I just kind of compete with myself it's supposed to be someone else doing this by the way it's supposed to be them doing making the cool stuff and then I make something cooler but nobody does that really so we just do it ourselves alright so make we go on to this then we make the masterpiece box which is roles and pre-roll tips a sharp cutting edge and a magnetic closure so you have everything you need and I could keep going that I could but the point isn't it isn't about products isn't about making footlong rollin machines after making 70 millimeter rolling machines after making seventy nine millimeter land shoes after making hundred ten millimeter rolling machines after making seventy nine millimeter adjustable since 70 millimeter decibels and 110 millimeter holes and making them out of hemp plastic it's not about that I'm just want to share with you this mindset because my fear my concern is the more the capitalism gets corrupted the more that we do this thing of undercutting ourselves undercutting humanity and going down into the garbage the less that we really get to enjoy and the less we progress as I said before the world needs less hype men you don't need someone to come up and say yo man this is the best rolling paper because I said it's the best you better smoke it or else really we are grown [ __ ] men here we are adults with incredible brains our brains have more synapses than there are stars in the universe this is true you don't need someone telling you that instead what I think everybody needs is for an explanation knowledge why is it the best rolling paper ever my videos I think I have taught more about rolling papers to the world than anyone else who has ever come before me and I do this for a reason and I'm getting a little upset right now because I know that it will not be too long until I'm gone then all this knowledge and all this information and everything that poppy taught me will be gone unless I do these incredible videos and teach you about acacia gum and how it's turned into rolling paper gum and I teach you about how rolling papers are made and I teach you the art because it is an art of watermarking see a rolling paper when it when it's first coming out like there are the production it's just a flat piece of paper it's like a canvas but the art is painting on it is doing that watermark which I've shown you before is just done with heat and moisture but it's difficult and it's definitely an art rolling papers in itself is an art all of this is all right before I get any more emotional again I hope that I've been able to teach you more than most and my goal is to uplift you because the world needs more uplifting a negative you know not less negative sorry you don't need to hear about my problems or anyone else's problems at this moment especially as a smoker I think you need to be uplifted and that's what rolling papers in reality are really about their job is to uplift you and to give you an incredible experience and my job is to help you with that now before I end this there's what have I forgotten what else do I need to tell you guys I wish I could introduce you to Joe Kesselman you would have loved him he was a man among men I miss him all the time sorry alright so what else should I be talking about is in essence the blue of mankind it's a mindset and it's capitalism in its purest form and I'm going to teach you all of these products are about the evolution of smoking which is in essence the evolution of mankind it's a mindset and it's capitalism in its purest form that boy is nervous as hell doing seven-minute videos about us calling me a hype man talking about copying his whole style look man you're looking weird man you're looking weirder and weirder every day man cut the [ __ ] and what problem do you have with the Chinese or the Dominicans that's crazy to me you know you're definitely a piece of [ __ ] dawg for real you", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have

look come check this out holy [ __ ] what do we have over here we got the new norm now i've actually been looking for the new norm they're the highest percentage in thc that i've ever tried in any cartridge so but look guys check it out we got a couple different strains here too we have the bliss we have uplift sleep relaxed and calm and some of those trains right there the calm is a girl scout cookie we got god's gift on the relax right here these are this is a full gram too according to this package we have granddaddy purple granddaddy purple one of the original og strains out there man if you didn't try granddaddy purple man you ain't og enough you're too young man your new booty okay and then we have over here green crack and blue dream personally you guys for myself i'm a girl scout cookie and granddaddy kind of guy man i could all day every day you know what i'm saying um actually oh i think the bedtime is coming right now okay this is our new normal the highest of happiness the highest highest percentage is that like the highest percentage of thc yes exactly exactly you're great so they do source and they uh they source all top shelf so it's going to be all 90 and above they have different types of effect if you're looking for calm so it's good for anxiety um relief you just kind of want to relax we do have a blend that's good for relax if you do need something for sleeping if you suffer from insomnia or something along those lines you could do something with sleep or if you just want something you could take on you know a trip you do the uplift which is sativa dominant and bliss is a little in between just your preference they do test pretty high so it is a really nice high as well and you said they're all over 90 all over 90 and the battery has lifetime warranty by full gram you get the battery for a dollar wow that's what a lot of people get kind of mixed up on with the relax the calm and the sleep is most people think that they're the calm is like oh it's going to put me to sleep no it's just going to control your anxiety and your mood throughout the day relax is kind of in between almost the same as calm but it that's something you would smoke when you get home from work that would kind of unwind the sleep that's going to put you to sleep that's something you want to indicate exactly exactly i like the downers man and because these stuff but you don't want something that's gonna completely put you down right i want some of that too but you know what i'm saying okay all day yeah yeah yeah so maybe we can mix it up with like the calm okay the relax and the sleep um let me get five of the sleeves let me get five of the relax let me get five four grams of the kong okay so then we'd get five batteries and each at a dollar because every full gram you get you get a dollar battery which is in steel you know what i'm saying yeah i guess just to try it let me get two uplifts and one bliss like a kid in a candy shop today also i

going to find random people inside the store and we're just going to buy them [ __ ] very very consistent so what i like about chocolates they are fat soluble so they're going to stick to your fat which means it's going to be a higher absorption rate so it hits you a little bit harder and a little bit more consistent um so every time i eat the same amount of course your tolerance is going to go up yeah but it's almost the same you know how sometimes you'll eat gummies and you're like okay one day you get hit really hard the next day you're like what the heck then you eat more and then you eat a little bit too much yeah yeah yeah so that's that's going to be a little bit more consistent than that sick and they're really good too same with that let me try let me try a bag of these edibles is it different your edibles are like the ones you'll eat and there's two hours later when you're like these edibles ain't [ __ ] and you're freaking out on your bed sweating and [ __ ] like

happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "UT5jSg_xnyQ": "some diamonds CCA diamonds this is blue cookie last stuff I made this rocket fuel turned out caviar didn't make me big Christmas there's a whole bunch of small ones oh this makes big crystals", "jgz3vCyAzrI": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video and i picked up some papaya punch and let me get this out of the way i already tried this i ran out of wax and i wanted to open this and it was too dark to film like a like a you know the opening of it but i already tried it and it's honestly very good very much more enjoyable than the mars one and i enjoyed that one but this papaya punch one uh let me just uh zoom in or let me get a video of the packaging for you guys to show you what it's running at so uh but yeah we got the papaya punch right here live resin purchases for 28 out the door at authentic as you can see right here buy a punch even have a number to call because the qr code as well but you know with these that they come with a little field dab tool it's pretty nice uh i have like two of these now you see a little field just this way [Music] very good stuff sugary wax consistency all right now that we got that out of the way um good stuff i mean you saw from the picture the smell it kind of smells like purple punch but only a little bit and i'm guessing that that's maybe one of the crosses in this papaya punch let's get started let's take a [ __ ] here [Music] so he's packing the gobi my trusty gobi that i've been using the [ __ ] out of i mean you've been seeing it in the videos lately it's just been a dope device and uh what's cool about this is i've only charged this twice since i got it and i use this every [ __ ] day let me just tell you that i probably had it for like a month or so now and i've only charged it twice i believe the battery is 1500 milliamp per hour i could be wrong i think it might be uh no i don't think it's 900 i think it's 1500 that's a fat battery that's like a double of a phone battery you know so in a phone the screen takes so much battery you know what i'm saying so like this is just it turns on it heats up i mean it lasts pretty long [Music] life should be much easier but every hidden day that i harbor ain't no angels like me but i see them turning darker wet in the water life should be much easier but every day very enjoyable refreshing taste and you know i was i was taking hits from this yesterday night i was definitely stoned like i needed it before i started editing because yesterday i edited a 30-minute vlog and uh kind of needed some inspiration you know i'm saying and this definitely did the job uh papaya punch i'm gonna assume that it's a hybrid just like it's you know ancestor purple punch but i could be wrong don't quote me on it i will post the crosses right here post process but you know what i'm saying papaya punch is the wind in my book i wouldn't say i'm the biggest fan of purple punch but i love it or i like it i love it um and i enjoy it so like every now and then i'll purchase something punch because when you get something punched purple punch papaya punch [ __ ] skittles punch it's just that sweetness that you it's just a refreshing like satisfying hit you know i don't know how to explain it may sound dumb as [ __ ] but whatever cheers guys oh perfect way to start the morning and i'm saying i'm gonna take one more hit blow it towards the fan because you know that's what i usually do i like to see the smoke and as you can see this is awake and big this is actually the first

time that is solventless extracts that's right water-based extracts today i'm talking with my good buddy chris from solely solventless out of denver and man he's been really like pushing the bounds of uh um extraction water extraction rosin extraction in the colorado area so if you're around if you're around denver or come to denver definitely uh check it all out man hey guys and if you haven't joined already please join us at therealdirtpodcast.com subscribe on itunes and hey man check out our new youtube channel you know we're just working on it but uh should be all of our episodes loaded up there real soon and uh i believe that is the real dirt podcast on youtube so thanks again for joining us today and as always sit back and fire the largest joint you can and enjoy this episode of the real dirt and this is chip from the real dirt good morning hello one and all another episode of the real dirt podcast this is 2021 and today we're gonna talk about extracts concentrates how they're kind of made and what they are the first time i ever heard of a concentrate of course it was it was called hash and we didn't quite know what it was and this guy kevin price i believe he was he he was like hey i got some hash she you know and we looked at it and we were like man this looks like rabbit [ __ ] are you sure this is hash and to this day i'm pretty sure he sold me rabbit [ __ ] as hash and we didn't know any better so we smoked it but it's come a long ways and as soon as i got real extract which was jamaican hash oil back in way long time ago i realized the potential of extracting the trichome and extracting the molecule from cannabis and have really been fascinated with it since then in all its forms from traditional hand rolled hash to sheaved and pressed hash to bubble hash to sub critical co2 butane propane solventless like i'm really fascinated and interested in it all and today we have chris from solely solvent list chris a good friend of mine say hey chris how you guys doing out there thanks for having me chip you know chris is an unsung hero he has some of the finest extracts on the market they're boutique and rare to find and if you ever see them absolutely scoop them up they may be a little bit more expensive than the ones sitting next to it but you know what it is absolutely worth it hitting it chris i appreciate all those nice words there chip yeah man just paying attention to detail man and you know really having a love and appreciation for this plant and all that's all its power that it entails you know so you know we're small small batch but uh you know we're just starting out if you do happen to catch us on the show like chip is saying yeah man you definitely gotta give us a shot you won't be disappointed we like to take our time like i said that attention to detail is important when it comes to solving this extracts there's a few things you definitely have to uh pay attention to as far as the input or the material you're using to get that output that we all desire are what you know the customers are desiring these days one of the biggest things about xtract is the quality material in gets exceptional quality out and many people just use the trash you know to make it and and you can't absolutely do that but to me you guys can best gear possible you use the best buds possible that's right my friend yeah a lot of credit goes to the action you know the cultivators first the flower has to be top-notch the flower's banging and it's on point and usually you know the hash on the other end comes out what you would like as far as like you know quality numbers you know that can all vary from a few different things different genetics and yield different numbers in those areas you know it's it's all interesting it's all you know experimental it's just great to learn and you know every day you know whether it's something that really throws down a lot of hash you know and you know it's in the family of the gmos or the cakes or something like that or something that doesn't really throw down as much it's more you know on the terp side i mean that's all important you know it depends on what you're looking for what are you starting off the day with man you you you smoke weed in the minute at the beginning of the day are you one of those people i mean probably like three or four times at the beginning of the day three or four times at the beginning uh i mean what did i have this morning i had a little bit of the uh some some live rosin made by myself it was some uh i call it the gumbo mix or you know my term that's right because chris is from actually from louisiana yeah you're right you're right um he's also our resident go-to of anything southern cooking food as well he holds the gumbo and shrimp and grits title at cultivate colorado currently right nobody compared yeah i mean i i i take that pretty probably anybody wants to step up at all i'll take it you know but oh man when we made shrimp and when you made shrimp and grits down here in oak okc my crew here never had it and literally the other day they were like man that time you guys made shrimp and grits he actually said chip you made tripping crap right uh i didn't take credit i mean it was a team effort man come on we watched you do it extracting hash is just like cooking you can be a cook or you can be a chef right you got all the right ingredients you got all your temperatures together you prepare everything properly you prep everything properly then wow you got something then right yeah 100 yeah like uh you know a lot of people you know may not go along with the the mix material washes but i particularly like those because as you were saying with i like cooking and flavor profiles and things like that you know you take two different you know hatches and mix those together you never know what you're gonna get man like you can be in a mood this day take a hit of that you know the same hash you know that you hit two days ago and get different flavor profiles because you might be in a different mood or something you know it just really depends like today a mix of tropicana banana and monkey berries and i really like that that's my gumbo mix for this morning chocolate chip did pretty well those did about i think that was at four percent together so not bad numbers so you're mixing these you're mixing these flavors in the bag yes i like to actually mix material together and wash it together in the bag you can do it separate if you like and then mix the resin at the end and press it like that if you want you know that's a preference thing man everybody got their own way to do it yeah way i like to do it you know so it works out well for me i don't have any issues with it taste fire love the taste so we've been babbling a little bit here i realized like there's a lot of people that listen to these podcasts or we'll see this podcast that don't really understand what hash or extract or rosin or resin or solvent list or bubble or co2 or any of this stuff is man let's just let me get your opinion of it let's let's let's start at the beginning let's have like a 101 basic extract course from chris i would tell you this i honestly um you know definitely knowledgeable in the extracts but as far as an extract connoisseur or someone who is going to go to a store and buy an extract over flour that was not me three or four years ago i would say the hydrocarbon extractions or co2 whatever you want to call it those extractions you know just we're not really that interested in them as far as like dabbing them but definitely using them for edibles and things like that which they would come up really well in edibles so you know never really you know downplayed it or anything like that but starting just like let's let me let me pause you right there and ask you and let's make some ex explain to people what's going on so most of the extract you see on the shelf at a dispensary say in colorado or california it's some mostly some sort of wax or goo or oil or shatter and most of that is made with butane or protein propane some type of hydrocarbon mixture right right right right they're literally just combining all of the the plant material they're mixing it with the hydrocarbon and then they're separating out the plant material the hydrocarbon they're recollecting the solvent the hydrocarbon yep and what's left is the extract right right right right and that's what mostly is on the shelf so when you're when you have a pen what's what's in most pens chris you get a mix of a few things these days i've seen uh you know you get your distillate pins mixed with terps i would say uh you get your sauce pins i've seen you know lately you're starting to see some live rosin pins kind of new on the market but mostly mostly just through it and terps i would say which you know distillate would be you know just your pure thc no flavor profile and then able being able to take different tariff profiles and then add that to the distillate you know um it was some sort of solvent these those are all mostly solvent yes correct yes right right but but you mentioned rosin tell me what the difference is between solvent lists and and the the non-solvents oh well you know as you mentioned uh earlier with the uh actual process of collecting the trichomes using hydrocarbon uh with a non-solvent uh extraction or a solvent extraction as you want to call it you're actually going to be using water as the solvent or as the carrier or the lubricant whatever you want to call it but like super cold water so you want to use a combination of ice and water to actually collect those trichomes opposed to the hydrocarbon so a healthier way or a healthier method i would say as far as like uh approaching the extraction process but uh you know each process equally has benefits for whatever end product or whatever way you want to do with it but i just if you're asking me water and ice seems pretty safe and clean to me so using that path to actually strike trichomes uh you know solving this just you know really stuck with me when that started coming around i think nicotine probably is the guy to give respect to that starting that term from what i understand you know and he's been around for a minute pushing out some great product just learning and discovering that really got me really interested in that and these days you're starting to see it they're starting to be rising carter just popping up you know rising and batter live jam you know uh sauce and diamonds even like people starting to even make diamonds and solvents which is crazy because that's like mechanical separation and things like that it costs more for a reason though you have to put more raw material you have to take more care in the solventless extract than just a hydrocarbon extract the material 100 matters you can do it from trim and things like that well taken care of trim will deal some great results but decide it'll actually use you know your prized buds you know and something that a cultivator or you know cultivar that does really well you know you're gonna you gotta wash it you gotta collect it run it through the bags you know then take it from the bags goes to the freeze dryer you know that's in there for 24 hours comes out of the freeze dryer then you have to see that then you have to you know collect it again into your screen bags and then now you have to press it so you know you press it then you collect it and then now it has to cure whether you want to you know heat cure it cold care room temp cure whatever it may be there's all these different ways you can approach it there's no wrong or right way in my opinion it's all great technique yeah it's all technique and preference you know some people swear by full spectrum you know or like some people swear that oh it's got to be the 9120 or only 90 you know and that's like man that's cool you know that's great that's your preference you can like that but like you know it's it's it's all out there man it's everybody likes something a little bit different and it's great that you have the options with verizon you can do that also when you you use different material you get different results and it's really hard on the commercial market to have the same exact material over and over and over and over again and and so that's the importance of like what we're talking about you got to watch it see what's going on because what might collect what even one strain grown by one guy might collect differently than the same strain grown by someone else right and you you've you've seen this over and over again like wow man those crystals are really small those crystals are really fat like this is nothing but glands this is nothing but stocks you know yeah man i've seen two two different growers two same exact stream like almost one and a half percent difference you know which is crazy you know like that's a decent amount of difference you know but still great outcomes on that on that particular stream but uh yeah you're right uh environment that's actually grown in um you know maybe i'm starting to notice has a play in into that too and maybe appearance of the actual riser you know whether it's going to be a little bit lighter things like that whether those whether that person maybe pulled that product a little bit early harvested a little bit early things like that and you know kind of go into it too you kind of never really know so like having a good relationship with your suppliers where you're getting your material from really helps you know and like consistently consistently knowing that you know you're dealing with these guys it's going to be this every time you know you know that it's going to put out you know these guys grow it perfectly and boom you know everyone does good yeah well it takes a different mentality well slightly different mentality to grow for for high quality extracts i mean many people grow for extract but they're just literally trying to grow biomass they're just trying to grow like weight man the highest quality stuff though it comes from when you really take care just like you would ganja right all the way to the end and you finish it the same way and you know you dry it and store it and package it all the same way like you know maybe i mean you don't have to trim it necessarily right but like you definitely have to like you know there's a little bit of processing going on yeah you definitely like to prep it i mean you know you know you don't want to put any you know leaves that doesn't have any any sugar in there you definitely don't want that sure in there you know so you got to prep it a little bit but definitely as far as like taking care of it and growing it with the utmost attention attention to detail you know as far as like i know you don't have to do your ipm's but you have to minimize those things like that you know that really like carries over into your end product you know later in your flower cycle when you come up with an issue you know that's love matters you know so you got to be on it from the beginning man and take care of the growing environment you know many people are familiar with with this term bubble hash or water hash but let's talk about why what this solvent list how it's different from from just like a crude extract with water yeah so with bubble hash you know in the cycle route to get rosin you pretty much get bubble hash first but like you said most people are used to seeing you know the bubble hatch in the form of you know looks like sand i guess almost keith rather people familiar with the grinders you know and you have to keep catchers but like typically you know whenever you're washing the material and collecting it in the bubble bags you know before the whole freeze dryer thing at this point you take it out of the bubble bags you gotta pretty much dry it at the perfect condition to get it to not mold or anything to be able to go from like you know you know the bubble hash process like that that we're all use that's a pretty intricate process too to get that right to get that correct for freeze dryers like i mean i guarantee you i would have failed plenty of times you know what i'm saying i mean i i mean i maybe tried it a few times when i first moved here from louisiana trying to do some bubble hatch before rosin was even a thing you know and you know it came out well but that whole drawing process is tricky and lucky out here it's dry the standardized you know so it was pretty you know relatively easy to learning curve is you know easy out here with that lack of humidity but i don't know if that would happen in louisiana i end up with some moldy hash man you know a few times i'm sure yeah yeah you got to control your dry environment yeah but you know now but now with with free drives it's a different story yes free drive is definitely a different story pull it out of the bag wet press it out water out a little bit put it in the freeze dryer yeah right yeah and even with you know i mean still with freezer i mean you know you're using freeze dryers i mean people don't tell me you could press it in horizon a lot of people keep it as melt too you know you you know you separate use your bags and use that 90 bag get some full melt people really love that nice full melt these days it seems like you know different strains are going to give you different meltability of the heads but like usually that that 90 through 119 seems to be that that one that people love for that good bubble hash melt you know super clean heads you know barely any specs of anything you know but you know it's got to be clean that's got to be taken care of properly to get to that point you know and using the freezer man just freeze-dried bubble like can be incredible oh yeah right a few times i've had it it's been ridiculously good right but it's to get that high quality dabbable bubble at that point like it's really really strain specific that you hardly get any yield you know out of your your your batch when you do it that way right compared to kind of like what you're doing and you're making you're extracting as much quality material out of the the leaf as you can with water you're taking it freeze drying it right and then what happens well from that point once it comes from the freeze dryer we take it and we put it between these nice plates by these low temp plates i like to use those plates but they're great heated plates low temp heat and pressure um the bubble hatch goes into filter bag and then between the two plates and that presses out the rosin so you go from the bubble hash and then those two plates creates almost like a you know like an environment of where pretty much that that protective layer on the resin heads or you know that the bubble hash bursts from the heat and the pressure and it oozes out all that good oil rosin and you collect it into the jar or into your banger or whatever i've seen people do some crazy stuff on instagram but so basically it goes to a jar we're using water yeah and then we're freeze-drying it and then we're using a press with some heat on it that's right right and this is this is all just water and heat right natural man that's it water heat a little bit of pressure you know and boom you got some rosin you have some beautiful extract that you can then take from that state and cure it how you'd like or you can keep it in a fresh press state you know take it into cartridges take it into edibles which oh man make some beautiful edibles tastes so good i love that that you know some people complain about that weed taste or whatever i like a nice rosin taste and an edible in my opinion that tastes good me too yeah i prefer all the edibles with more basic extracts uh keef water rosin oh yeah right i i prefer those as extracts for sure hey all of you uh uh edible companies out there man don't just use distillate make some with keef make some with rosie yeah your clientele will love it too i'm sure they'll start learning you know when to experiment with different inputs is you know the education of all this stuff will definitely keep growing with more states becoming legal here you know as we keep seeing it almost weekly and it seems like i see another state is passing some you know medical cannabis or recreational loss which is great man so you know hawaii yesterday alabama tennessee like people in texas new york new jersey like it's going everywhere right it's happening man it's happening and that's great you know and you know that people people are going to want they're going to want to learn about it you know that's how it is man you know the thing about private market cannabis and that industry is is we always try to squeeze as many dollars as many cents out of a square foot or out of a plant as possible because you know it was gray market or it was totally illegal and and now that we have these legal markets it allows to us to do research and experiment with with cannabis on a different scale and you know even though like solventless you know might be twice as much on the shelf it might be 65 80 a gram on the shelf you know the the the manufacturer still is he's not really like making a ton of money at that price it's literally you know he's making less money that way than he would if he was doing butane or propane or co2 right he's making less money that way than he would if he was actually probably selling the buds for flour too right like it it really gives is solventless extract it really defines to some degree a different segment of cannabis production right because it's not just like this like the biggest bang for the buck right get the most money out of the square foot it's like hey i want to make this product and this is how we make it and then the market bears the price 200 100 yeah it's definitely a it's a it's a special product that like you're saying it's there's multiple steps to it man you know so so complex i mean it should be worth 120 a gram i mean i was just out in california and that's what it was about yeah it's 120 a gram there though because all the taxes that go on yeah and that's and that's what i was yeah it was attacked right right but yeah it's uh i don't like to say it's not for everybody but like you know if you want to get into it man it's definitely something that like it takes a little bit of you know diving into you know there's a few steps to it a few things that you definitely gotta you know you gotta pay attention to detail that's what this is man you know it's more like a food or a laboratory-like environment all right not to say not i mean that's what you know other extraction techniques as well not to say that's not how you would treat it with that one but like you know just particularly with the solvents man like like you said you grow all your flour you could take this flour and sell it as flour or you would take it and you know throw it in this water with this ice swishing around and hopefully some trichomes come out i mean you know that sounds crazy yeah crazy it does you know the research and you know the groundwork that a lot of people have done you know in the past few years i would say have definitely like built that confidence and i would say you know definitely curious minds like me for sure because it was definitely tough for me to dive into it too i remember thinking about this more than a few years back i'm like man that's crazy just take the flower and throw it in there and like like really okay but now you learn and you get educated and you're like okay now it makes sense you know now okay cool i'm definitely gonna go take my flower and throw it in there and do that you know because this browsing thing just tastes really good makes my edibles taste really good too so sorry i just had to break for a second you guys over at the uh i just do yeah right yes yeah i know you gotta have security up in the studio man all kinds of [ __ ] roll up here i mean tupac learned it the most i know dude that's right that's right i just was watching a couple episodes on hip hop evolution about that sad story man sad story sad story sad story yeah you know greatness often is is snuffed out too early man that that's you know i lost a couple friends this year uh danny smallwood and rob cox and man like you know it's always sad when uh flame goes out too quick man yeah that's right yeah man my condolences i'm sorry to hear that man hey both those guys danny and rob loved extract love bubble rob love bubble i was making it with both of those guys in literally 2002 and nice we we got super high you know on more than one occasion on a a handmade bubble that we just made with literally pantyhose and silk screen and man you're taking it back man you're taking it back [Laughter] right but it can it you know you don't have to have all the equipment you can do it at home you can do simple extractions at home and people should try if you're a home grower definitely try to do that go to the store go to the dispensary buy some see what theirs is like and then try to mimic it right yeah 100 there's a lot of information out there on the web these days uh you can follow an array of guys on instagram too um that are really interested it seems like in letting people know how to do this i gather a lot of information just from perusing instagram man following people that i look up to that i know we're doing big things out here in the industry and you know if you're familiar with colorado's or rosin scene you know who i'm talking about but you can find some information out there don't be scared of it man you can get the equipment relatively easy and it's relatively easy to use and you know learning curve with anything i mean don't expect you know just get it and then all of a sudden you know you got what you but it takes a little bit but you curiosity man you got to want to do it you know you got to be about it that's all i'm going to say you know like yeah you know if like if you like extractions and you like smoking extractions and you have access to flour and you know you have opportunity to do it you're in a state that allows you to do it i say do it absolutely i believe that state can be a state of well-being 100 so uh yeah get out there grow some weed man make some extract of it roll some joints with it yeah pass it along to your friends and your family and then grow some more do it yeah keep it going man keep it down great chat with you man likewise man i really appreciate you having me it's uh you know really an honor being on this show and i you know sharing the information that i possess here which you know take it for what you want but uh yeah man you know what i love about you man is next year

episode i want to sit back and uh vape up some some good solventless extractor maybe even go back and get myself some bubble hash and sprinkle some on a nice large joint you know i think i might have ruined myself that extract years ago by making uh trainwreck keefe joints and and train wreck bubble hash joints i probably lost a couple years smoking dust and i hope you guys learned a lot about extracts and solventless extracts today you know they're they're they're not dangerous they're safe it's just water um not that like hydrocarbon products are dangerous either but but many people have
