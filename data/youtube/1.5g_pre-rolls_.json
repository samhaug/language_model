{"g-oxZUhd8lc": "[Music] [Music] hello youtube this is 420 budmeister in this episode we're going to be doing got these from alberta cannabis site it goes for eight dollars and 49 cents you get uh three ultimate 0.5 of a gram so half a gram pre-rolls inside here equivalent to wall that's pretty freaking obvious equal to 1.5 grams of dried cannabis it's a 13 to 18 percent thc cbd i don't really care about that it's zero to one percent what they have to say about this is a premium flower pre-rolls made with our handcrafted ultimate oh this is different it's a 50 50 anticata sativa ultimate is a newly ultimate is a relatively new i can't pronounce that cultivar having been introduced to the market in 2009 this looks like this just okay introduced in 2009 the genetics have been kept a closely guarded secret by the original breeders so they don't want this stuff getting out it's a sweet and spicy taste with an earthy citrus aroma ultimate has rich dark forest green buds to stand out environmentally against an all green background of foliage so this is made actually down in uh cow town down in calgary that's where this stuff's coming from yeah so they described it as a pine woody hoppy sort of flavor and this stuff is supposed to be what's showing down here 21.9 so but it says 13-18 so let's try this out is by the company boaz b-o-a-z looks like you just pop it open inside here you're gonna get like three little bats those are half gram joints so let's try it out hmm it actually tastes decent not too bad yeah it's just you just go on the alberta cannabis site just look under pre-rolls pre-rose ultimates well so it's considered a hybrid that's why it's sativa so i usually don't buy many pre-rolls anymore but i just thought that i haven't tried this flavor before so pretty good i can almost kind of feel a bit of a buzz come on but in the last video i did drink some of this thc uh put in water so i don't know but i'm getting a really good buzz right now so best

show you guys something real quick all right my dude justin from the calm leaf hit me up says smoke doc i want you to try one of these i said sure why not bro and he sent me over a delta eight pre-roll okay and this delta eight pre-roll is coming from farmer barn those are the people that uh manufacture these um uh the name of this one is plowed pre-rolled joints and the manufacturer again is farmer barn okay but you can get these on the calm leaf site guys all right and y'all already know i'm gonna hook y'all up all right all the info be below pinned first comment let's open this up this has a good taste to it too okay so i just got one question is this the new norm serious is this the new norm i don't know my people i don't know but what i'm gonna tell you is that i am gonna try this and let you guys know if it's any good if i like it i'm gonna tell you guys to go get you some and if i don't i'ma tell them to try again all right how about that so let's light this bad boy up get some in the lungs so we know what it's about this is my first d8 pre-roll okay so here we go guys we're gonna light this up [Music] i can tell you one thing from the first poll it doesn't taste any different than your average pre-roll so there's no harshness there's no taste there's no trace of the delta eight so you would actually think that you're smoking a regular pre-roll [Music] i like it i'm just waiting for my first effects to come in so i can let you guys know what this is about see y'all guys can see that there's extra smoke burning off because most of the time i'm not sure how they spray the delta eight onto it but if you ask me i believe it's somewhat like a moon rock but with the delta eight keef instead genius right guys genius i don't think it's possible oh yeah whoa that was a good one like i was saying i don't think it's possible to grow delta eight flower you have to create it but what i'm doing now is trying to find out the companies that's doing the best job at that and i gotta honestly say this pre-roll is delicious it's smoking good and yes i got that fix got the effects already so i guess the more i smoke the more you know what i'm gonna get y'all guys go check this out all right i'm signing out right now but i will be back with another review soon guys i just wanted to show you some of the new products coming from the calm leaf guys all right so

reviewing kirvana's delta eight uh pre-rolls um this one is birthday cake flavored uh there is two joints in here um and there's three grams total of flour um it looks like they're keef covered as well um let's go ahead and get right into this um these are already open but it is the joints i i just uh i just tried to film this part and i totally forgot to hit record so let's go ahead and oh man it definitely has a cakey smell to it like i can i can 100 see where that that uh that name comes from which has been very super prevalent with them okay so the joints are stuck together all right there we go let's go ahead and which one were you smoking um well let's get a good little decent yeah these look nice i think i'm going to smoke i'll save this one yeah throw that back up in there it seems like they've got the keef really nicely laid on here too it's not very it's not really coming off super easy that happens a lot in a lot of the pre-rolls that i get that have keef on them all right well go ahead and grab whatever you guys are smoking on at home i don't care if it's a blunt joint bong bowl you guys know the drill cheers i've been super messing with this delta eight y'all sorry i know this is like four reviews in a row of delta eight stuff and like just videos about delta eight um i don't know if you guys have been really have been enjoying that content or not but 100 let me know down in the comments below um as well as drop a like on this video if you guys are liking these videos just so i you know know if i should keep uh pursuing reviewing the delta 8 stuff um i know it's like super new and everybody everybody wants to well it's not super new but it's super new to a lot of people and uh everybody just kind of wants to know what's up with it and and know what's good and what's bad so i've just kind of been trying to just get it and see my see for myself and let you guys know because i know there's a lot of you especially after seeing like the what is what it is and that it's good everybody wants i mean everybody's going to want to try it you know again and it's fire it's super fire i highly suggest it i've been messing with it super hard um i that cart it lasted me like four or five days and um i'm i smoke i i was smoking on it pretty consistently and i didn't really have a moment where i was like man i wish i had weed instead you didn't this is by the same company that i uh ate the edibles from by the way um and honestly this isn't even one of my sponsored videos this is just i i did this because i wanted to i mean i did the other ones because i wanted to as well but i did i 100 went out of my way to do this because i i enjoy it i really do and i saw the two pack of cones by kirvana and i was like those edibles smacked i gotta see what's up with that this ran me twenty dollars by the way which is not bad at all for two one and a half gram joints um compared to the flying monkey which was thirteen dollars um for a gram cbd with 200 milligrams of the see the delta 8 distillate on it as well as cbd keith that one ran me 13 and the edibles ran me 11 and then i had that cherry diesel cone which i got for five five dollars but i mean that's this is with the keef and everything and it's a one and a half gram and not just one gram so you're getting three grams of it plus their keef uh they're rolled in keef which that's a huge plus let's be honest here oh the flavor and everything is just so good it's so good this doesn't mean that your boy is just gonna start smoking this instead of weed not at all but i have been enjoying the difference of it i have been enjoying because i mean i've been smoking weed for a while you know and i don't know new stuff when it comes to weed is just fun oh that was a good ass ghost this is i'm gonna have to say we're only about a halfway through i don't know how much i'm messing with this though i don't know if i'm messing it with it more than the flying monkey but then again i also i don't know but it also keeps doing this i didn't break it i promise i didn't break this it just it started hitting it and now it's just wobbly and i've tried to tap it down a couple times and i tried to ignore it but i just can't man look at this i take everything i said back i am enjoying this more than the flying monkey but only a little bit only a little bit i can't say it's i i can say it's like a little bit better but i can't say that it's like astronomically better but for but for the price point it is more worth it 100 percent the only thing i just wish that wasn't going on was this it would easily be better if i just didn't have this going on honestly but this is probably not every cone so we can probably safely assume it's better it definitely is you know what i've noticed too smoking on this delta eight i haven't been coughing that much except for on the cart though that destroyed me that destroyed the [ __ ] out of me but if this was like a cone of normal weed i'd be coughing up a lung y'all already know we have a whole inside joke lung bust it like because i bust a lung on every episode like so i have personally as far as my own smoking goes i've been enjoying it more dude i'm high as [ __ ] look at my eyes anyways [ __ ] as far as my own smoking goes i've been enjoying it more because well i i hate coughing all the time i have asthma so you know i mean it it's just not pleasant it really just it's not but for the sake of comedic value for the videos i guess i'm probably losing points there thank you guys so much for watching this video if you haven't

to give them a huge shout out right because they're people there are just so and also so friendly customer service times 10 they walked us through all of their products and I told them kind of like what we were looking for she gave me a really awesome breakdown of basically all of their products especially after I told her that you were doing educational research she let me take a couple pictures so you're gonna see that up on the Block soon right yeah this is their logo Colorado but yeah this video is going to be all about caviar pre-rolls it is a hybrid this one specifically I love the packaging it's a hybrid and let's see what it says here show you a little bit more detail so flour and hash so like I said it comes in this packaging you squeeze on the side it opens up like that and what I really like about this pre-roll not only is the packaging pretty nice but check this out so pre-roll I mean it's pretty rolled for you but look at this like smoking tip it's like so what sexy as you can see that there you go it has the caviar logo it's made out of glass super easy to pull from the paper is basically the raw rolling paper and my personal favorite um and yeah so we decided to go with the hybrid and it's funny actually the way that that happened it's because they had one that was the team that had three so they had a hybrid they had a sativa and an indica so she basically looked at us and was like well I know you like sativa and then you like indica so then we looked at each other like oh [ __ ] which one are we gonna get right so she's like how about you meet in the middle and compromise so we got a hybrid so we're gonna go some off this bad boy we're gonna do the stat test on it so you'll see that on the blog as well and we'll keep you posted",

watch the show often you know i typically roll but i'm feeling lazy tonight so i'm gonna pack a cone friends tell me [Music] how you guys doing tonight it's gp here from cbd hemp library um if you watched the show before then you recognize me if you haven't welcome to the show welcome to your first episode it's kind of crazy to think for me to think that this could be somebody's first episode really just because we've made 300 not even because we're so big or anything because we're not that big but it's just wild for some of the first video to be the 300th video but let me get into said video what are we talking about today i guess today i'll talk about the downsides of delta eight thc sorry i'm about to start packing this and then i'll get to talking all right so the downside to delta eight thc well for me i would say the downsides depend on the product so for the first product i will talk about i will talk about edibles which we do have on sale right now one bottle left but with the edibles the biggest downside to me in all honesty which is something you'll deal with with all thc so this is i'm probably gonna get some comments below like that's if you deal with anything but the cottonmouth associated with delta h thc edibles seems to be more intense than other edibles and other forms of thc that i've had whether it's smoking delta eight whether it's a delta eight tinctures whether it's normal delta nine the cottonmouth associated with delta h thc just always seems to be extreme like sergio says it as well when the edibles the a big way you can tell they're starting to hit in my opinion is that cottonmouth really starts to starts to settle in so if this is something that you deal with please comment below um i don't want people to think i'm crazy and i'm sure you don't think i'm crazy because it is a normal a normal marijuana issue if you will but at the same time in my experience or in my opinion how much cotton mouth you get for how much you eat for delta eight edibles it's intense really don't need much more than that see i only have it like a little over halfway so typically i just burn off the top if i don't want to pack the whole thing sometimes i don't want to pack the whole thing i'll be sitting here talking to you guys forever if i smoke that whole thing and i know y'all don't want that [Music] i am packing some rocket fuel inside this cone today and we do have it on sale as well because square is [ __ ] with us but the next the next downside i would say about delta 8 t8c is with the carts and we haven't gotten a lot of complaints with our carts but many of the carts many of the disposables they leak in the normal delta 9 they leak as well but for some reason or maybe with some distillates um the delta 8 just seems to be so runny like if we get some delta eight dabs and we leave them out at like room temperature a lot of times they get runny they get liquidy everything gets sticky which is another downside when it's running and gets sticky and they get nasty if you have a disposable and it gets on the top then you put in your pocket now you have lint hanging off the top of your disposable and it's just not an ideal situation so the viscosity of um delta eight thc um the the distillate is another downside i would say a lot of times it gets really messy if you're dealing with the dabs if you're dealing with the dabs i would really suggest freeze them um and that's something you could say for dogs 9 as well but often delta 9 you can still leave them at room temperature and they're okay many times the delta eight dabs are not okay at room temperature any of you guys that smoke delta dabs watch out for that and for the carts make sure you vape them at the right temperature and not all of them are the same but in general i've seen the 2.5 to kind of uh i would say even up to 3.5 depending on what type of terps are in there um for them oh [ __ ] i forgot to head back but that's what i would really suggest is to just find the right temperature when it comes to the vapes or else if it's at too low of a temperature then it pulls it not already vaporized and so now you have even extra oil pulling up with a already liquidy substance so guys when it comes to distillate one be careful in terms of putting your hands on and stuff like that because because it comes because it becomes really sticky but also just make sure that you also freeze the dabs when you get them and make sure that the temperature is right when you set the pin which i would say i'd say 2.5 more than like like 2.7 to 3.5 somewhere in there um to make sure that it's not too harsh but also make sure that you're vaporizing the distillate before it kind of goes up the up the cylinder so that's a tip for you guys but that's also kind of a downside with delta eight is the viscosity or the lack of viscosity i didn't do too well in science but i know viscosity is the resistance of things to flow so that would mean since it doesn't have a lot of resistance to it flow it would have a low viscosity right please comment below if i'm correct i may be smoking but i will just some school another downside about delta hthc next i'll talk about the flour so when it comes to the flour um the distillate is infused with cbd flour that's what delta 8 flour is so now more things are at play so the cbd flour has to first off be quality cbd flour the distillate has to be quality distillate and it has to be infused correctly to where there's oil throughout the bud because a lot of times they'll just spray it'll be a light coat on the outside but all that dense cbd flower on the inside has no delta eight therefore you're getting uneven smoke it's sprayed unevenly it's just not a good situation so um that's another downside to delta thc and it's not saying that's all budged you have to be careful you have to make sure the company is using good cbd flour is using good distillate and is infused throughout and these are questions you could ask like if you ask us i can tell you that our rocket fuel is infused throughout and it is the top shelf on cbd buds but that's something that you should ask these companies before you buy it just in my opinion because that's what we've seen and we're in the industry obviously trying as many things as anybody i'm told i can tell you that some of the cbd flour it's harsh because the cbd flour isn't good and also um some of the distillate that we also smoke is pretty low quality on top of the fact that sometimes the buds aren't infused well with the distillate which doesn't make for as pleasant of a smoking experience considering that we do have dota 8 products available i am definitely not making this video um to scare anyone off from using delta 8 thc but at the same time i think that informed customers are always good customers so i just wanted to kind of let you guys know and and kind of just share some light on the delta thc market what to watch out for what some things are good to buy and what some things aren't good to buy and obviously we have tons of videos explaining these things but just some things to watch out for like having good quality flour like be careful of the disposables you get because sometimes they get runny so be careful about keeping your pocket keeping them and things like that i have had oil run out of the pen onto something i was wearing or something like that so definitely be careful with that and when it comes to first i talked about the edibles and when it comes to the edibles um keep a drink close by because that cotton mouth gets real it gets real sorry if i've been talking kind of fast i try to make sure i get all the information in my normal style is to more just lay back chill out just make a video but i want to make sure that i don't stretch the video out too long so people can get all the information possible i know people's attention spans are very very short so guys these are just some things i wanted to share with you i'm not trying to convince you to buy delta 8 or not to buy delta 8 is definitely a very viable option it's a product that i personally enjoy but cbd hemp library we were created to kind of warn you guys about what products you should buy and what products you shouldn't buy um and that's kind of just what i'm trying to give you a general guideline for so when you're looking for quality products last time i talked about terpenes today i'm talking about just what is quality and what is not quality and if you don't have a quality product some of the reasons i name today may be the reason why obviously cotton mouth is something that can't be helped you're just gonna have to keep some water close but these are some things i wanted to point out to you guys um so guys i definitely appreciate you hanging out with me i talked about delta thc talked about the flower talks about the vapes talked about the edibles if you guys have any questions about delta hthc please feel free to reach out to us dm us email us we can get you answers we can tell you about the products we tell you about our products here about other companies products we've tried so many so guys i really appreciate it like i said it's been gp another episode cbd hemp library legally lifted you name it we're putting content on it appreciate it guys [Music] peace [Music] you", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in

all right i'm gonna be trying something new and i'm gonna be filming the entire thing with you guys all right so pretty much though how this went down was i want to really take a break from d9 um thc and just because i feel like every single time that i smoke i don't really get the like super super baked just because of my tolerance right i've been smoking for four to five years already and i just feel like dude that's a long time man literally oh like i think for the past like two years maybe it's been daily usage so i haven't really had a break from it at all but today guys we're going to be trying out delta 8 thc all right so this one in particular is from a brand called moonwalker and honestly they're probably the leading industry delta eight company out right now that i've seen i've searched all over the google already uh i've had friends tell me that they use this product and they like it's probably the most talked about brand right so if it's being talked about it obviously has to be good so i went ahead and copped some myself i have two of the gummies right here i have the your let me go ahead i'm gonna butcher the hell out of these names europa and atlas this one right here i'm assuming maybe like an indica doesn't particularly say that it's indica but whatever and this one right here is atlas which is watermelons gitls and i didn't even read that they have strains but this one is blue dream berry alright so honestly two pretty pretty fire flavors so i'm gonna be taking like some of these i honestly don't even know so there's 25 pieces in each and each piece is 25 milligrams all right so i'm probably gonna take maybe i want to say i kind of want to take like 100 to start off since this is something that i really don't consume often i heard that this hits you way different than delta 9 thc since your body doesn't have a tolerance to it so i'm hoping that i can feel the effects but i'm pretty sure that i'm not going to be able to feel them right away so i'm going to come back to the camera in about like 45 minutes to an hour when i feel a difference 100 honest review if i really feel something different if my anxiety's gone away my stress like you know my headache whatever the case is but we'll tell you guys if we feel different but i don't want to leave you guys empty-handed for this first clip so we got something else for you guys we got two of their cartridges right here so this one on my left is calypso and the one on the right is titan right strawberry gelato sour lemon haze and then um yeah 800 milligrams so i'm gonna go ahead and bust into the strawberry gelato for the first one and see if i could even take feel anything i'm not gonna i don't want to go two two i don't want to get too too faded or whatever the case is with this but because i want to feel the gummies right so i'm gonna take a hit just to give a taste test all right so i'm gonna go ahead and bust one of these suckers open and like i said we're gonna be using the toki 510 thread battery one of my favorite batteries you guys know that and boom look at this right here this thing is clear bro super super freaking clear let's go ahead and do the bubble test i don't even know if a bubble test is a thing in the delta eight community but it's not moving so it's definitely very very thick with three c's my boys so go ahead slap this on here i'm gonna go ahead and see the light turn on once it's on boom so this is just a taste test i'm not going to go ahead and be taking blinkers off of this or anything because i want to taste the gummies first all right so cheers whoo yo that actually tastes really really freaking good dude hey where we might have to make of taking blinkers off a delta 8 thc though honestly let me know like run up the likes on this video if we could get maybe over 500 likes we'll do a specific video taking blinkers off of these cartridges but i forgot i was literally going to end the clip and i have to try these out for you guys all right so the first ones that we're going in are the blue ones that these are also i just read 100 vegan gummies and this one is a blue dream right a little inside look for you guys crystal little sugar cubes so i'm gonna go ahead and pop two of these cheers yo yo these are fire you don't taste any wheat in them or anything at all it just tastes up like it's straight up blue raspberry gummy so it's pretty fire pop two of those go ahead and pop these open these are the watermelon skittles honestly these could be even more fire so pop two of these suckers no i don't know if i'm gonna get baked or not but we'll see what happens man so here's a little card that they give you when you buy something off of the site i have a i have a discount code if you guys ever do because this thing is um illegal i think it's federally legal i'm not i don't remember but yeah it's not like regular thc you get a nice little card like this when you receive it so i'm gonna go ahead and end this clip out for you guys and i'll catch you guys in about 45 minutes to an hour when i feel something or i don't feel something but either way i'm gonna give you guys a little update and we'll be back guys so an hour and a half later right so this is what happened right so i went and ran some errands real quick i went to go take a shower because i was feeling a little bit dirty and then in the shower dude like while i was writing the errands i was like i was felt so rushed right everything would just felt so rushed but as soon as i hopped into the shower i felt like that's when the gummies took effect because i i like my mind was running so much and then boom i just got a a sudden calmness all right i just felt like super super relaxed and it wasn't like i didn't feel high but i just felt like relaxed like all of that stress all of that the things that i was thinking about i was just like gone right so it's very very very high on the calming side for me it's like i don't really feel any laziness any like couch lock anything like that that i would usually get from thc i mean delta nine thc like usually when i smoke delta 9 thc i don't know my thoughts feel really really clouded i feel like groggy i feel like very like yeah i feel faded but it's like not really like a very very calm fadedness unless it's a really really good indica but with this delta eight thc it's really really really calming and soothing and relaxing but you don't really get those really really super high psychoactive effects that you usually get from delta nine but to end off this other side of the um clip i'm going to go ahead and take a couple more hits because i'm pretty sure i'm not going to be able to feel the effects of this cartridge because i feel the effects of the gummies already but i do want to talk a little bit of this um delta 8. they did give me the info card right here so i was like why not talk with you guys for a little bit right but pretty much what they say in moonwalker the brand is this is what delta eight thc is so delta eight thc is also referred as d a and delta a blah blah is a rare cannabinoid found in the hemp plant right so delta athc is slightly psychoactive but less intoxicating than delta nine thc so then again that's why you're not feeling like that well that's all right i'm not feeling that super super crazy high it's like barely just that very very subtle calmness and how does it make me feel so delta eight is known for clarity euphoria and calming effects all right often resulting in a relaxed state of mind so that makes sense at lower doses delta eight can help you give the energy you may need to get through the day literally feel like i'm reading to a bunch of kids right now reading off of this but yeah man so this is honestly a pretty really good product if you really want to stray away from smoking too much of delta 9 thc because obviously you could build up a tolerance but if you still want to be smoking if you still want to feel that calmness like i personally do then you know this is the way to go delta a thc i'm definitely going to be using this a lot more i don't want to really do too much like you know 500 milligrams thousand milligrams like i do with thc or regular thc i mean um with this definitely gonna be like micro dosing it maybe a hundred milligrams a day so with that being said let's go ahead and end up this video with a nice little hit of the strawberry gelato um like i said if you guys want to see of blinkers or just taking fat at rips from the delta athc and giving you guys a real effect a real review of how it makes me feel when i'm completely sober just the cartridges themselves let's go ahead and run up the likes maybe if we could hit over 600 likes we'll definitely try to do that so cheers yo [Music] it's actually really really freaking smooth and the strawberry gelato sticks out so dang much all right i would i'm honestly really really interested and curious as to how the cartridges hit as opposed to delta nine thc cartridge so i don't know man it'd be an interesting video so i'm gonna go ahead and end out this video here if you guys enjoyed today's video man do me one favor smash the likes hit those comments and most importantly smash the subscribe button and we'll catch you guys on the next one", "mcKM_lkmf_M": "what's up and we are live and we're gonna do a review on the delta eight cigarettes from a lot of heights banana runts so yeah let's get to it um it hasn't been open yet like it's still sealed um have a dabber so we can open it up break that seal see what's up with it and let me just make sure my video is uploading right okay i think it's going good all right so let's uh break this hill and try him out so you can tell where you have to open it bam a little bit of dust on the sides but it happens with the shipping room sometimes they get a little shaken up okay this is a filled one it tastes like banana so got a little puff on it it tastes like banana lotto heights have some good stuff so i'm gonna be pretty good pretty sure got a really good taste tastes like banana straight off the bat not bad bad at all now there was some delta a in it you don't know what that is look it up some good stuff um says 400 milligrams for the whole thing so and there's 10 cigarettes i can't do the math right now but um you actually scan bar and i'll tell you how many milligrams it is let's do that i'll give you the last results it has a really good taste as that banana tastes really good oh well it doesn't have these ones yet but it has the other ones they have it's like 41 milligrams per cigarette not bad good stuff we also brought the puff coil um i'm gonna bust a dab out of that and do a review on some wax i got from the shop [Music] not too overpowering but it's there i believe they're putting like some banana distilled in it oh and i just don't mean terpenes well they like it's probably like they mix it with the distilled then it's like that not bad um it's the grayish whitish ash real smooth honestly it's not a bad not a bad thing it's real smooth i like i like how it tastes you still take cannabis but you also taste that banana these delta eights are really nice oh yeah you just tasted on undertones right there because it comes out so we are going to do another review on some concentrates i did get from california care group got some wax to try out from there and see how it is thank you thank you for checking it out good stuff um along the heights good stuff i like it i like this banana flavor it's really smoothing sometimes you have to see that it does make it really strong a little more i can make so i guess i don't know and again this gives it like a little bit different taste to it you guys came out the line at different flavors like you have here your banana runs and then you have like a blueberry one and you have like like you have like a blue dream one half [ __ ] um any other banana runs you see now you need like an og [ __ ] tangy you come with a tangy one that's just me bomb very nice nice nice nice nice i like them i'll definitely get them again um if you haven't checked them out check them out on their page atlanta heights check them out on instagram um i will tag them on their ig let me post it on their idea right now such a good taste honestly can't get a picture but [ __ ] it who cares we're live cigarette bomb um i'll definitely buy them and if you want to try some cb some delta eight and you want to try something a little flavor try this banana one it's also called grape i think grape will be a good flavor just like all good not bad well um we're gonna smoke a joint too so we'll get this going i could let it burn even you smoke these anywhere no and we're not like in the store or anything but it's illegal you know don't you keep getting through this the internet you can just buy it they'll ship it right to you the 10 pack um oh i almost dropped it but it's good i recommend trying them out if you are into trying different um cbd strange or you want to try sweet sugar and you like different ones you're trying to quit smoking cigarettes and it's the best routine to go it's better for you the adult eight will make you nice and relaxed well not bad at all let's um click dab and then we'll end the video smoking a joint we are going to take a dab of okay um [Music] first off i got these from california care group this is going into a different review but um california care group we got some grams of wax okay this is like pretty much csr you know crc whatever it's that [ __ ] white wax i don't know it wasn't like that but you know you know what we'll try it we'll dab it out one is this is the one i just showed you was um sugar cone and this one's um blueberry jerry not bad um photos did not show that it was um crc so we didn't know but we got it we're gonna dab it and we're gonna do just a review on one of them so we're gonna mix them up and then whatever one we pick is the one that we do review on so i'm gonna do a review on the blueberry jerry nice this one has a nice blueberry smell not bad it has to like a little yellow to it it wasn't like straight white like some other stuff i've been seeing but you know i was like you know what we'll just try it out and see how it is because you know california character appreciates some good stuff um we've gotten waxed up from them before no problems usually they're usually got some good stuff so let me do a little review on their wax so i think with the poco set up at 600 we don't hit the puff coat that much anymore we do but not as much before but we'll do it for the video right there so don't forget to check out hold on to heights cbd cigarettes or do that delta eight illegal thc you don't know what that is look it up some good [ __ ] and we do a puffco dab of some blueberry jerry from california care group and it should be vibrant right now before i say cheers it's not bad just have that blueberry taste to it slightly they don't taste like lime i like lemon like all those other ones i smell because i smell sometimes just smell like lemon but not bad i'll give it like a three point nine out of five it's not bad wearing it with a joint work this up and giving my reviews on these along to heights so if you're um in a state where they don't got thc products or you can't get cannabis in your state but you can get cbd i recommend these alonso heights banana runts delta eight pre-rolls their perfect has 40 milligrams or 42 milligrams and eat cigarette not bad um perfect for any time you want to smoke you know you want to go outside and you're trying to quit smoking cigarettes go have that i recommend checking them out popping on some if you don't want banana they have um this delta a and cbd it's also really good i've done a review check it out on some videos back i believe it's on there still should be on there i'm gonna reach out to them recommend some new flavors like blueberry bubble gum grape all kinds of flavors you know you know alonso heights got some good stuff they have some lavender ones i think lavender pre-rolls and it tastes good they taste amazing um um what is this alien og and then we got some wax in there so you're gonna see a little bit of oil on the sides so yeah um what do i rate these oh [ __ ] i'll write them four point five out of five real good [ __ ] um it tastes amazing um the only press sucks i get a little sticking up and you lose a little bit but hey it happens um but amazing things of this you know the packaging is nice it has a bananas in the back it says thank you um yeah the delta a if you haven't tried delta just try it out i recommend it and that's it um if you are in the eye area try out california caregiver that's a good product and then if you are a non-state that is if not doesn't have thc available and can you get cb try to amount of heights delta eight it's a legal thc product is illegal um thc made from hemp so oh so check them out and then we're gonna end the video right there it's a little longer than i wanted to make it but it's all good check them out alonto heights been out of runs um i believe they're going for 20 bucks a pack um check them out and order yourself a pack and enjoy it and that's it and have a great stony day", "DUuDGb_xce0": "[Music] what's up what's up what's up

some smoke tricks there we go that was it not too good at all doesn't matter are you all like mala blunt so far this couple more rows of their board I'm not moving it steady [Music] [ __ ] New Year's Eve to remember this video [Music]", "bJ1fzCovdkU": "a little testing of some CBD products that is what we're going to be doing today and I'm really excited down behind the the benefits of CBD especially since I'm a dancer and athlete I get injured a lot and not with dancing or being an athlete just because I'm accident-prone this morning so anyways I really really really really really like the benefits that CBD gives you because it's not tylenol it's not advil it's not all those painkillers that are super bad for your liver and all that it is healthy so there are look I can also bake I'm sorry there are a couple different ways that you can take in take in and they are it depends on like what you need so if let's say you have a sprained ankle or maybe your back is kind of hurting from a lot of working out or whatever you need continuing if you know you have a sore back from working out heavy weights or something like that I recommend the CBD cream on where you feel the soreness and tightness sorry my my computer is jingling because my dogs decide to itch themselves so there are a lot of different brands and different types of CBD cream this is one that you'll probably find in your nearest dispensary or smoke shop it's this one there's only 20 20 grams you IDI if you see that and it's called emu 420 essentials that's like one of the first brands that I think kind of came out with CBD and I open it it looks like that I kind of have used it a lot but it's just cream most of them are minty this one doesn't really have a flavor but or a smell and all you do is you just get a little bit and you rub it on you there's like a huge Harrison I'm gonna show you guys again without the hairs so this is what it looks like without a big hair and I we saw the first time but it's just cream and you get some and my neck is sore so I'm just gonna put some on my neck and yeah so I would recommend if you guys have sore muscles on your legs your your back your ankles anything like that and there is also another one another type that I have I definitely need this is like the one I'd go with because like my pain is gone for the rest of the day after I use it and it depends on how many milligrams of CBD are in your product is what you're gonna get out of the product so the higher the milligram the more potent it is this one's only a 20 milligram one so maybe if it's for your hands or maybe smaller parts of the body I would recommend but this is a thousand milligrams as you can see and this is like a painkiller i this one does smell like menthol so make sure you don't rub your eyes you gonna burn but I love this one I love putting it on anywhere that I'm sore it'll go away like within a little actually I'm touching into my food um it'll go away in probably five to ten minutes and for the rest of the day and I usually only apply it once and I don't feel whatever's bothering me so I definitely stand behind this one I'm not actually not sure where you guys can get this I'll figure it out because I order this from my special connect she's a doctor so she's a holistic doctor so she has the hook up to like all the strong stuff um anyways moving on so that is CBD cream I recommend this and definitely try it and tell me what you do on - oh actually another topical one that I'm gonna say before I get into the ones that we start eating I don't have it with me but I used it before and I have a picture of it and it's right here actually it's a patch that you put on whatever is sore and I think it had 40 milligrams of CBD I don't have the picture like with me or anything but yeah so it just looked like a patch kind of like a nicotine patch and you just put it on wherever it was sore and it stayed there I used to during the night not really when I was awake because if I sweat I don't want it to fall off or anything so I recommend doing it at night but put it on maybe a couple hours before you go to sleep to actually feel what it's doing and it I definitely like CBD because it relaxes you you just lay down drink some tea watching like spaz off and I think the it's the purpose of a patch is that it's a little bit more like targeting the point that's hurting and it just stays there so as a crane kind of when it soaks in that's kind of it and then it goes away eventually depending on how strong your cream is but the patch it stays there and I think it says it lasts up to like nine to 12 hours I don't know but the picture will be right here and again I got that for my friend but I'm dead I'm pretty sure they sell those at dispensaries or smoke shops nowadays but like they look like nicotine patches and those are awesome too and then another one that I don't have with me cuz I already used it our CBD joint CBD pre-rolls and they are like these I counted a four cuz I know it's there for second video anyway so I'm like if I'm doing this for too long mhm that's but um that is a CVD pre-roll and you actually smoke that that one I don't I forgot how many milligrams it was like what ten twenty hundred it'll say it'll show you in the video but that one for me I didn't really like see anything I was just like kind of like smoking grass I mean everyone it hits everyone differently and everything affects everyone differently so to me I just didn't really see anything with it so those I don't know hit or miss they're cheap they're like five or ten bucks so if you want to try out for fun why not try one with a friend I mean I did smoke it with a friend so maybe if since I shared it like I didn't get as much of the product but I didn't really feel anything so anyway it's moving on so this is gonna look weird but it's not these are actually called syringes and some CBD products are they they're packaged like this because they're for one-time use daily uses this one is a thousand milligrams formula so yes good awesome the more the zeros them the more the pain relief and I already opened it so I can just open it easier yeah I want you guys to see me struggle and this is from Green rows and see it's a daily dose it's a daily dose so that's why they put them in syringes this one is approximately 33 milligrams so out of the thousand milligram like it's a thousand milligrams but there's 33 milligrams of it in this little syringe talks what that means everyone's like well you're only doing 33 milligram that's not really a lot no it is it's a thousand milligrams and it's 33 milligrams of a middle of a thousand milligram situation okay so this one actually do with you guys for you guys it looks like Diaz it's nothing crazy this one actually tastes really gross I don't have water with me so you guys are just gonna see me die fun and so some people depending on their their tolerance their I'll do the holster inch or some of the syringe I'll just do some of the syringe just because it's not my time and it's not when I'm gonna go to bed and I'm gonna go to work in a little bit so I don't be like just executing so I'll do a little bit also cuz it tastes really gross so I put it under the time so I try to taste it as least as possible because this does not taste great but it's worth it anyways so you just put a little bit uh-huh and you eat it oof I don't like this one because because Oh No okay so and it's not see it was like that look a second okay so yeah that's the syringe and those are fun so that these are the now the ones that you can kind of ingest and put in your mouth and then the most them they also have pills I don't want pills but CBD pills I don't know how those work let me know maybe I should get those and see how they are is our tinctures they look like this so they look like little vials and you this one's empty but it's a different brand so I thought I'd show to you it's called loser and this is another high high milligram see media I keep squinting because I'm not wearing glasses and I still ad put my contact so anyways I'm like can you guys new okay anyways this is a thousand milligrams so of course depending on how great you want to feel is how much you want to fill the vial and I just fill it this one's empty but I'm just showing a tumor where I feel it under the tongue and boom I have another one here it is called CBD oil plus hemp spray but it's not really hairspray because it's a bottle and I can't see that hey no fighting in my video please boys sorry my dogs on the bed on my please I'm almost done hey and this one actually is cafe mocha so I can want to try it I've never had flavoured ones before oh wait just kidding oh this one's kind of this one what stick oh damn okay I'm not sure oh okay I haven't never seen this one with some samples I'm gonna do a very little bit wash that was really good I'm sure but yeah so this is a teamster so if you're feeling pain if you want to relax tinctures are for it happens a little bit quicker because you're ingesting it and then this is another type of tincture as well it's called Charlotte's Web it's made by the Stanley Brothers which is a good good good brand I've heard oh and this one's mint chocolate I don't open yet though because it looks like a really pretty bottle but they make this in called Colorado and it's made really well and it's another teacher so yeah and that's about it for my CBD video I definitely recommend CBD for pain and relaxation and definitely natural remedies that you want to find I've been using it for years ever since I was playing volleyball in high school and it's been helping me ever since and I stand by it and let me know what you think I hope you guys like my video let me know what else you guys want to try oh I also know that there are CBD edibles like you can eat them so but I've never tried those but I do know there are those as well but anyway so if you guys enjoyed it and thank you so much for watching bye [Music]", "T_2sHRevx3Q": "hey guys it's Holly here and tomorrow is the fourth of July as you know with fourth of July means there's gonna be lots of parties there's gonna be lots of celebrations there's gonna be lots of drinking and there's gonna be tons of food so with that being said I've put together five different party foods that are going to be great for these kinds of celebrations and not just tomorrow but for any type of party and in macro friendly and to help celebrate the fourth of July we are actually having a sale tomorrow on all of our ebooks including my complete contest prep recipe guides which you can find some of these recipes and tons more macro friendly recipes available so the five party free recipes that I have given to you guys are number one a platter platters are traditionally very rich in fact they're very calorie dense so I've given you some suggestions of how to make your platter macro friendly number one thing I'm always looking for when I'm preparing a platter is one of the protein sources because traditionally very low protein if your competitor or someone that's trying to keep a good physique then I like to have protein on that plate okay so next onto these veggies so I've chosen to use cucumbers celery and a sugar-free dill pickle the reason I've chosen these is because they are the lowest in carbohydrates out of most of the vegetables that we can use on Plateau compared to carrot for example or peppers and I also usually use a Tutsi key so Tutsi key is basically a yoghurt and a cucumber with some garlic and other herbs and again it's very low in calories so that is my go-to for dip platters the second recipe is top ten tips and a buffalo dip again traditionally very high in calories due to the fats and carbohydrates this recipe is super high in protein very low in carbs and fats [Music] styling with the chips traditionally your tostito chips are very high in calories and are also very high in sodium I've got a little trick for you guys to still be able to enjoy some crispy chips but without all those calories and I'm using and my favorites Josef lavish bread so all i've taken to make these chips is three of the joseph's lavish breads I've sliced them into three columns and cut them into triangles it's so quick and easy the macros are something like this for a single serving is nine grams of protein 14 grams of carbohydrate and 3 grams of fat for the whole rack so you can compare this to a regular tortilla chip which should be much higher in carbohydrate much higher in fat and lower in protein and dietary fiber all right so onto the buffalo dip [Music] you're probably wondering how this is go to be in hot high protein we've actually added some cool chicken to this recipe it's literally four ingredients the key ingredient is this mores original buffalo sauce now usually the sources like this that are rich and creamy a very fine fat this one has 1.5 grams of fat per serving which is 15 meals you can guarantee that when you try this dip you're going to absolutely love it and I'll be listing the macros for you for the dip per serving the third recipe is pig in a blanket or if you're from Australia this would be called a sausage roll up I love the differences between countries so these are much and more macro friendly these are typically really low value low quality meats and also very rich in carbohydrates and fats because of the pastry I've got some tips for you guys to make these lower calories so these are super fun to make really easy and it's so much better for us than the traditional store bought version so how to make the blanket I can't handle the name the other key ingredients to making these is the outside and I'm going to be using bread instead of pastry which is what's traditionally used to make that crispy outside finish sorry small small sacrifice on the Chris penis but for the macros that you're gonna save by making this small substitution definitely worth it the dipping sauce super easy but much more macro friendly is just G use sugar-free ketchup all right onto the sweets number four I have doughnuts festive doughnuts these are absolutely delicious and we've decorated them in some fun festive fourth-of-july colors but again you can use any decorations II like depending on the occasion [Music] these are so easy to make they take 10 minutes in the oven and the macros are just awesome 2 grams of protein half the gram of fat and 10 grams of carbs I'm sold the last recipe is the salted caramel layered cheesecakes this recipe is straight out of my contest prep recipe guide so you can go and check that out and you'll have access to the base or the foundations to make this I've added a few tweaks here today so that you can make it a little bit more festive to kind of blend in with a theme of the fourth of July thank you so much for watching guys I had a blast making these and I hope you enjoy them as much as I will tomorrow if you'd like a copy of my complete recipe guide and any of our other books for that matter you can head down to the description and find the links below as for me [Music]", "J7Z4P-Ejj08": "all righty so let's get started here this is the first time I'm gonna do a voiceover let's see if you guys like a video like this I already edited this video but right here for grabbing some wheat some dank dank I think this is wedding cake I got this from the plug so I do not get this from any club so this is wedding cake and it's on fire so I'm gonna show you guys how I roll my little site bullet joints cuz I don't do it cone style but you break them nugs apart boom boom boom you see that you see how I'm playing that [ __ ] into the grinder I don't really like to break them down into little noise I'd like to just like spread it out within the grinder and just like force it into the grinder if you guys did in any other way let me know but this is the way that I do it and it works so I'm sticking with it but if you guys want if you guys think there's an easier way if you guys know an easier way let me know and I'll do it but boom put that [ __ ] in there put all that weed in there boom boom boom you see that it's a little harder to find because it's sticky I put a lot of weed in there so I have to figure out another way and then I ended up just using manpower 1 boom boom there it is what's good what it was good with it empty it all out you see do a final [ __ ] Oh an organic raw organic hemp only that I only like to smoke those um I don't if there's an if I don't if I have whatever I'll roll whatever like I don't mind but preferably I like to stick to organic hemp there we go the tips as well I like the longer skinny ones opposed to using the shorter and like fatter ones but I used three it might be a little too much but let me know what you guys think I like house like farming gets so at this point after you've done like grinded up the weed you stuff up the paper stuff it up as much as you can um or as big as you want it you know what I mean like there's no right or quantity of how much we put into a joint you know what I mean you fill it up as much as you can or as much yeah as much as you can basically as much as you want on my case just because I already know kinda how to roll like a decent joint I would say I put as much weed as I can and I usually smoke with people so I like to roll them fat so boom I'll put all the weed I can in there there you go half time done scooping it I'm gonna grab it from one end and the other I'm gonna pinch it you see how I'm pinching it right there and then I'm not asking it I'm telling it to mold you see how I'm holding it right there and it's easier on like better quality weed because it sticks together and you could like mold it in the way but yeah you see how I'm like twisting it like I'm like trying to mold it into like the cylinder shape and yes of course weed is always gonna fall but you just push that you just shove it back in there and mold it as you guys can see there's weed falling all over the place on my leg and on the tray so I'm gonna scoop that all back up later and just pour it back into the joint like weeds always gonna fall you see how I'm still I'm still struggle not struggling but I'm still molding it you know what I mean like look now I could just hold it with one with like two fingers and gather up more weed to stuff in there I'm after you've molded a it like the we should stay if it's good if it's good but it should stay the way that you formed it so there we are [Music] [Music] all right so at this point I feel like it's already all the weight that I need is in there so now I'm gonna start and like tuck the paper over make sure that the inner layer of the paper is tucked in and then tuck the other paper over I don't know if I'm explaining it right but hopefully look you could probably see it in a bit you see how the top paper is lapping over and at this point I'm licking it lick it there you go blowing seal that [ __ ] after that the wheat should not fall out you have yourself to basically the joints already there there's a little bit of there's a little bit of wheat that fell out there I'm sorry guys but yes it did fall um but we could always scoop it in and pack it in like I'm about to do right now but that's basically the giant already there guys after that is making the filter and I'll show you guys how to do that in just a second let me just finish packing this guy up because why not all right tap it gently it seems like I'm putting a lot of pressure but in reality I'm not try to be gentle with it don't pack it too tight but also don't leave it too loose you want to have the perfect airway so that the joint can breathe and burn evenly besides that you ready to smoke up we see I just twisted the see that how it's like an accordion but and the second sheet for the tip I'm gonna just loop it around that that way there's it builds up pressure and when it opens up inside of the joint it's a pretty tight crutch but yeah like now I'm using a third one to work lap around the other second one and there you go it was a tip put it in there and it'll spread open and there you go and your joints ready to go ready to smoke and then now I'm gonna just keep adding more weed because know we've left behind right as much as I can boom boom boom other times I like to like leave a little bit of the tip open but this time I was like [ __ ] yo and I was try to use as much weight as possible and there you go there's your joint sport that [ __ ] up [Music]", "az-3fYMF1KE": "healthiest types of bread bread belongs to the major groups of food

can't look I don't know if any of y'all's have been counting cuz I just like avid but I can tell you I've gotten way more hits out of this joint then I ever would out of a point and pretty much anything else [Music] now will I be doing this very often hell no but I just might make another video to see if I can roll on even smaller plays it's got to be one of the smaller joints I've ever

first impression good can you see it oh wow I know it's good yeah I know this is from 420 CBD hemp flour direct see it smells really good it's really really strong um I think this is these are pretty dense these are really really really dense real good I guess isn't purple in there oh yeah listen darling see this is another another deal where it's one one buds really dark and one but it's really light looks really nice even without to my magnifying glass oh yeah there's some hairs in there too okay so let's give this a taste maybe go with the cuz I'm an imperial so this piece me it's really strong with terpene really really strong it's really um right in the front of the tongue really really really bitter hmm that's pretty strong stuff and it's really fibery like like it's nuit it's still and I don't think it's fully dried yet it's still kind of moist I mean it doesn't feel it to touch it though but to chew it it's kind of chewy and moist it's not all dry like it looks it's really nice slowly strong potent terpene though wait all right so I guess we'll just take off at this bud I think I looks really bright even though it's dead darker the - it still looks pretty bright I can see the orange hairs they look really nice okay that looks like good light there yes pretty nice look how I got all right so we're gonna put some in our taster it's called a glass taster taste it hmm does it taste moldy no no it doesn't taste like blue cheese like moldy whatnot but it's very dry like it doesn't feel very dry but it's still it has like very dry smoke to it it's like it's like the middle the back of my throat just get super family here all right so being that they were both two different two different colors one light green in one dark green I'm gonna have to start figuring out what causes that I don't know maybe if it's just where it's groaner where's positioned in the field or what but it's now that I'm seeing it more and more it makes me curious so I don't done you guys see me now you can see I didn't really be able to see him exhale Wow cameraman Scott he's got really good lungs compared to me you see all that that's crazy get it on the way out or away guys don't get to move around a lot really underneath yeah there you go so what do you think camera is it dry them to you when you feel feel dry yes or no no yeah that's why there's tool this year so the daily thing the daily thing the packaging is black that's different I mean if I was like packaging blue cheese I would like maybe make the wrapper look like a cheese you know I'd be pretty cooling the Marbley blue cheese and this sticker would be kind of something that I would probably do the the picture itself isn't bad as again I still like the uh being able to see the one side in the package um its overall smell and taste it was very punchy any smell it's very strong um I can't say earthy I mean I hear that a lot very earthy smell um I can't I didn't get that with this I got more like a more like a probably a sweet grassy smell an earthy smell because to me Earth doesn't smell like screwed grass to me earth smells kind of like dirty wood so I don't get an earth smell what's that and doughy wood dirty would like doyou know like you go into a barn and it's like the wooden air is like Oh dusty and dirty and it has that smell that's the earthy smell to me whereas this is more like a sweet grassy smell like like maybe like you just not like you just mowed the lawn but sort of like that it's good grass smell so tasting it was very strong um it was fibery but not dry but yet the smoke was kind of dry so that was kind of like it's kind of just disconcerning in some ways me like so it's not necessarily bad just being with the things that it kind of had as traits I wasn't expecting that and its flavor when we smoked it was still pretty good even though the smoke was still kind of even dry and third category would I would I would I give it in one to five stars one being the worst by being the best um I give it a four and a half we not feeling it feels pretty good yeah I mean I give it a four and a half it feels good it was it displeasing in flavor and what I recommend the product yes I personally would recommend this product two reasons one is potent I feel it I'm not sure how much is this probably at least 16 percent to you've seen here fuels in 70 what's that it means see really early SRC THC amen I'm sorry guys um you know these things happen I would say there's at least 16% CBD my mistake well you know why I said that because I just read that Michigan and and was you know state Utah they're all legalizing so sorry you know maybe that's probably what um actually they did legalize recreational so I'm saying it must be at least 16 percent CBD in here I mean it it feels pretty good you know it's not like over the edge medicated but it feels good so it's not like in the 19 or 20 let's say it's in around the 16 percent um so that's why I would recommend it that and the fact that it's very dense and it's very good it looks great these buds look great and they're very dense which means you're going to get a lot out of it when you break it up and that little bits going become a whole bunch and supplemented with like some like some high slit or something you know on top if you did it in a bowl I'd be really cool I think that would really like set it off in fact um I think if we do another if we do another review here soon of some concentrates we should use this to put it smoking in a bowl most people do it in a matter they're do it on the nail you know you've seen it but there's other ways you can use it so why not I think that'd be good for that don't forget the contest in it hashtag in it number two win like subscribe

"xLU7c0Ty_eo": "Hello everyone! Today we use P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e to make a raisin bread The bread is evenly coloured, and the overall brownish-red texture is very beautiful and attractive Slowly fermented P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e and fully soaked raisins With proper ingredients and technology Can increase the flavour and taste of bread It can also moisturize and delay the aging of bread The bread still tastes moist and soft on the third day, fresh as ever! The bread has very good drawing effect too Can easily pull out slices of bread that are soft and light like feathers It tastes moist, soft, and elastic With every bite you can experience the rich taste of raisins and P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e The amount of P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e is relatively small. It is recommended to make two or more at a time. The rest can be divided and frozen for 3 month. 75g bread flour,  add 52g of cold water (water temperature is 3C in summer and 10C in winter) Mix well to a soft dough without dry flour When the dough is too dry and too wet, you can add a little flour or cold water to adjust After covering, let the dough stand for 15-30 minutes at room temperature to fully hydrate the dough to produce gluten Add 1/8 tsp instant yeast Knead evenly Add 1.5g table salt Knead for about 5-6 minutes until the dough is smooth, soft and elastic It can pull a relatively smooth thick film After covering, ferment for 1 hour at room temperature 22-25C After 1 hour, gently rub the old noodles to exhaust Cover it and put it in the refrigerator to ferment for more than 12 hours before use 120g raisins add 30g water, mix well and soak Stir 1-2 times in the middle Cover it and put it in the refrigerator overnight for next day use Add 550g bread flour 30g sugar 5g instant yeast 7g salt 40g condensed milk Add 120g milk, 240g cold water (reserve 10% for adjustment) The temperature of milk and water, 10-15C in winter, 3-5C in summer Stir evenly at the lowest speed Add the remaining cold water according to the water absorption of the dough Stir well and refrigerate for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate to produce gluten This is the P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e fermented overnight The interior is full of net-like structure and has a light wine aroma Divide the P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e into small pieces and mix with the main dough Stir evenly with low speed 2 gears, it takes about 2 minutes Turn on medium speed 4th gear and knead for about 2-3 minutes The dough with P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e is easy to develop the gluten, be careful not to over knead When the opened membrane is translucent, relatively smooth and elastic, and the hole has rough jagged edges, add butter Add 46g of softened butter Use a scraper to cut the dough for easy mixing with butter Stir at low speed 2 gears Until all the butter is mixed into the dough, it takes about 3 minutes Then turn to the 4th gear to knead I kneaded for about 2-3 minutes When the surface of the dough is relatively smooth, do windowpane test to check the state of the dough When the dough is very elastic, you can pull out a thin, translucent membrane. The membrane hole that I opened here still has some jagged teeth. You can continue to knead it at low speed for 1-2 minutes This is the membrane that is pulled after 2 minutes of low speed kneading, smoother and more elastic The kneading can be ended when there is a little jagged in the membrane hole Pour in the soaked raisins twice Mix the raisins with the dough by folding to prevent damage to gluten Then mix the raisins and dough at the lowest speed for 30-60 seconds Fold and mix again to distribute the raisins evenly into the dough Fold and smooth the surface and put it in a greased basin Fermented at 26C for 1-1.5 hours to 2double size after covering Dip your finger with flour and poke a hole in the dough If the dough does not rebound or shrink, the dough ferment just right, and the dough will collapse and if over ferment. Divide evenly into 8 portions Gently round until the surface is smooth Cover and rest for 30 minutes Roll the dough into a rectangle about 16x12cm Turn the dough over, smooth side down Gently fold 4 layers Cover and relax for 10-15 minutes Roll the dough into a strip Turn it over and organize it into a 29cm long strip The width is slightly smaller than the width of the baking box Gently roll up 2.5-3 turns Put the dough into the greased 9\"x4\"x4\" baking pan in the same spiral direction Cover and proof until 80% full It takes about 1-1.5 hours at 26C  Bake at the lower layer for 32-36 minutes in an oven preheated to 180C/350F Demoulding and cooling after baking The bread is evenly coloured, and the overall brownish-red texture is very beautiful and attractive Very soft and has a very good drawing effect too Can easily pull out slices of bread that are soft and light like feathers Slowly fermented P\u00e2te Ferment\u00e9e and fully soaked raisins Both increase the flavour and taste of bread It can also moisturize and delay the aging of bread The bread is sealed and stored after it has cooled completely, and it is still very moist and soft on the third day This bread tastes

cooking Whitacre and today my husband Donald and I will show you how to make it a bit pavlova whoo I always love how like pavlova czar and this eBay version is delicious we're going to make an ube coconut meringue base fill it with a bit cream and then top it off with some chopped mangoes to start take 4 eggs and taking one egg at a time carefully crack them into a bowl then using your hands separate the egg yolk from the egg white like this save the yolks into a separate Bowl and transfer the egg white into a large stainless steel or a glass mixing bowl and make sure that the bowl for the egg whites is completely clean and dry residual oil will prevent the egg whites from whipping up properly so avoid using plastic bowls as they tend to retain oil save the egg yolks in the fridge to use for another dish and then set the egg whites aside and let them come to room temperature which should take about 30 minutes to 1 hour in the meantime pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit then take a baking dish and fit with parchment paper then draw an 8 inch circle in the middle of the parchment paper and flip the paper over so the ink side is down this is so that the ink doesn't get into our meringue when we bake it when the egg whites have come to room temperature start beating the egg whites at low speed for about 2 to 3 minutes until they become phony like this then turn the beater up to medium speed and while continuing to beat very slowly added one cup of granulated sugar one tablespoon at a time as the meringue thickens up like this when all the sugar is added turn up the speed to high and continue to beat feel the meringue with your fingers if you feel grains from the sugar continue beating at high speed until it's smooth you should no longer feel any sugar grains and you should see stick glossy Peaks like this then using a sieve add 2 teaspoons of cornstarch 1/2 a teaspoon of cream of tarter 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of baking powder sift this in then carefully fold it into the meringue add in 1/3 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes and again carefully fold this in using the leftover meringue on the beaters dab some meringue on the four corners on the back of your parchment paper so the corners don't flap up while baking and the parchment paper can't slide around transfer your meringue onto the prepared parchment paper circle shape the meringue so that as much as possible it fits within the confines of that circle you can make that bowl shape by using your spatula to carve out a hollow space in the middle like this and creating upwards strokes to make taller edges along the outer circumference of your circle like this when you're happy with the shape of the meringue place it in the lowest rack possible in your oven close the oven door and turn down the temperature to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're doing this to ensure that the bottom and the outer edges of the meringue get nice and crisp and dry but the inside texture remains soft and marshmallow a we're going to bake this in our oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes then turn off the oven heat but don't open the oven door then with the oven door closed leave the meringue in the switched-off oven for 3 hours to overnight in the meantime we're going to make our Obon cream again take a stainless steel or glass bowl add in 1 cup of very cold heavy cream beef is on speed to whip up and thicken the heavy cream add in one tablespoon of granulated sugar and continue beating this mixture till you see stiff peaks like this when it's almost done add 1 TSP of booba extract and mix till it's uniform and smooth like this then take a spoon and scrape down the bowl to make sure everything it's fully mixed leave this in the fridge until you're ready to assemble the pavlova our meringue base is done as it surfaces are nicely crisp and dry now we're ready to assemble our pavlova now keep in mind that as soon as you add that Lubeck cream and fruit the meringue will start to lose its shape from all the moisture so only assemble your pavlova just before you're ready to serve it transfer the Rubik coconut meringue base onto your serving plate then add the uber cream onto the marais filling it up and spreading it onto the edges of the bowl shaped meringue base this uber cream will prevent the juices from the mangoes from soaking into the meringue that finally top the cream with 1 cup of sliced mango cubes like this and there you have it a bit coconut pavlova I've set up young and the meringue just melts in your mouth and the whooping cream pairs perfectly with the mangoes delicious thank you all so much for watching please let us know in the comment section below if you're planning to make this gubeck coconut pavlova and if you like

"m12ETuHky-c": "[Music] today we have got a keto classic cheesecake that is a 4.5 star rating on the internet stay tuned [Music] hi guys welcome to cook with mel if you're returning welcome back if you're new here please consider subscribing and hit the notification bell so you get all our recipes today we are doing a keto classic cheesecake recipe by one of my favorite recipe creators chocolate covered katie over 400 people have rated this cheesecake as the best keto cheesecake they've ever tasted this five ingredient cheesecake does need to refrigerate after it's baked for 24 hours so give yourself some time to make it we also give you a recipe for a thin beautiful crust and we show you how to take your cheesecake to the next level with the strawberry topping let's get into that recipe now we're going to grease and line your cake tin and you can see how i did mine i took the time to cut out baking paper and lined the bottom and the sides and then just to prevent any water seeping through because we're going to bake this in a bath you're going to protect the bottom just by lining the outside with foil okay so this is what i've done with the foil i have just wrapped it around up to about halfway of your pan and that should protect any water seeping through and when i say bath this is what i mean you're going to take a tray that your catin can fit in and we are going to pour some water in me okay that's to about halfway and i placed my caketon in the oven tray just to make sure i didn't overfill it with water and to about halfway is fine and now we're going to remove the patent from the oven tray and set your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 150 degrees celsius place your oven tray in the oven while it's warming so that the water heats up as well before we get into our five ingredient cheesecake and really it's just the filling i want to show you how to add a thin crust and for that we're going to to a bowl we're going to add a half a cup of nut that's ground so i'm using walnuts but you can use pecan nuts as well and a half a cup of almond flour half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder quarter teaspoon of salt a tablespoon of coconut oil that is in liquid form and lastly a tablespoon of water and you're just going to mix that all up until it's a thick crusty kind of paste if you like pecan nuts and walnuts have a sweetness to it so i think this crust is going to be delicious that's ready now so when you flatten it it should be able to form a solid piece if you like or surface and now we are going to line our baking tray because of course this is the crust add all of your crust mixture and you can spread that around and now we're going to flatten it into the base just a few tips um when doing your crust you just use your fingers to press down and if you are short at the end of it you just move move the dough or crust mixture up so they're gently up so that it does end up filling it is very movable so you shouldn't have an issue and if it turned out like this for me it should for you as well set your pen aside now and let's make the cream cheese filling so their crust was totally optional i just wanted to give you the choice of whether you wanted a crust on your cheesecake so this filling that we're going to prepare you just add it all to the cake tin as we showed you you know how to prepare cajun before to a bowl you're going to add 720 grams of cream cheese at room temperature like this then 420 grams of sour cream also at room temperature and you can use a mixer but i'm doing this by hand because we cannot overbeat or be too much this mixture because it will end up cracking so i want to be able to control how much beating i do next two and a half teaspoons of vanilla all right that's what our vanilla added 96 grams or two thirds of a cup of powdered sweetener and i my preference is monk fruit but you use the sweetener that you love the most 30 grams or a quarter cup of almond flour and also we have all our measurements in the description box just you know for your shopping and this is totally optional you don't have to add this but i'm adding a tablespoon of lemon juice for flavor now we're going to mix all of this hot mess together okay this is how i got it i found it really um you know tough to do it by hand so i put my hand beaches on for about maybe a minute i just ran it right through the cheesecake filling and that was fine um it has got a little lumps in there but i think it's the almond flour from you know because almond flour can be quite grainy so i think that's what it is so now we are ready to fill our cake pan with this cheesecake filling add all of your cheesecake filling now on top of the crust if you have made a crust or straight into your cake tin that's only half the filling by the way i'm just gonna make sure the bottom is fully fold in before i add the next slot and also i mean to say when uh you place your oven tray in your oven just make sure it's on the middle rack all right the rest of it this is going to be a huge cheesecake okay i have flattened my surface very well and the cake comes up about maybe about half to two thirds of the baking pan i'm not sure what other tips i could give you if you are using a nine inch cake tin you're going to bake it for 30 minutes and if you're using an 8 inch like i am you're going to bake it for 38 minutes and when you bake it please don't open the oven just let it do its thing all by itself right in the oven it goes bake time is up turn off your oven and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for five minutes and now we're going to remove it [Music] you can see this as well to me this is exactly what a cheesecake supposed to look like you've got a browning on the top and everything looks gorgeous however this cheesecake is not complete at this point yes we've baked it in the oven but you will find that it's quite jiggly at the moment and to settle it down and to further solidify we need to refrigerate for 24 hours i'm just removing the foil from the bottom of the pan and this is now going indicating straight into our refrigerator your cheesecake would be absolutely beautiful without a thin crust and without the topping that i'm about to show you how to make but if you want something that's really decadent and beautiful include the crust and include this topping i've got here airplane jelly now aeroplane jelly is 0.1 grams of carbohydrates it's really nothing there's no additives uh you know a spartan and all the things that you know some people fear with using um pre-produced products so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to make one sachet which will give you 500 moles of jelly so i'm just going to add that to a heat proof jug and add a cup of boiling hot water and then dissolve that so i'm gonna whisk it and once it's dissolved add another cup of cold water and this is strawberry jelly because i've got strawberries in the fridge and i'll show you what i'm gonna do with that okay as you can see i've added my cold water and this is 500 mils and the instructions say to let it sit for four hours but we don't actually want the jelly to sit we want it in a cold liquid form because we're going to pour it over the top of the cheesecake to make a beautiful strawberry topping so i'm gonna let this cool down and put it in the fridge for two hours just until it's like a chilled drink if you like and then we are going to whip out our cheesecake and finish off the topping i'm going to show you how to take this cheesecake up a notch and to do that i've cut some strawberries and we are going to line the edge of the cake and the cake tin with these strawberries now that you've got your strawberries lined we are going to need to get your jelly mixture sorted so we're going to add some gelatin just to make sure that it is a thick solid jelly on top of you know your cheesecake so to that we're going to add a tablespoon of gelatin to your jelly mixture and then you're going to whisk it this is my uh jelly mixture with the gelatin fully uh dissolved that's just little bubbles in there but i did check everything is dissolved well the gelatin and now i'm just going to pour this directly over the cheesecake are you nervous for me and now that goes in the fridge until it seats let's just come out of the fridge 24 hours of refrigeration time and i think i need to show you this just going to give that a shake it's completely solid and i cut my strawberries really thin so i have one there and i do want to talk about it in case this happens to you i have one there that's slightly bent so i'm just going to work my way and just maybe try well if that happens to you just push it back because now we are going to top this off with a little bit of cream and just whipped cream with a tablespoon well one cup of whipped cream with a tablespoon of sweetener ta-da and now we're just going to remove everything it should all be um quite solid look how exciting is that i think if you serve this to non non-keto now family and friends they would never believe how low-carb this cheesecake is i myself i'm more than impressed and i can't wait to tuck in it's just i'm actually speechless thank you so much for watching me have fun in the kitchen stay safe and be well right can i eat it now", "Un3H55SOXHM": "hi for today's recipe we're going to be making snickerdoodles here's what Jade 2 and a half cups of flour 2 teaspoons of cream of tartar 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 2 eggs room temperature 1 teaspoon of vanilla one and a half cups of sugar one cup or two sticks of butter unsalted and if you do use salted leave the salt out first things first we're going to add our sugar and our butter into our mixer and we're going to beat that using a simple paddle attachment we're gonna mix our butter and sugar on medium speed until it's light and fluffy and at the meantime we are going to sift it makes our time [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] scrape down the sides if you need to and we're looking for a very light and fluffy consistency and a very filial [Applause] we're going to lower the speed and we're gonna add our eggs in one at a time and then we're gonna add one teaspoon vanilla [Applause] [Applause] [Music] this has been mixing for about three minutes and it's fully incorporated so make sure you're scraping down their sides periodically to make sure that you have all the ingredients mixed in there fully you can also use a rubber spatula to do this I'm going to start by adding half of them to the egg and butter mixture then I'm going to mix it on low speed [Applause] once that's fully incorporated add the rest of your driver kids [Applause] and strict asides periodically just to make sure that it's fully incorporated [Applause] now that you're done it should have this kind of consistency very thick but also kind of soft if you haven't already you want to take this time to pre-heat your oven to 375 I also have all the conversions the four measurements and temperature is down just down in the description box below we are also going to need cinnamon ground cinnamon and large crystal sugar sugar is fully incorporated and this is a fairly large scoop so I'll be baking it for longer but if you do have a smaller scoop you're going to leave it in the oven for less time once the cookies are scooped you're going to set them aside to chill for about five to ten minutes just so that it's easier to roll into cinnamon sugar and if you use an ice cream scoop you're going to get perfectly uniform cookies every single time while my daughter's children I'm gonna mix together my sugar and I'm going to mix that with ground cinnamon the ratio just depends on how much cinnamon you want it I like a lot of cinnamon and not too much sugar so I'm going to do half a cup not measuring just eyeballing but two spoonfuls of cinnamon my dough's been chilling for about three minutes that just kind of makes it a bit firm and easier to roll and do cinnamon sugar mixture and your preheated you can go in about 12 minutes in the oven and you know they're cooked because the tops are cracked and they've spread and the edges are a nice golden brown", "2canTT_2Qn0": "what's up guys this is Derek house with the protein chef and today I'm gonna show you all how to make my healthy by heat a meatloaf this is a spin on one of my favorite meals and if

case you haven't already been spending all of your extra free time making bread I'm here with the recipe to help you start today I am showing you my favorite recipe for baguettes now I know I say this but a lot of things that these are really easy to make and they also have the extra little added bonus of making your whole kitchen smell like fresh baked bread now if you want to make these than all the ingredients and measurements are down below so check that out if you want to make we were going to start the night before by adding our first smaller quantities of flour water salt and yeast as you can see I am mixing this in a Tupperware so it's really easy to put the lid on and let rest at room temperature for 12 hours so we are gonna come back to it 12 hours later when it looks a little something like this and we'll come back to that in a minute but for now we're going to mix together our second quantities of flour and water in the bowl of a stand mixer just until combined [Music] then we're going to cover that and let it rest for 30 minutes 30 minutes later we can mix the rest of our dough so into our Bowl we are going to add our last quantity of salt and yeast as well as our pre fermented dough and we're going to mix that on a medium speed for around 7 minutes this is done when you were able to stretch the dough to a thickness that you can see light through without it ripping a hole at this point you are going to round up your dough and let it rest for an hour after an hour we are ready to shape our bag so we are going to start by dividing this in to mine ended up weighing 360 grams each so go ahead and weigh it and divide it and then we can shape our baguette now to shape them you're going to go ahead and lightly stretch it into a rectangular shape then you're going to fold the top to the middle of the bottom to the middle then the new top and bottom in half and you're going to seal it shut with the heel of your hand now you're going to roll this out slightly tapering ends to around 15 inches in length and then we can let them rise once more now to proof we are going to put these in a flowered kitchen towel and you're just going to fold up a little wall and between the baguette so that they don't stick to each other while they're rising then you can cover these up and I like to let them rest at room temperature for an hour and then I put them in the fridge for another half an hour because it makes them a little bit easier to handle later on now to bake these you are going to want to turn your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit and before turning the oven on put a baking tray in and let it come to heat with the oven once the oven is hot you can take your warm tray out of the oven and put your cold baguettes onto it and now we are going to score them scoring helps the steam escape while they are baking and it also gives them a little bit of a decoration so using a very sharp knife or a razor blade you're going to want to put three cuts in the top of the baguette now when making these cuts you want them to be as straight as possible and not in a diagonal when you think about if I get I know that you see the cut and its diagonal but when you bake it it gets exaggerated so if you started with a straight cut it'll turn into a diagonal but if you start with a diagonal cut because of the way the bread Rises it would get exaggerated and you would end up with a bigot that is sort of shaped like a peanut and you don't really want that so you want to keep these lines almost completely straight up and down without them running into each other so these are going to go into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes and as soon as you put them in the oven you want to spray them with some water now this is because it creates some steam in the oven and it allows the bread to rise to its full extent if you don't have a clean spray bottle that you can use then what you can do is have an oven safe dish fill it with some water and put it in the bottom of the oven and it'll create a little bit of steam in there as well now you can take these out when they are nice and crispy on the outside and a beautiful deep of golden brown and we're done as always I would recommend that you eat these as soon as possible these are homemade baguettes and not store-bought so they will stale just a little bit faster but if they do get a little bit hard on you then I still really are great if you use them for something like French onion soup or bruschetta or even just a French chest so I hope you make these I hope you like them and I'll see you next time", "UcB0ee7VO-s": "[Music] valentine's Day is just right around the corner [Music] you can make heart-shaped cake without fancy cake pan I'll show you how in this video [Music]

instead of the instant coffee here now it is important to add the vinegar last at this step [Music] and all those baubles that's what we want for this cake [Music] now add the flour in thirds and try not to over mix it [Music] you can see the batter is very liquidy or running and that's fine for this cake and also note the color of the batter it is just a perfect color right [Music] [Music] so while the cake is baking let's make the frosting [Music] now this cream cheese frosting is a lot more soft with the addition of the whipping cream [Music] [Music] [Music] it's great for piping designs onto your cake if that's what you want then go ahead and chill it for later use now as always if you're new to baking and your rice cooker here are some great tips plus you can watch my how to bake a box cake in the rice cooker video and there's more detail in that video I'll put the link in the upper right corner and at the end of this video [Music] [Music] since the batter was pretty runny it took two hours to bake this cake believe me it was worth it now after baking my cake turned this dark brownish red like a burgundy red it's not as bright as before and that's because of the acidic reaction of the cocoa powder and coffee so if you want to be red or cake then use less cocoa powder and less coffee now to shape our cake first create a straight line right in the middle of the cake on one end cut a v-shape and hey it's pac-man I guess I'm dating myself here so let's move on then use a straightedge to guide cutting the sides with the hardpoint ending at the other end of that straight line from the middle and it does not need to be perfect just do your best save those cut out pieces we'll need it later don't eat it and voila heart-shaped cake does it pass now frost your cake and you know how bad I am at this part so you only get a snippet of it and tada frost a cake not bad eh now shred the cuddle pieces into small bits just use your hand I'm going to stick the bits on the side but you can top the cake with it if you like decorate however you want [Music] beautiful isn't it and you can pipe designs with the frost be on top or write something on it if you enjoy

your loved one this Valentine's Day the cake is a too sweet tooth's scale while the frosting is at a three sweet tooth scale [Music] if you didn't get enough of deliciousness and check out my other

delicious supper in less than 45 minutes jerk rubbed catfish with spicy cilantro slaw is a quick and easy weeknight meal the entire recipe takes around 15 minutes and uses a budget-friendly ingredient catfish now I'd like to sprinkle it with Jamaican jerk seasoning this brings in all of the flavors of the Caribbean like allspice and clove cinnamon Chile's it's a versatile ingredient just rub the seasoning into the fish to incorporate the flavors and then cook the fish for about 3 minutes on each side in a hot pan hear that sizzle you know the pans hot and it's searing in all of the flavors Wow these look perfect you can tell from the beautiful golden brown color I have just a few more minutes left to cook so while that finishes I'll make my slaw using pre chopped cabbage and carrots coleslaw mixture to help save time just add mayonnaise some cilantro lime juice some sugar to sweeten up the flavor and then a habanero pepper hop in here is one of the spicier peppers so if you want a little bit more of a mild flavor feel free to use a serrano or even a bell pepper but if you want to crank up that heat leave in the habanero pepper seeds alright the slaw is ready the fish is done it's time to eat what a pretty presentation this meal is so light and fresh just give it a squeeze of lemon juice to help brighten the flavor what I love is it only has around 250 calories serve it

russia okay i believe and as well has a lot of proving involved in this preparation so if you are kind in a hurry i would not recommend this bread okay but don't worry that this proving is going to develop so much better the flavor okay so if you like bread if you like chocolate then you will love this recipe [Music] these are the basic ingredients flour salt yeast water [Music] sugar two full eggs [Music] and of course butter this is basically a brioche dough so it's basically awesome pour the yeast into the water and mix it remember that the water has to be lukewarm this is going to activate the yeast so you get a really fluffy vodka [Music] now you are going to mix the flour the sugar and salt remember that the amounts are going to be in the description below mix this really well with this plumer with your hands and after that we are going to add the two full eggs [Music] cook the mix between the yeast and the [Music] water now using your hands knead this for a little while until it's in shape of a dough you got to make sure that there is no remaining flour now flower the work surface and put the dough in it my at this point we are going to add the butter okay this is going to be a little bit hard and if you want and if you have a stand mixer it's going to be really easier in this way but i'm going to do is by hand where this step is super important that the butter has to be at room temperature otherwise it's going to be impossible to knit these in a proper way if you're doing this by hand don't worry do not stress you have to add the butter little by little until everything is incorporated it's going to be messy it's going to be sticky though so don't worry put some music cheat a little bit and do this at your time you see that always super sticky to handle don't worry flour it a little bit and keep knitting at the end you're going to have a super soft dough oil a bowl a little bit and put the dough in it so it doesn't dry this is the point where we are going to proof the dough in the fridge remember that you have to cover this with a plastic wrap now it's time to make the fudgy filling put the butter into the pot [Music] add the chocolate finely chopped you have to put as well the powdered sugar and the cocoa powder this will create the perfect filling for the vapka [Music] and then always finally ready to be stretched flour the work surface put the dough in it and stretch it with the rotting pin [Music] [Music] once the dough is fully stretched you are going to spread the filling on top of the dough using nothing more but a rubber spatula now it's time to wet the edges of the dough so the dough will stick together and we'll keep or contain the filling [Music] start rolling the dough making a little bit of pressure in the edges [Music] grab a really sharp knife and start cutting in half this gigantic roll do this but not all the way to the end once you're done thrust or twist each of the parts of the dough into each other just exactly as i'm doing right now [Music] at the end make some pressure into the edges [Music] pass the vapka into a previously pre-oiled and pre-floured bread pan let it proof for about two hours in a pot with the same amount of water and sugar and warm it up a little bit [Music] once the baptize ready brush it a little bit with the previous mix [Music] so [Music] you", "4wGb1qCjpFc": "Welcome to keto meals and recipes dot com. Today,\u00a0\nI'm sharing with you one of my husband's favorite\u00a0\u00a0 cookies, my chocolate mocha shortbread cookies.\u00a0\nAs with all of my recipes, if you're new to my\u00a0\u00a0 channel you may not know but all of my recipes are\u00a0\nsugar-free, gluten-free and, of course, keto. I'd also\u00a0\u00a0 like to say that these chocolate shortbread\u00a0\ncookies are not the same as my traditional\u00a0\u00a0 Scottish shortbread. The recipe;s a bit different.\u00a0\nSo, if you want a more classic recipe, please check\u00a0\u00a0 that one out. One of the things that I really like\u00a0\nabout this recipe is that they're a great prep\u00a0\u00a0 ahead recipe, which you can make the dough and\u00a0\nfreeze well ahead of time, so that you have them\u00a0\u00a0 handy anytime that you have a craving, or when you\u00a0\nwant to serve a treat to your family or friends. i also would like to ask that you watch all the\u00a0\nway through the video, right to the end  because\u00a0\u00a0 i will explain two different methods of how to\u00a0\nmake these cookies, as well two different ways of\u00a0\u00a0 freezing and then thawing your cookies as a prep\u00a0\nahead recipe. If you're a chocolate lover, you're\u00a0\u00a0 going to absolutely love these chocolate mocha\u00a0\nshortbread cookies because they have a really\u00a0\u00a0 rich, amazing, chocolate flavor and these are not\u00a0\na super sweet cookie. It's more of a semi-sweet\u00a0\u00a0 and dark chocolate flavor. In order that you can\u00a0\ndecide how many cookies you can enjoy, here are\u00a0\u00a0 the macronutrient ratio for the chocolate mocha\u00a0\nshortbread cookies, which is 4.8 to 1, with 2.4\u00a0\u00a0 grams of total carbs, 1.5 grams of dietary fiber,\u00a0\nresulting in 0.9 grams of net carbs per cookie.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, I usually tell you to preheat\u00a0\nthe oven, but don't do that just yet because\u00a0\u00a0 you have to pre-chill these cookies, and you'll\u00a0\nbe wasting your energy if you preheated now.\u00a0\u00a0 But, when it's time to preheat, set your oven to\u00a0\n350 degrees Fahrenheit or 175 degrees Celsius.\u00a0\u00a0 The first method of making these cookies is\u00a0\nthe easiest. It's to make cookie wedges. And, for\u00a0\u00a0 the wedges, you should also prep ahead by also\u00a0\ngreasing the sides and bottom of the flan pan,\u00a0\u00a0 and also putting a piece of parchment on the\u00a0\nbottom of this pan. And then, just set the pan aside. To make the cookie dough, begin by putting the\u00a0\nbutter into your mixing bowl. If you're using a\u00a0\u00a0 stand mixer, as I am, use your paddle attachment\u00a0\nand whip the butter to a pale yellow stage.\u00a0\u00a0 Add your confectionery sweetener and whip at low\u00a0\nspeed until it's well combined. Because butter\u00a0\u00a0 likes to stick to the sides of the pan, make sure\u00a0\nthat you stop and scrape the bowl once in a while.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, place a fine mesh sieve over your mixing\u00a0\nbowl and add the almond flour, the lupin flour,\u00a0\u00a0 or you can substitute with coconut flour, the dutch\u00a0\nprocess cocoa powder, and a good quality instant\u00a0\u00a0 espresso or strong coffee. And, of course, your\u00a0\nfinely ground salt, the glucomannan, which is also\u00a0\u00a0 known as konjac root powder, then stir all these\u00a0\ningredients to help it pass through the sieve.\u00a0\u00a0 I find that using my hands often works the best,\u00a0\nbut you can also use a spatula. Then, using your\u00a0\u00a0 paddle, mix again at low speed until everything\u00a0\nis well combined. And, don't forget to scrape\u00a0\u00a0 down the sides and the bottom of your bowl, so\u00a0\nthat all the ingredients are well integrated.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, you have two options on how to make\u00a0\nthe cookies. For option one, which is the wedges,\u00a0\u00a0 get your prepared pan and transfer the cookie\u00a0\ndough into it. Then, with your offset spatula,\u00a0\u00a0 spread out the cookie dough so that it's even\u00a0\nand the same thickness all the way throughout.\u00a0\u00a0 And, lastly, smooth the surface. This, of course,\u00a0\nis the easiest method. I'd also like to mention\u00a0\u00a0 that, regardless whether you're using option\u00a0\none, the wedges, or the option two, which is the\u00a0\u00a0 cookie cutouts, to make these cookies place them\u00a0\ninto the middle position of your preheated oven,\u00a0\u00a0 and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Now, to continue with\u00a0\nthe wedges. When the cookies are done, remove the\u00a0\u00a0 pan from the oven. While the cookies are still\u00a0\nwarm, cut them into wedges, as I'm showing here.\u00a0\u00a0 Try your best to make each of\u00a0\nthe wedges about the same size.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, let everything cool in the pan\u00a0\nuntil the cookies are at room temperature.\u00a0\u00a0 You can serve the wedges as is, but I like to\u00a0\nfinish the wedges by taking my small sieve and\u00a0\u00a0 use the sweetener I ground to confectioner powder.\u00a0\nAnd, just lightly dust the surface of the cookies.\u00a0\u00a0 Because this pan has a lift bottom and,\u00a0\nif you use the pan like mine that has\u00a0\u00a0 a movable bottom, just lift the cookies out of\u00a0\nthe pan. And, I like to re-cut my cookies just\u00a0\u00a0 to make sure that they'll come apart nicely. And\u00a0\nthen, all you have to do is serve and plate them and, of course, enjoy. Now, for option two, in\u00a0\nwhich I'm going to use my cookie cutout shapes.\u00a0\u00a0 The first step for this method is to\u00a0\ntransfer the dough onto a sheet of cling wrap.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, flatten the dough a bit by using\u00a0\na rolling pin to get it nice and even.\u00a0\u00a0 I do this because the flatter dough will\u00a0\nchill faster and it will make the next step\u00a0\u00a0 much easier. Then, use the cling wrap to seal it. Put\u00a0\nit onto a tray and refrigerate for about two hours.\u00a0\u00a0 You want the dough really nice and cold because\u00a0\nthis will puff up and expand too much if it's\u00a0\u00a0 not chilled properly. When you know that your dough\u00a0\nis nice and chilled, remove it from the fridge and\u00a0\u00a0 place between two sheets of parchment. Or, as I'm\u00a0\ndoing, use your cling wrap and again, using your\u00a0\u00a0 rolling pin, roll out the cookie dough a bit more\u00a0\nso that the dough is a little bit less wide than\u00a0\u00a0 your rolling pin. Now, here's a technique that I\u00a0\nlike when I'm making cut out cookies. And, if you've\u00a0\u00a0 watched my sugar cookie video, you'll be familiar\u00a0\nwith this, because in the sugar cookie video I\u00a0\u00a0 demonstrate the idea of using either painter\u00a0\nsticks or chopsticks as guides to ensure that\u00a0\u00a0 when I'm rolling out the dough, it becomes a nice\u00a0\neven thickness. Because, an even thickness for all\u00a0\u00a0 of your cookies is really important so that they\u00a0\nall bake at about the same rate. Now, just use your\u00a0\u00a0 rolling pin to even out the thickness to about one\u00a0\nquarter inch or about one half centimeter thick.\u00a0\u00a0 You should work fairly quickly at this stage\u00a0\nbecause you want your cookie dough to remain\u00a0\u00a0 cold. Now, use the cookie cutout of your choice.\u00a0\nIn today's video, I'll be making heart shapes.\u00a0\u00a0 And, press out the cookie shapes. While you're\u00a0\nmaking the cookie cutouts, try to place them as\u00a0\u00a0 close to each other as possible. Having done that,\u00a0\nwhen you're ready to transfer the shapes onto\u00a0\u00a0 your parchment lined cookie sheet, begin by first\u00a0\nremoving the scrap dough that's around the closest\u00a0\u00a0 cutout. That makes it much easier to remove the\u00a0\ncookie shape, which you can do by using a spatula\u00a0\u00a0 or a knife or, as I'm doing, by carefully using\u00a0\nmy hands to peel and remove each cutter from the\u00a0\u00a0 parchment. And, just repeat until you've done all of\u00a0\nthat. All your scrap cookie dough can be re-rolled,\u00a0\u00a0 flattened, chilled again, and then used to make more\u00a0\ncutouts. And, now that I have transferred the cutout\u00a0\u00a0 shapes onto my parchment-lined cooking sheet, as\u00a0\nyou can see my tray is quite full, I'm going to put\u00a0\u00a0 the entire tray into the refrigerator for a couple\u00a0\nhours. This second chill is really important when\u00a0\u00a0 you're making cutouts and making sugar cookies\u00a0\nor butter cookies of any kind. And, chilling is\u00a0\u00a0 extremely important with this particular recipe of\u00a0\nchocolate mocha shortbread cookies, because it has\u00a0\u00a0 so much butter and, if you don't chill them really\u00a0\nwell, your cookies will expand when you're baking,\u00a0\u00a0 and they'll lose their shape. This is one of the\u00a0\nbig differences between option one and option two.\u00a0\u00a0 You don't have to chill the dough when you're\u00a0\nmaking wedges, but you do have to chill when\u00a0\u00a0 you're using cutouts. And, about 10 minutes before\u00a0\nyou're ready to bake, preheat your oven. When your\u00a0\u00a0 cookie dough is very chilled, place the sheet of\u00a0\ncookies into the middle position of your oven\u00a0\u00a0 and bake for about 10 minutes. And then, remove the\u00a0\ntray from the oven. I forgot to mention that, once\u00a0\u00a0 you've taken your tray out of the oven, let the\u00a0\ncookies cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. And\u00a0\u00a0 then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool to room\u00a0\ntemperature. These cookie cutouts can be served as\u00a0\u00a0 is, and they are delicious. However, if you'd like\u00a0\nto decorate them for a special occasion, or just\u00a0\u00a0 because you like them that way, here are two simple\u00a0\nways. To avoid any misinterpretation of my recipe,\u00a0\u00a0 I'd like to mention that I did not include the\u00a0\nextra sweetener or the chocolate dip in my macro\u00a0\u00a0 calculation. As I've mentioned, for my wedges, the\u00a0\nsimplest way to decorate the cookies is to use\u00a0\u00a0 your sweetener, which you ground to confectionery\u00a0\npowder. Alternatively, another way, that my husband\u00a0\u00a0 really likes his cookies, is to have them chocolate\u00a0\ndipped. Making the chocolate dip is really easy. All\u00a0\u00a0 you have to do is get your unsweetened chocolate,\u00a0\nand a bit of butter. And, I know there's a lot of\u00a0\u00a0 different ganache recipes, but I have found that\u00a0\nusing two parts chocolate to one part butter\u00a0\u00a0 works really well. And, as I said, I'm not adding\u00a0\nany sweetener to this chocolate because I want\u00a0\u00a0 that rich, dark chocolate flavor to complement the\u00a0\ncookie. But, if you find that the dipping chocolate\u00a0\u00a0 is too bitter for you, just add a little bit\u00a0\nof sweetener. And, the time to dip these cookies\u00a0\u00a0 is when they're completely cooled and at room\u00a0\ntemperature. To make them look a little bit fancier,\u00a0\u00a0 and more of a bakery sort of look, I'd suggest you\u00a0\nonly dip about half of your cookie. I have to admit\u00a0\u00a0 i do like the way they look with this half and\u00a0\nhalf method. And, the last little tip on decorating,\u00a0\u00a0 especially for occasions like Christmas, New Year's\u00a0\nor Valentine's, birthday, whatever, is if you have\u00a0\u00a0 gold sprinkles or silver sprinkles, use them at\u00a0\nthis point to sprinkle them on the wet chocolate.\u00a0\u00a0 By dusting with the sprinkles on the wet chocolate,\u00a0\nthey will stick really well. And, the last thing I'd\u00a0\u00a0 like to explain is how to store these chocolate\u00a0\nshortbread cookies. To store the chocolate mocha\u00a0\u00a0 shortbread cookies, place them in a container and\u00a0\nkeep them in your fridge. And, they'll stay there\u00a0\u00a0 very nicely for several days. Alternatively, there\u00a0\nare two ways you can freeze them for prep ahead.\u00a0\u00a0 First, make the cookie dough, wrap it really well\u00a0\nin cling wrap, roll it into a log, then place this\u00a0\u00a0 log of dough, and then place it into a freezer\u00a0\nbag. And, of course, label it. Or, alternatively,\u00a0\u00a0 you can prepare the cookie dough, roll it out\u00a0\nand cut out the shapes, as I did in option two,\u00a0\u00a0 and place these shapes into an airtight, freezer\u00a0\nsafe container. By freezing the cookie dough, this\u00a0\u00a0 will last for several months. To thaw my cookie\u00a0\ndough, I place the frozen dough into my fridge\u00a0\u00a0 and leave it to thaw slowly overnight. And,\u00a0\nafter you have baked your prep ahead cookies,\u00a0\u00a0 you can decorate them by dusting them with\u00a0\nthe confectioner powder or dipping them\u00a0\u00a0 into chocolate. After baking and the cookies are\u00a0\ncooled and decorated as you choose, place them on\u00a0\u00a0 a platter and they're ready to serve. I hope that\u00a0\nyou have found this recipe and explanation useful.\u00a0\u00a0 If you have, and you haven't done so already, I\u00a0\nwould be really honored if you would subscribe,\u00a0\u00a0 turn on your notification bell, give me a like,\u00a0\nand share this recipe with someone that you think\u00a0\u00a0 might also like this recipe.

Until next time, cheers!", "4xa1B5oRmBQ": "hi everyone welcome to best recipes with Sharon I'm excited to bring this recipe to you for Nova Scotia of blueberry bagels and yes the blueberries in this recipe came all the way from Nova Scotia so Lisa this one's for you now let me show you how these bagels are made now you can use fresh blueberries or frozen blueberries either one the ones I used today were frozen so this is completely homemade bagel dough let's get started so place one and a quarter cups of warm water and a mixing bowl then add two tablespoons of sugar [Music] then add two and a half teaspoons of quick rising yeast and set that aside to dissolve and soften these are wonderful plump blueberries but I'm gonna chop them into smaller pieces just to use it for the bagel recipe and by doing this I'll have it more evenly distributed throughout the dough and we'll need about one cup of the chopped blueberries and these blueberries will be placed in a small bowl and then dusted with a quarter cup of flour and I mix them with my hand not to break them up any more than I can help coating them with flour helps to keep them from bleeding into the dole then take another medium sized mixing bowl and add three and a quarter cups of flour and one and a half teaspoons of salt for that then take a small spoon and just mix the flour and salt until they're combined now take the flour and salt mixture and pour it into a larger mixing bowl to start with and then make it well in the center like this now pour in your softened yeast mixture and I take the large spoon and then I mix it together like this until the dough starts to cling together and your dough should be a little bit sticky at this point now then turn it out onto a floured surface and I just needed enough to hold it together and it should still be sticky so that you can add your blueberries and they will stick to the dough better and you can get it mixed in better now I add the blueberries about 1/2 cup at a time and those blueberries are coated with flour so go ahead and knead it aggressively so that you can get it mixed in well you want those blueberries evenly distributed throughout the dough and as you're kneading the dough you'll need to dust it with flour here and there and only add enough flour so that it forms a soft dough there now it looks like it's got a good texture and the blueberries are evenly distributed so now we'll set it aside in a mixing bowl cover it with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour and a half then I place some parchment paper on a cookie now boil some water in a large saucepan and the dough has rose to almost double about an hour and a half's worth of rising so then I'm turning it out onto a floured surface again and then cut it into individual portions to make each individual bagel whip about ten or eleven pieces or whatever size you want your bagels to be now we're not going to be rolling these out we're going to be taking each individual piece shaping them with your hands and using your thumb in the middle to make the hole you don't want to handle the dough any more than you have to at this point since most of the proofing has been done in the first hour and a half now the second rising or proofing is only thirty minutes and while these are rising pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and make sure your pot of boiling water is ready to go so now then we're going to boil the bagels by placing three or four of them in the pot at the same time I boil each bagel for a minute and a half and then I flip it over and boil it for another minute and a half on the other side you can boil it longer if you want it more chewy but I find a minute and a half on each side as a boat perfect then I scoop them out of the hot water like this drain them off and place them on the parchment paper on the cookie sheet [Music] then you take them and place them in the oven at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes now that 20 minutes is up I'm removing them from the oven and they're perfectly browned and they're slightly golden underneath as well so there you have it blueberry bagels your own homemade recipe that you can make up within a fairly short amount of time and once again that homemade flavor you just can't be what do you think they look really good don't they go ahead and try it you'll be amazed I love to cut them in half and toast them they also freeze really well [Music]", "ZWUuBIHIp7A": "[Music] today we are going to be making scallion buns these are one of my absolute favorite taiwanese bakery breads today we're not just making any normal scallion buns because that's boring today we're gonna be making sourdough scallion buns this bread is 100 leavened with natural yeast with your sourdough starter there is no commercial yeast in this so if you have any leftover sourdough starter that has just been sitting in the back of your fridge for a few months it's time to break it out and also time to make use of your windowsill spring onions that you've been sprouting for this recipe it's important that you have active fed sourdough starter so you can see this starter is bubbly this is really important because our sourdough starter is the only leavening agent in this recipe if you have starter in your refrigerator it might look a little something like this with a layer of liquid on top and you can see the side by side you want to use starter that looks like the one on the right [Music] in a mixing bowl combine 150 grams of bread flour with 25 grams of all-purpose flour 9.5 grams of granulated sugar 1.5 grams of salt and 100 grams of active sourdough starter next we're going to measure out 40 ml of almond milk i'm using almond milk but you can use whatever milk you have and 20 grams of unsalted butter and 1 egg [Music] begin mixing your dough in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment and gradually add in your milk [Music] once all the ingredients look evenly combined we're going to add in our 20 grams of softened unsalted butter and then just continue mixing again until it's evenly combined and the dough is not sticking as much to the edge of the bowl [Applause] [Music] now that the machine has given us a bit of a head start we can take the dough onto the counter and continue kneading by hand i'm using this slap and fold method where you just take a corner of the dough slap it onto your counter and then fold it in half and this motion is just going to help develop the gluten in the dough [Music] you can continually perform a windowpane test which is where you take a piece of the dough and stretch it out thinly to see if you can see light through it as you can see my dough broke really easily which means that it's not strong enough and the gluten hasn't been developed enough so just continue kneading until it looks like this where your dough can stretch out to be really thin and you can see light through it and it doesn't break as easily shape the dough into a ball and put it into a mixing bowl cover it and we're gonna let it rise for about two hours [Music] once the dough has been proofed we can take it out and divide it into six equal portions which will be about 66 grams each [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay next we're going to shape the buns basically you want to take a piece of dough and roll it out flat until it's this oval shape [Music] starting from the top of the oval you want to roll inwards on itself and kind of pinch or press down with each roll so that the bun is tightly rolled just pinch the seams closed and also pinch the ends and you'll end up with this like round rolled shape with tapered ends [Music] basically [Music] all right next it's time to break out your giant scary cleaver that every asian kitchen has and we're going to score these buns um for real though i don't recommend using such a large cleaver for this part i'm just using this because it's the sharpest knife we have in our kitchen you basically just need a sharp blade ideally a razor blade would work great because it's small and honestly using this cleaver was a little bit terrifying and i was scared that i was going to cut my fingers off so place each bun onto the baking sheet evenly spaced and then you're going to hold the sides of the bun with one hand and then use the cleaver or whatever knife you're using to make a deep slash across the middle of the bun you want to make sure that you cut deep enough because this will help the buns open up nicely in their second proof the buns have been scored we are going to put it into the oven non-preheated oven i repeat the oven should not be turned on for this part just put it into the oven and let it proof for another two hours towards the end of your proof time you can take the buns out of the oven and then preheat your oven to 190 degrees celsius or 375 degrees fahrenheit and then we can make our scallion mixture which is going to use white pepper salt 1 egg 15 grams of olive oil or any neutral flavored oil and 50 grams of scallions [Music] place them into a bowl and then add in all the other ingredients and mix until evenly combined [Music] because of the cut we made earlier the buns have a nice flat top for the scallion mixer to rest on so just top each bun with a big spoonful of the scallion mixture and if they fall off it's okay just try and keep them on top and then you can also kind of brush the leftover egg oil mixture around the sides of the bun which will give it a nice sheen as it bakes up in the oven so now we can bake the buns at 375 degrees for about 15 to 16 minutes or until they look golden brown and [Music] beautiful and these are the finished buttons i'm so happy with how they turned out the outside got really nice and crispy while the inside is really soft and fluffy as you can see my family literally pounced on them as soon as they were out of the oven it smells super fragrant because of the scallions and they are just the perfect size for carrying out on a picnic or for breakfast they were just absolutely delicious and i highly recommend that you make them if your family hasn't eaten them all within seconds of taking them out of the oven you can take them out and put them on a wire rack to cool i will note that if you are going for a more traditional taiwanese bread flavor i would recommend increasing the sugar and also in order to get that nice glistening glow of a lot of buns that you see at the bakery you can brush melted butter on top of the buns as soon as they come out of the oven [Music] i'm going to talk a little bit about how exactly i converted this recipe to incorporate sourdough starter which is something that i started doing a lot about mid quarantine like probably may because i ran out of my instant and active dry yeast and the great thing is that sourdough starter is so versatile you can use it for so many other things other than just traditional sourdough bread you can basically substitute it in any single recipe that calls for commercial yeast you just have to make sure to convert the recipe accordingly so this recipe started off with 200 grams of high gluten flour or bread flour and it calls for 90 mls of milk so whenever you look at a recipe you want to first look at the flour and the liquid content because sourdough starter is flour and water you're also going to want to look at the amount of yeast that the recipe uses so the original recipe only called for 1.5 grams of instant yeast which is not a whole lot so i decided i would incorporate 100 grams of my sourdough starter in here keep in mind my starter is 100 hydration which means that it's equal parts flour and water if your sourdough starter is not equal parts flour in water for example if it's a lower hydration you're going to want to adjust accordingly i hope this makes sense so since i'm using 100 grams of sourdough starter that means that in my starter there's 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water that means that i'm going to subtract 50 grams of flour from the original recipe and 50 grams of liquid from my original recipe that is how i ended up with 150 grams of bread flour and 40 mils of milk instead of the original 290. every time you convert a recipe from using commercial yeast to sourdough starter you're going to have to account for extra time for the bread to rise because sourdough starter just doesn't work as fast as commercial yeast so when you look at the recipe and it says how long you should let your bread proof for you're probably going to want to double those times just to be safe and that's just important to note for when you are about to attempt the recipe so you know how long it's going to take you again i'm not an expert on this at all i only just started doing this a couple months ago and this is probably not like a super accurate scientific way of doing it this is just the way that i've done it and it has worked for me alright i hope you enjoyed going on this baking adventure with me today i had a great time these breads are so delicious [Music] you", "qYG9Mx0NIV8": "thanksgiving is right around the corner\nthis

medium sized loafs country bread is not hard to make\nat all but keep in mind that you do have to start the process the night before\nall you have to do the night before thanksgiving is quickly mix\nall the ingredients for the pre-ferment which we'll have to make and then let it\nsit 12 to 16 hours covered on the room\ntemperature and the process takes less than 5\nminutes and then the next day about 12 to 16\nhours later you can come back to your preferment and\nstart making the thanksgiving country loaf\nthe process from that point on will take about three to four hours but it will\ngive you big breaks in between the steps you need to do\nwhich will be perfect to allow you to prepare a thanksgiving meal or just\nsimply relax if you like this video hit the like\nbutton or subscribe if you have any questions or comments please post them\nbelow we will start our preferment with 300\nmilliliters of lukewarm water in which we will disperse 1 8 of a\nteaspoon of yeast let it sit three to four minutes to help\nyeast dissolve and then add 500 grams of flour followed\nby one and a half teaspoons of salt mix everything together until all the\ningredients are fully incorporated you will find that the pre-ferment is\nvery stiff which is perfectly fine because this\ndough has only sixty percent hydration however if you find the pre-ferment hard\nto work with you can just add a couple of drops\nof water at a time until you achieve this consistency\ncover the bowl with a plastic wrap and a towel and let it sit anywhere between 12\nto 16 hours in a warm non-drafty place where the\ntemperature is about 21 celsius or 70 fahrenheit\nwhich is a pretty standard room temperature but if you find that your\nplace is a little bit cooler add a couple of more towels around the bowl okay so the 16 hours has passed and now\nwe're gonna get to start making the country bread loaf\nwe will need 380 milliliters of lukewarm water\nhalf a teaspoon of yeast that we will let dissolve for about three to four\nminutes and then we will add 500 grams of flour\nfollowed by one and a half teaspoons of salt\nwe're gonna mix everything well and lightly knead the dough next we will add our pre-ferment this here to the left is our dough and\nto the right is the pre-ferment tear the chunks of pre-ferment and\nlittle by little add them to the dough incorporate the pre-ferment by placing\nit in the middle of the dough and pulling the edges over it\ncontinue adding the rest of the preferment pieces until it's all\nincorporated which would take about 5 minutes\nthe same process will apply if you're making this using your stand mixer\nuse the first speed as you're adding the preferment pieces and the second speed\nafter everything is incorporated for about two to three minutes cover it with plastic foil and a towel\nand let it rest 50 minutes\nafter the first 50 minutes has passed we will now fold the dough\nfolding is a very important technique used to degas\nthe dough and equalize its temperature wet your hands very lightly as to not\nbring too much moisture to your dough scoop the dough onto a\nclean board and let's get started with the folding\nat first you will notice that the dough will be tearing and it will be very hard\nto move in one piece don't be afraid of this and don't add\nflour to it imagine that i'm standing in front of\nthe dough i will twist my body slightly to the left and take the dough gently by\nplacing my palms underneath it pulling the dough toward me and then\nslapping it perpendicularly away from me and again grab the dough on your left\npull it over the center of your body and swiftly toss it away from you\nthe more you keep doing this the more the gluten will develop\nand you will notice less and less pieces of the dough\nsticking to the board and now we're gonna let the dough sit\nanother 50 minutes covered with a cellophane wrap and a towel after another 50 minutes has passed we\nwill fold the dough just like the last time now it's going to be sitting for another\n50  minutes before we do something different with it okay now that the last 50 minutes has\npassed we're gonna do something different with the dough\nthis time around we are going to lightly flour the board and cut our dough into\ntwo equal halves make sure to use the scale for this once you weighted the two halves of the\ndough here comes the fun part we will pre-shape our loaves by gently pulling\nthem towards ourselves rotating them and then pulling them in\nagain first time around we will do this only four times\nand we are gonna let it sit for another 15 minutes\none five after 15 minutes has passed we will do\nthe same maneuver again and we will repeat it eight times per\nloaf and here i just wanted to show you how i\nhold my fingers underneath the dough now that we have shaped the dough into\nfinal round loaves we're gonna cover them with a plastic\nfoil and a towel and keep it like that for another hour and a half\nfor final rise so i decided to use that hour and a half to decorate my\nthanksgiving table i opted for a very simple monochromatic\ncolor scheme with beautiful white dishes against the\ndark tablecloth the vintage glassware brought the golden\naccents and dried thyme from my mother's garden\nbrought the green kiss of color and of course one can't be too serious\nso there should always be room for quirky little details\na lot of people give you tips on how to do steaming in your home oven\nbut in order to do it right you have to do this\nin a three-step process and nobody tells you about the third step but me okay step one place several cubes of ice at the bottom of your oven\nas it's being preheated next as part of step two take an empty\nsmall or medium sized roasting pan and place\nit at the very bottom rack of your oven steam is a very dangerous thing so i\nstrongly recommend not only that you have\nbig mitts on your hands but also that you wear long sleeves on your arms\nand make sure your face is away from the oven as you're doing this next step so now carefully pull the bottom rack\nout and pour cold tap water in the roasting\npan and then quickly close the oven door in order to trap the steam and now the big secret the step number\nthree that people always miss last 10 minutes of baking slightly open\nthe oven door to let the steam out and that's it this step is the key to\nensuring that your crust is crispy and crackly and thin\ninstead of thick and gummy and now we get to do a fun design with scoring the\nbread surface if you don't have a \"lame\" or a different\nsharp blade you can easily use scissors to create a pattern\ni recommend against using a knife no matter how sharp it is because 9 out of\n10 times you will squish the dough loaf instead of tearing through it like \"lame\"\nscissors usually work better let the dough rest for a casual 10\nminutes or less while the oven is being preheated\nlightly flour the pan right in the spot where the bread will be placed\nyour country bread loaf will be baking 20 to 30 minutes depending on your oven and here it is the star of the show with its beautiful thin\ncrispy

important that we're is accurate as possible weighing out the ingredients for this keto bread and then to that food scale we're gonna add a large measuring cup and start adding the dry ingredients the first of which is going to be blanched almond flour however you could also use sunflower seed or walnut flour as well anyways we're gonna add around 3/4 of a cup or 86 grams of the almond flour to our bowl and then when we've got that in there we're gonna add some unflavored protein powder by the way I tried making this keto yeast bread without the protein powder by replacing it with more almond flour and then I tried replacing it with collagen and it was a total fail so don't try to make this bread without it that said we're gonna use 2/3 of a scoop or 22 grams of it for today's keto yeast bread recipe and when that's looking good we're gonna add just a touch of sweetness to the bread without adding any carbs or calories by using 2 teaspoons or six grams of confectioner's swerve then we're going to add a half a teaspoon or 2 grams of baking powder 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum about 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt and then lastly we're gonna add some yeast because of course we are making yeast bread and we're gonna add around a teaspoon or 3 grams of rapid rise yeast to our bowl so that's it for the dry ingredients the only what ingredient we'll need is about a third of a cup or a hundred grams of some warm water so we're just gonna add that to our Bowl and then we're gonna get out our spatula and mix everything together until a thick paste forms in the bowl when it does we're gonna get out a 4 cup square glass dish like this and then we're gonna generously coat it with baking spray now we're gonna add the batter for our keto yeast bread to the dish and evenly spread it out with our spatula when that's looking good we're gonna microwave the bread for about 2 minutes and 30 seconds and then I like to check in on it and make sure that the top is firm and if it isn't totally firm I'll microwave it for 15 seconds at a time until it is then when that's all set we're gonna remove the keto yeast bread with a kitchenette because the dish can get really hot guys and we're gonna let the bread cool down to room temperature also you can bake this keto yeast bread in the oven as well just pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and cook the bread for about 15 minutes really just until the top is firm and golden brown anyways when the bread is done cooking and it's had time to cool we're just gonna flip it upside down and then we're gonna use a thin bread knife to cut it in half then we can use a larger knife to cut it into quarters and then check this out look how perfect these slices of keto yeast bread turn out so I know what you're thinking can i toast this bread and the answer is a hundred percent yes this yeast bread toasts incredibly well so just add it to your toaster like you would any other kind of bread and it will toast up perfectly like this as always for more info on today's low-carb keto bread recipe check out the video description below and I hope you enjoy the bread", "1hFv_1JE_j0": "and then one press will hear the fat lady sing no Reeko I know what Oh what's going on everybody welcome back to the high channel yeah Kyle here yeah Rory and today we're just gonna be burning a pre-roll that we received from what is it the gold star I don't know the expecting star organic collective I believe okay that's that's gold star organic Ramon they are in a thousand palms off a Ramon just like you know it's the exit off mic on Monterey take a left on a Ramona nothing like the interstate and you'd be good yeah plenty of parking there the guy at the front desk was really nice we have even had like a little like snacks and stuff really eaten the like waiting room different like you know fruits and like animal crackers and different snacks and cheese's in general that would have been cool but apparently I was just trying to rush and get to the no I don't know yeah like I didn't stop and even II like it was I got in there too quick to where I didn't have to win but I definitely saw that it was available for everyone I just walked in I was like we used to do nude you see it but uh go ahead and like this join up and smoke this for you guys it's basically just Anna I think he said was I gonna mix it whatever they're you know getting lolling so believe it has them some Jack and some random way nobody's in there oh yeah it's tired of [ __ ] yeah some people saying that joint so they prefer tightness on showing over looseness on anything else I prefer to rather okay just if it's loose it it's softer it's super tight I don't want to be like constricted trying to get some like smoke through it who'd be the Blowfish over here I feel like you might be a little who used on this one love it the hooters oh yeah they have a you know nice deals for you believe it was over by a top shelf eight you could get a gram and then they also have a you know your first time patient pre-rolls but you have the I believe the bio top shelf eighth and get a gram is other happy hour and that's from 420 to five o'clock I believe that's all week daddy so that's a happy forty minutes not quite happy at work yeah definitely tastes like there's there's a bunch of different stuff in there but grab some some Blue Dream from Gold Star that you guys will probably be seeing here in the next episode or two and pretty excited about that just figured I'd burn this pre-roll with Roy before we got to the really good stuff definitely a little tight yeah super tight that's okay at least that means who's gonna buy us though yeah the the note selection could have been a little bit better in there the Ecostar I would use the word slim pickins yeah like but it is you know the end of the week and you know who knows when they're gonna be picking some more stuff up but yeah they probably roughly have around five to seven top-shelf nugs I believe and then maybe like roughly five to seven like you know bottom shelf nose and that's it so I believe it was like some some fifty dollar days and then they had some thing $35 days yeah definitely the cap cap was fifty right they were they didn't have any 55 or 60 note and Daniel the guy that was the bud tender he was pretty cool like I know you were talking to him for a minute yeah definitely friendly service they have a selection of edibles and clones and your notes and then a little glass selection beef jerky yeah I hadn't seen that and different kind of edibles besides like you know your ice creams and your like cereal mixes and some chocolates and stuff but definitely even had some beef jerky it looks scary like not scary intoxicating but scary ingesting beef that looks like that could be the best thing ever that we don't know never know I have not tried it they're definitely gonna be grabbing some ice cream before some beef jerky yeah sure but this was a different episode and get lost I guess that's a good thing on the pre-rolls part right all right yeah I like the fact that you know they gave me the pre-roll in this little do too you know I'd rather not get a pre-roll in a bag or like a cardboard prepackaged deal you know what I mean like one of those medic owns or something like that definitely nice to just like go and if I need you know to put a Jenny in something for the road or something like that yeah even if you have some like some small popcorn no get to that or anything you know you could probably fit a gram of like something they're easy as long as they're small nodes little popcorn babies yeah this is some different stuff for a different episode more quality medications all around there that even grabbed like the high hit glass rod from a gold star a nice little glass wand five bucks you know they had a couple different sizes but basically you know ranging from foot foot sizes be a nice thick glass looks like it's pretty you know stout yeah it's gonna be or at least it should be hard to break that one yeah it's not the wand that's basically like the super-sized a bird think this is a wand like Harry Potter style yeah we will definitely treat us okay it could be worse that's for sure I know that yeah definitely guess that was off like the lower shelf mix but still uh still nice and execute you know you can't complain all right there just thought I wanted at you yeah definitely free and you know I guess you get your medicated depending on the person why not you know you should like medicated to what you were trying to get medicated yeah I feel like we'll probably be part of one or something after this a little bit yeah those you know got right in a gold star there's my first time you know both of our first times going there got right in verified here does like you know a minute and uh yeah definitely in and out of experience you know a lot of people like that you know but me I feel like me and this guy could live at a dispensary basically just smell those smells everyday but you know you put us in a warehouse full and ugh and we're gonna investigate every smell taste and sight picture of everything just love everything about it you just like smell them like aromatherapy like I do just keep smelling nice local my smell I'm good for now I'm good nah man well let me get to be more smell trickling down what are backups smell smell pass you know what I mean man that's a shame and I quit smelling yesterday and I'd be all over smelling that but but I'm busy smoking something right now I'm not too busy just a second there we go Hey yeah this pre-roll is definitely tired as hell though it's trying to keep the smoke so I try to give it to you you gotta take it's about reality still going through oh yeah so if you ever in the area of basically in Thousand Palms you head up to Gold Star organic you know collective and they have you know medications and edibles and everything you basically want definitely go check it out it's you know pretty you know for sure the fifty dollar cap on the the top shelf is decent you know what I'm saying then you know you know $35 eight you know $35 AC we go down to $65 quarters so if you're on a budget they definitely have some medication for you you know and like the you know for 35 an eighth you know it wasn't looking that horrible you know definitely if you're looking to some top-shelf you wouldn't want to buy that stuff but you know if you're a baller on a budget I would definitely say hit up gold star good prices the $50.00 cap on on the top shelf you know free pre-roll first time patient and yeah that was the free grandma like on the a 30-hour yeah free gram as a first time patient if you buy an eighth and then if you buy an eighth is that during happy hour no I'm saying like yeah like I forget like a donation like with first time donation you get a pre-roll and then the first time you know like if you're not first time but sorry if you just basic own happy out from 420 to five o'clock and you buy a top shelf eighth you get a free grant that's off the lower show yeah yeah definitely got hooked up a little bit we got top shelf

further than that Oh appreciate that Daniel yeah it's been higher channel I'm calm mrs. Rory peace out guys peace peace you", "20K2O_kO0ks": "hey everyone brian here again from the wild rift team coming to you from home i brought two friends with me this time orianna and galahad who might chime in during this recording because they really love league of legends so back in june you might have seen the limited regional alpha where a few thousand players helped us write check our core gameplay our progression systems and begin stress testing our infrastructure overall we're really thrilled with how the alpha went players told us they had a lot of fun that wild rift truly feels like league and we've been continuing to develop the game with players suggestions and feedback in mind if you took part in the alpha thank you your time and commitment means the world to us so next we want to involve more players so we're moving into our first regional closed beta [Music] while we're just going to a few regions this time this one's going to be larger than our alpha test with some bonus features and content on the way you can find more about the regional closed beta by clicking on the link in the description we thought you'd want to know what we've been up to over the last couple of months so here's a new round of updates from across the wildriff team hey everybody i'm ed and i'm a game designer on the around game team on wild rift we know how much competitive experiences mean to league players and many of you pretty much spend all your time in rank queues when you play our objectives for wild riffs rank system are to build a mode that is competitive and fun feels familiar to pc players and is easy to get into for newer ones so today we're going to talk about how it works wild riffs rank system unlocks at level 10. you will be seated into ranked tiers that will look familiar to league fans and climb your way from iron to challenger each tier below master has four divisions we've added emerald a new tier between platinum and diamond so we can distribute players more accurately at the skill levels we adopted two different systems for ranked for iron to emerald rings every game you win grounds you a ranked mark and every loss removes one you'll need to earn up to five ranked marks to climb higher up the ladder with lower tiers requiring fewer marks diamond ranks and above switch to a victory point system which looks a lot like league pc's league point system so players can jockey for those key positions on the ranked leaderboards as you play you'll fill up ranked fortitude this system rewards you when you play well and protects you from the occasional loss fortitude is earned by a variety of sources including skilled play once it's full fortitude is automatically consumed to grant you protection from losing ranked marks when your team takes a loss while we want this system to feel like a safety net to players who have occasional bad games we don't want it to feel like a runaway progress because of this we will impose weekly caps to the fortitude system you can queue with one two three or five players in ranked and the matchmaking system will always match up groups with equal power taking into account the group party makeup in order to provide the fairest matches possible now we know that many of you might have questions about this system and we get it we want wild rift's competitive ecosystem to feel great for those of you that want to show your skills and you may have had other experiences that don't live up to that goal the only way we'll know this system is working is to test it at scale and so far we've only had a pretty small testing pool we have a lot of controls on our side to tune and deliver the most fair and fun competitive experience possible if these systems are unfair and you're not happy we will make changes beyond ranked we also have big plans for other systems around the game so i'm gonna hand it off to christina to talk about our plans for progression monetization and leveling hello it's christina again from the personalization team now a lot of you are probably wondering how do you unlock stuff in wild rift so let's get right into it for the first few levels you'll earn starter champions just by leveling up and as you continue to play you'll also earn blue moats which you can use to get other champions now we are serious about making wild rift free-to-play friendly so we're hoping that you'll have enough ways to play the champions you want through early leveling blue modes and the free champion rotation and we want to double down on our commitment to you that paying for content should always be optional we want wild rift to be a top tier league of legends experience meaning we won't be offering exclusive p champions in-game stat booths or locking champions behind expensive walls so for those of you who can't spend money we have new systems like porocoins you can earn coins as you play and use them to unlock cosmetic items like certain emotes and skins and in terms of monetization our closed beta also introduces wild cores our version of rp you'll be able to purchase champions skins and lots of other goodies throughout the test and sometime after the testing phase we'll be doing a global account reset so all wild core purchases will be returned to you but with a 20 bonus on top as a thank you okay before i hand it off to jane let's just take a quick peek at some of the new content coming to closed beta and let us know what you think we're looking forward to it so hey everyone i'm jane chen and i lead the in-game team we got a lot of great suggestions from alpha testers so we've been responding to feedback and data from the alpha jonathan and the gameplay team have been hard at work addressing feedback around turns feeling too weak we've already made adjustments to turret health and defenses we're keeping an eye on sheen as well as certain split push champions who were a little too effective at demolishing turrets we've also added more advanced control features for players to fine tune their experience there's a new semi-lock camera feature in your settings this adds a button on the screen that lets you adjust the default offset of your camera on the fly use this to give yourself a slightly better view of gank entrances or paint it towards your enemy laner so it's easier to set up long range skill shots speaking of long range skill shots we've added a lot of new features to make it easier to see where you're aiming it can be especially difficult when you're aiming below you the camera now automatically pans the show more on the screen hitting global olds was especially difficult in alpha so now if you're using the mini map to look at a different part of the map global olds will aim from the center of your screen instead of your champion making it a lot easier to aim quickly and precisely and landing those globals didn't always feel satisfying so we've added a pop-up camera to let you savor the moment when you land across that as well [Music] there's a lot more we want to share but we thought it'd be a lot easier to show you instead welcome to wild river minions have spawned first turrets destroy [Music] now let's hear from david for an update on champions thanks everyone [Music] hey friends davis you here back again to talk about champions first of all a huge thank you to all the players who participated and gave feedback during the regional alpha since then the team has been working hard on addressing that feedback and polishing the champion roster for example we tuned the yasuo's sweeping blade to be more consistent especially around the edge cases and we made some quality of life improvements for jyn's curtain call so that it is easier to use and be more potent as you can see we aren't going crazy with champions this time around making only minor adjustments during the alpha you told us that most champions were in a good spot already and it was awesome seeing all of your epic league moment highlights now we do have one more thing to share well actually it's six more things check it out so [Music] [Music] we hope they feel amazing to play now we know our work isn't done yet there is no feedback to address and many more champions in the pipeline so please look out for more information as we continue our development thanks friends that's all the new info from us for now we'll check it again before the beta ends with more information on what's next and when we're testing in more regions once again thank you so much for tuning in and for all the support it means a lot to both me and the team thanks everyone [Music] you", "vsSkmKwxum8": "hello nephew and today our man came cook I have a cracking cookie recipe for you now sadly I can't claim credit for these cracking cookie need too much alliteration my lovely wife came up with this recipe and it uses the delicious indigenous Australian nut the macadamia nut now the great thing about macadamia nuts is that they're really high in fat they're around 3/4 fat so they're great for a keto diet so this is my wife is macadamia cookie recipe for this recipe you will need 50 grams of salted macadamia nuts 250 grams of unsalted macadamia nuts 300 grams of almond meal 210 grams of powdered stevia 60 grams of coconut oil 2 and a half teaspoons of bicarb soda and 2 teaspoons of vanilla bean paste roughly chopped the 50 grams of salted macadamia nuts in a food processor a blender or in this case I'm using my Thermomix so you just want a rough consistency and then just put these to the side and then turn the 250 grams of unsalted macadamia nuts into a nut butter place the nut Cena blender food processor or in this case in Thermomix and blend it on a high speed until you get a smooth paste and you'll need to do this in a few stages so I suggest I've just done it for about five seconds on a high speed and I'm just going to scrape down the sides and repeat the process and this is the kind of consistency that you're after and into the nut butter I'm gonna add all of the other ingredients and I'm gonna mix this together on a reverse speed so that the blades aren't continuing to cut the nuts that are in there so if you don't have a thermal mix I suggest doing this step by hand now the consistency will be quite crumbly but as long as you can make it hold together it's ready to go and then take about a tablespoons worth of the mix roll it into a ball and then flatten it out onto a baking tray on with baking Pepa let's enter a rough cookie shape the mix will be quite crumbly but this is what's going to give the cookie they're very short texture and you can put half a macadamia nut in the center of each one if you like you don't have to this recipe will make about 24 cookies depending on how big you make them and then these go into a preheated oven 175 degrees Celsius or around three hundred and forty-five degrees Fahrenheit for 10 to 12 minutes until they're starting to brown remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking tray completely before eating once they've cooled completely you can store them in an airtight container or enjoy them straight away give this one a taste mmm so good now they're texture similar to a shortbread if you enjoyed my video please click like and I'd also love you to subscribe and when you do subscribe make sure you click on the Bell so do you get notified each time I upload a video thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "FWVArIwSDgk": "what up guys it's kanna sam and i am here to review another cbd product for you so let's get into it [Music] today i'm going to be reviewing a new product from a company called concentrated concepts and it is jack frost cbg g as in george so this is it it comes in a one gram bag or a seven gram bag and both are transparent on the back which i really like because you can see the bud so um this is a really cool product and it's really great for users who are looking to like most cbd users are looking to relax so if you aren't familiar with cbg basically it's just another compound found in the cannabis plant and it's still undergoing a lot of clinical trials because it is fairly new but just like cbd it offers a ton of health benefits such as it reduces inflammation it helps with sleep it helps with depression helps with anxiety and interestingly cbg is now being found to increase brain cell count in older patients as well so um that's a really interesting development that recently came out they are still studying it like i said um but cbg i feel cbg a little more than i do traditional cbd the effects are very very similar i'd say that this just feels a little bit stronger but like i always say it's so dependent on the person because i've given this to people and they don't feel anything and i've given this to people and they pass out and go to sleep so i think i'm a pretty like middle of the road person and it does relax me but not to a point where i'm like passed out if you are a seasoned cbd user or a thc user this is going to be one of the more mild things that you will take some people who smoke all the time told me that they don't feel anything but then newer users are loving it because it gives them the effects of the cbg but they're not like high like all cbd products and unlike thc products these do not get you high they will just give you physical effects and what i do also like about cbg is that i feel it a lot in my body so if you have any aches or pains you're sore from the gym you have an injury this is really helpful um that's what i what i do like about it in terms of packaging i am in love i love the way that concentrated concepts does their packaging and their vibe and style it's like dark with bright colors and it really stands out to me and pops off the shelves this is jack frost which is perfect for winter time the company recently came out with it and people are really really really liking it they said they've had a ton of success with this exact product so i'm going to open it and tell you what it smells like let's see i'm going to open the one gram bag and in terms of like how much to smoke it's so dependent on you um i smoked like a bowl of it last night and that definitely got me relaxed uh other people may need to smoke less or more just depends so let's see it's gotta really definitely smell it it's potent it has like a bit of a um like a woody smell but in like a good wood you know winter time outdoor burning wood smell which is cool and it's strong it's like you smell it so you know it's good stuff it is also what's really cool and what i like um about this and since they call it jack frost you literally can see like white particles it's so hard to see on camera but there are white particles like with remnants on the plastic that are left from it and then on the individual bud it is all white and frosty like even on my nail some got on i think that is really cool i've never seen that before with this like white type of snowy it literally looks like there's snow on it which is really really cool so at the end of the day it smells great it tastes really good tastes like the same type of like woodsy wintertime taste that you probably would want in wintertime um and it is perfect to help you relax if you are anxious i'm really prone to anxiety this is really really helpful for it because i can just smoke a little and then chill out but a lot of these products actually will make me too relaxed where then i can't do anything and i can't function so that's what i do love about this is that it is mild enough to keep functioning on keep working go out and about with your day but it's just you can tell it's just like you feel a little bit more mellow so for those of you looking for a milder product that you will feel you gotta try this out it's really good thank you concentrated concepts and um yeah i can't wait to try more products this is really awesome not every company is making products with cbg in it because it is fairly new so this is really unique um great look great packaging great taste great feel so i give it a 10 out of 10. so thank you guys so much for watching if you like my channel please hit the subscribe button like it share your thoughts i'd love to hear if you want me to review other products what you think of jack frost cbg and concentrated concepts in general or any other cbd companies or products that you like love hate let me know i want to hear about it thanks guys and talk to you soon [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "H0k2AnuO2UM": "if we're going to be quarantined at home you might as well spend your shelter in place with some great pizza I'm Erik with Erik Anderson homes and I've spent the better part of the past decade honing my pizza making skills as someone who eats pizza almost daily I can honestly say the pizza I make at home rivals just about anything I buy it's not only fresh and fun to make but way cheaper so here's my pandemic pizza recipe which is really just a basic New York style pizza once the dough has five basic ingredients water salt yeast flour and thyme and that last part time is where most people go wrong even the so-called pros time really is a key ingredient that can make or break a pizza dough my recipe yields enough to feed an army I have six kids or four 14-inch pizzas at the end of this video I'll share a version of that recipe that makes half the amount or enough for two 13-inch pizzas or enough to feed someone who doesn't have enough children to qualify for their own zip code I start with 640 grams of water about 92 degrees I do measure everything on a scale kitchen scale and grams as precision is essential to baking after that I dissolve 26 grams of salt in the water once that's done add 2/3 tsp of active dry yeast I used safe instant yeast which requires no proofing let that hydrate in the water for about a minute and then stir to dissolve finally I had 1,000 grams of high-protein flour I like you know those better for bread flour and stir in a stand mixer for about 90 seconds not over kneading the dough is critical or it'll result in a dough that's too elastic once the dough is mixed here's where the final criticals two steps come in I cover the dough and let it rise at room temperature for two hours after that I divide the dough into 4 separate dough balls put that airs tight storage containers and let it rise in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours 24 ideals ours is ideal for this recipe but the dough will still be good for up to two days if you won't use it all by then freeze it after 24 hours and when you want to use the frozen dough let it thaw in your refrigerator for 24 hours prior to using when you're ready to bake pre-heat your oven to 550 degrees for at least an hour and take the dot of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes prior to cooking shape the dough into about a 14-inch circle and top with sauce cheese and whatever else you like I'll shape and prepare the pizza on parchment paper so the raw dough doesn't stick to the oven you could skip the puff that paper by dusting with flour or cornmeal but I prefer a cleaner no which you can get with the parchment paper well dust with a little flour prior to shaping so the dough doesn't stick to my hands or the paper lately my favorite way to prepare sauce is to mix about 2/3 of ground Tomatoes with about 1/3 heavy tomato puree then mix in either Parmesan cheese or oregano to taste she's wise I typically use a whole milk mozzarella sometimes I'll opt for a mozzarella provolone Blin once the pizzas in the oven I'll bake for 3 minutes or so before removing the parchment paper and then let the pizza continue to bake until the cheese turns that beautiful and golden brown about another 5 minutes at this temperature if you've preheated your oven properly I'll often kick on the broiler for that last minute of bake time to get a nice light char but be careful if you do this as the pizza couldn't burn very quickly I'm Eric with Erik Anderson homes and I hope you enjoyed this recipe as much as I do [Music] you", "gusilFOwxfI": "[Music] hi everyone it's hazel and welcome to another video first of all i want to thank you all because we have already reached 2 000 subscribers [Applause] and i want you to know that i do appreciate your continued support and if you haven't done so make sure to subscribe and don't forget to share my videos because you never know whom you're going to help by sharing so again thank you so much for all your love and support okay so moving on in today's video i'm going to share to you my recipe to a flavorful meal it's not the bion it's not all the salt that you add into your dish but it's something that is natural something that you already have in your kitchen and the ingredients to my recipe these are all basic you use it every day in your cooking you use it to saute your food and give that nice aroma to your dish so before i move on to my recipe i want to answer two questions related to our video for today and that is so thank you so much for those questions first of all there is no one-size-fits-all diet when it comes to chronic kidney disease what do i mean by that it means that my diet may not be the best diet for you it may not be a diet that is most suitable for you okay second of all you need to speak to your dietitian if you don't have one ask your doctor about salt intake but what i can tell you is that when it comes to salt intake the daily recommended diet is one teaspoon which is this size so this is the recommended amount of daily salt intake okay now there's also what we call sodium what is the difference between sodium and salt salt is this it's what you add to your food okay and sodium on the other hand is something that is already in your food it's processed i don't eat processed food like bacon ham sausages and so on and so forth foods that are found in packages are considered high sodium food but the way to find that out for sure is to look at the label ready to go meals or microwavable foods have sodium content whether it be meat bread pancakes muffins and anything that's in a package however there are better options like fresh fruits and vegetables because they contain low sodium and for your information everything has sodium in it but pre-packed foods like frozen foods have higher sodium in them so for ckd patients like me it is better to choose fresh food for a chance to slow down the progression of the kidney disease and that is why i prefer to eat fresh vegetables because they have low sodium content and they've really been helping me throughout these years to slow down the progression of my ckd and i do believe that a plant-based diet helps one's overall health [Music] so i hope that that is clear to you and if you have any more questions please don't hesitate to leave me a comment down below i really love reading all your comments i would love to answer more questions so please don't hesitate to do so so one of the challenges that i face being a c kd patient is that my food doesn't have taste it's bland because of that i've created a sauce that's going to add flavor into my dish and the secret is in this jar it's in this jar so what's in this jar i'm going to share you my secret and i hope you watch it till the end of the video growing up in my home country in the philippines we always have sauce for whatever kind of dish we have on the table these sauces or condiments have such great flavor when added onto a dish but they are too salty now when it comes to takeout food they also have these sauces and again these are not in my kidney diet so avoid these as well so instead i switched to a sauce that is made of fresh ingredients this sauce recipe is made of fresh garlic fresh ginger fresh onion freshly squeezed lemon juice i'm also using some spicy pepper whichever you want i'm using green long pepper because that's what i have right now if you don't like spicy you can take that out but if you love spicy you can make use also of serrano jamaican pepper or jalapeno whatever you want all these fresh ingredients are high in vitamin c they are antioxidants and immune boosters [Music] it's very easy to make just cut up or mince all the ingredients [Music] and when you're finished doing that just put all the ingredients in a blender or if you have a food processor you can use that as well into the mixture i also add sweet rice vinegar low sodium soy sauce some dijon mustard and lots of olive oil just simply puree everything until you get a smooth saucy thick texture [Music] smells good smells delicious um this can last for at least two weeks i mean i don't use it all the time and this is potent by the way you can just use one teaspoon i scoop actually i use one teaspoon each time it's very potent so you don't have to put a lot in your plate [Music] and you store it in the refrigerator so that it can last longer try this recipe and i promise you that it's going to add flavor into your meal [Music] okay [Music] so i hope you like my video for today until next time bye", "f0fiAVWyt1A": "[Music] do you ever get done eating a good sub sandwich and just feel so guilty because you know you just took a bunch of carbs that you really shouldn't have had ever feel that way well fear no more because today I'm going to teach you how to make low carb sub sandwich bread and not just plain ol sub sandwich bread but Italian herb and cheese sub sandwich bread so the next time you read us up you don't have to feel guilty anymore so roll up those sleeves and let's get cooking to start pre-heat your oven to 100 degrees and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper in a medium mixing bowl combine 1 cup almond flour 1 cup garbanzo flour and 1 cup vital wheat gluten add 1 teaspoon garlic powder one teaspoon salt two tablespoons instant yeast make sure it's instant yeast there's a difference between instant and dry active and how it reacts so make sure it is instant yeast and 1 tablespoon dry oregano whisk the ingredients together until all ingredients are fully combined [Music] add half cup of fresh grated Parmesan not the can fresh off the block whisk until the cheese is evenly distributed then set the bowl aside in a large mixer bowl add 1 cup warm water and make sure it's warm to your touch not hot not cold just warm 3 tablespoons olive oil or oil of your choice 3 tablespoons honey and one large room temperature egg make sure it is room temperature the temperature of your dough is very important when it comes to used bread if it's too hot it won't rise right if it's too cold it will rise right so make sure everything is room temperature slowly add the bowl of dry ingredients to your wet ingredients you be down low 15 seconds or until all the ingredients are combined and no dry ingredients is left in your bowl scrape down the paddle and sides if needed [Music] change out to your dough hook attachment for your standing mixer [Music] and mix on high for three minutes scrape down the sides of the bowl and push the dough to the center of the bowl you and mix on high for three more minutes if you don't have a dough hook attachment or a standing mixer you'll need to knead the dough by hand for about seven to ten minutes or until it's very stretchy divide the dough into 4 equal portions and place two portions at a time on your prepared baking sheets you're going to basically have a top and bottom on one baking sheet and the top and bottom on another baking sheet this yields about two subs spray your hands with oil and roll each portion into a sub shape the tighter you roll it the born round the sub will be so basically if you want a more round or domed sub then you're gonna need to roll it tighter whereas if you don't mind a more flatter top like a hoagie roll then you don't have to roll it quite as tight as tight so it depends on how much of the dome you want on your sub sandwich so the higher the dome you want the tighter you need to roll it once they're shaped cover with spray the plastic wrap make sure you spray it so it doesn't stick and let it rise in your 100 degree oven for 20 minutes once it's risen remove it from the oven now sometimes the dough spreads and it kind of looks like two big blobs on your baking sheet it's okay that's what it does when it rises sometimes all you need to do is reshape the dough into the sub shape that you want so if you want a 6-inch sub then shape it into six inches if you want age ten and sub then shape it into ten inches and again remember the tighter you roll it the higher dome you're going to have so cover it back up and pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees make sure you keep them covered while it's preheating most ovens take a couple minutes to get up to 400 degrees you want to make sure you keep your dough covered so it doesn't dry out in those few minutes as it does dry it out quickly so make sure you keep it covered once your ovens preheated uncover your dough you want to make sure it's uncovered don't make it with that plastic wrap it'll melt all to it and bake at 400 degree degrees for 12 to 15 minutes so if you just want it lightly golden and then just bake it for 12 minutes if you like a little more of a toasty top then bake it for 15 minutes when it's done baking remove it from the oven and let it rest on the baking sheet for 3 minutes then transfer it to a wire rack to cool depending on what type of sandwich I want that depends on how long I'm going to bake the bread if I just want a simple sub with some deli sliced meats and some veggies a little bit sauce then I'm just gonna go for 12 minutes and leave it just light golden if I want a warm salad such as a meatball sandwich or a french dip or something a little more hearty then I go for the more toasty top that way it has a firmer more sturdy hold and but it's entirely up to you as far as how toasty you want to top so that's just my preference so once it's cooled you're gonna carefully trim the dark bottom off of each bun you want to go very slowly and very carefully because you only want that dark brown crusty thin layer trimmed off so that you'll have a smooth soft Center in between your sub buns so go very carefully cuz you don't want to trim up a pure button now you should have smooth centers in both of your subs now if you're not going to eat them right away then you can store them in an airtight container in your pantry or on your on your countertop for up to two days if you're not gonna use it within two days you can put them in the freezer until you're ready to use them but don't keep them in the freezer for longer than three months it I mean you could but I wouldn't advise it so if you do freeze them when you're ready to use them follow them out on your countertop don't try to rush rush the process and put them in your microwave or put them in your stove to defrost them they can get chewy that way and they only take a couple minutes to thaw out on your countertop so when you're ready to use them place them on your countertop for maybe up to five minutes not even that usually and they should be completely thought if you want to warm them after they're completely thawed then you can just pop them in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds just to give them a little warmth but don't do that until they are fully thawed out and now you have it to

ames in the vsf with me today are anup and rahul from cisco who are responsible for the media and entertainment vertical within cisco and they're going to be talking about all mobile videos new st 2110 ob van welcome anoop and rahul hi guys welcome i'm glad you're here today on a nice sunny day right yes looks like all of us are sitting somewhere at the beach side i like it i like it it's talking soaking all the sun we get right there we go all right well let's get started thank you thanks rest so first of all good morning good afternoon good evening to everyone wherever you are joining us today from um so today we are going to talk about a case study for a fully 4k uhd capable ob van for one of our customers all mobile video and how cisco's ip fabric for media solution was able to address some of the key requirements and use cases for this customer so a little bit about the customer here so all mobile video is one of the biggest production facilities in new york you know and they've produced and transmitted uh some of the most prestigious events including the oscars the grammys you know adobe max in summer etc they basically catered to a variety of pre and post production use cases depending on their client needs yeah and yeah and as you can see the as the business was expanding what amv wanted to do was you know build a fully 4k uhd capable ob van to target uh events such as you know sports games concerts and even you know emerging streaming services like amazon prime video netflix etc as you can see they wanted to use this ob ran for a variety of use cases and that's why they wanted an architecture which was very dynamic and flexible and one and one that can support the ever-changing client needs which also includes you know having to do some pre and post event shows and having the capability to extend production beyond the truck walls yeah so let's so let's look at what it boils down to when it comes to the core technical requirements right for this customer so what the customer needed was basically a network based on cots equipment this is to make sure that they can leverage this equipment for a variety of use cases and are not limited to a certain specific functional uh you know box also they wanted to make sure they are deploying standards-based fabric based on you know the new simple 2110 standards and nmos etc also as you can see from their you know use case they wanted a very flexible and scalable architecture you know they because they cater to a variety of use cases you know they go to sports events they go to concerts network had to be very very flexible and dynamic and then one of the most important things that they wanted was to simplify the d2 operations to make sure that at any given point of time they have insights into the network and fabric then also they also needed a scalable pdp implementation so that they can connect a lot of endpoints to the switches and then they wanted to make sure that the network is secure and they wanted to have granular x-axis you know the capability to make sure that they uh can deny or allow only certain specific hosts and flows uh through that network okay and then obviously redundancy and uh you know reduced footprint was one of their requirements as well so so uh let's look at the slide i mean and on this slide as well as the next few slides we'll look at the high level design of the architecture and also you know deep dive into some of the key requirements and how cisco's ip fabric for media solution address those so as you can see on this slide the customer wanted a scalable and flexible architecture and what we went with and what we call it is like a hybrid spine leaf architecture okay made of 9508 the nexus 9508r chassis as the spine with 36 board 100 gig line cuts and 93 180 ycfx nexus switches as remote leaves okay so this architecture gives you the capability and the flexibility to connect end points now directly to the spine which resides inside the truck and to connect endpoints to the remote leaves which are outside the truck and one important point again i would like to bring out here is you know they went with the hundred gig line cars as of now but the same 9508 chassis can be reused and can be upgraded to 400 gig line cards as and when the customer would need probably in the future and another thing i would like to bring out here is the broadcast controller was the gv orbit the gb orbit completely integrates with our cisco's data center network manager which is the dc m and dcnm is basically a software a vm you know running on a box which helps with day 0 to day 2 operations for our nexus switches in the fabric and this whole network is capable of sending you know [Music] flows from all the way from 1.5 gig hd to 12 gig uhd and depending as as you can see from this slide from there were a number of grass valley endpoints and depending on that we required some port capacities to be 10 gig 25 gig 50 gig as well as 100k and we also required a long range connectivity between the spines and the leaves okay and then another important thing i would like to bring you about is you know the cisco's nbm technology which is developed by cisco specifically for our media industry this is to provide non-blocking fabrics for carrying uncompressed video or your any ancillary flows over the fabric okay and this from this this gives you a little bit more overview of you know what were the other endpoints etc that were used in the system to build this ob van and if you can see from the list on the left hand side there was gb orbit and cisco gcnm for control and monitoring the ip switches with the cisco's nexus 9508r and the 93185cfx the cameras were ldax ip100 switches replays there were gateways and you know multiviewers etc all of this running over the cisco's ip fabric for media and with this i'd like to hand this over to my colleague rahul who will go over the challenges that we faced for this customer and how we address them using our solution hey thank you anub so uh as enough described right the system had to be scalable and non-blocking and it not only stopped it didn't it don't it did not stop there right but uh we went on from designing the entire fabric to be non-blocking as well as uh you know think about timing like with any 2110 deployment you have to make sure that you know all these endpoints are synchronized uh to a nanosecond accuracy and this is and the way we went about doing that was through pdp and so i'll talk about how did we scale pdp right and then uh we'll focus more around how did we go about simplifying some of these operation challenges and then touch upon security so as you move on to the next slide let's talk about uh this this whole system and and and how did we go about addressing each of these challenges right now uh this is an interesting uh so even even before we started this project right one of the biggest requirements you know when you when you essentially use a cloud space network to transport uncompressed media is that the entire system has to be non-blocking right because you come from an sdi router which is traditionally non-blocking to now an ip network now what people may not realize is that hey while each individual network switch can be non-blocking because it can do line rate multicast forwarding and replication now as you start building networks like how you have the stage box a leaf connected to the spine and you have multiple links going from the reef to the spine you know it reminds me of you know taking two sdi routers and you have tie lines between them right so there is this whole requirement that you know hey how do you make this system non-blocking right it's not just about having each individual entity non-blocking now uh to describe the challenge we faced let's just take the scenario right so in this scenario let's assume that i have four sources uh you know each one is configured to do uhd and and again for the sake of simplicity let's assume that the links between the stage block leaf and the spine were 40 gig right uh so if you if you look at it right theoretically anyone looking at the system would say that hey yeah this is a non-blocking system because you have as much as 40 gig of sources because i have four uh you know ultra hd sources in the network and i have about 120 gig of bandwidth from that leaf to the spine so it should be non-blocking right now what people uh you know as as you start talking to a lot of broadcast engineers or network engineers for that market they don't realize is that when you have multiple paths you know going from one network switch to another network switch you know the way protocols go about routing each of these sources to the destination you know all depends on what we call as uh you know a hash function right so as you advance these slides west you'll notice that what could potentially happen is you know as you go ahead you see you keep advancing that could be a possibility that all of your video ends up taking the same path right and that path can become blocking you see if that's that's because networks themselves do not know okay this particular 2110 feed is of a video this particular multicast feed is of an audio and this is a particular feed or that belongs to an ancillary right it's just going to randomly pick paths and you could end up in this situation where you know all videos takes the same path and that that way it could become a blocking system and this was the challenge and the way cisco went about uh in you know solving this challenge is through nbm right so as you advance the slide whereas you'll see if i enable nbm on the system what we're really doing is we're making this entire network bandwidth aware so what it means is that as you start routing different flows from the leaf to the spines now you see with every request the system realizes you know hey by the way that this particular flow belongs to a video this belongs to an audio this belongs to an ancillary data and because this whole system is bandwidth aware you get a much cleaner distribution of traffic along these links and and that was how we we went about ensuring that this whole system remained non-blocking right and and as a result now the customer can confidently go and connect these stage boxes and connect a bunch of their you know cameras and not having to worry about hey will i ever run into an issue where one of these links becomes blocking and i want to recreate the reiterate this message to the audience saying that hey because i've always said right people say you know what i can just throw bandwidth at the problem you know oh you're running into a blocking issue just add more links uh you have to realize that you know it's it's adding more links only reduces the probability of you know making off of this of reducing the fact that this problem would not take place but it's not going to completely avoid it and to completely avoid it you need some kind of an intelligence and that's what we did with nb so that was challenge number one now this was a tough one right challenge number two is uh okay now that we've you know addressed uh flows what about timing you you see media simply 2059-2 it it mandates that uh you know the offset the ptp offset should be less than plus or minus 500 nanoseconds now it's relatively very easy to do this at a low scale but for this customer we had to do this at a very large scale because they had lots and lots of end points that were connected you know directly to that 9508 chassis and most of them were also you know working in this breakout mode right so you could have a single interface but broken out into four lanes so that increases the number of ptp sessions uh you know by four on every port so what what happens as a result is that a single line card could be broken out to 144 ptp enabled interfaces uh so we had to figure out hey how do we go about ensuring that you can scale pdp and this is something that we're really proud of right so we went we went and we developed a feature again for the broadcast industry where rather than running the entire ptp process on the cpu of you know it's called the supervisor for those of you who are not familiar with you know a modular chassis so rather than running it in a centralized uh you know processor what cisco did is we offloaded the ptp functionality to each individual lime card cpu so this automatically increase the scale right because as you you know the only way you can increase the scale is by going with a distributed architecture so we don't have a single point uh that is responsible for talking pdp with every single client that's connected on the chassis now as soon as we did that right we took this ptp process and we executed it to run on each and every line card you see an eight dot plan card has you know an a spot chassis has eight line cards now we are able to individually scale each of these line cards to that 144 pdp sessions or you know the entire chassis can now support about you know close to 1024 ptp enabled interfaces which you know humongously benefits uh you know that whole requirement of enabling a large-scale pdp deployment yet meeting uh cinti's in accuracy requirement of all of this being within plus or minus 500 nanoseconds and and now you know you have a system that is intelligent and scalable with both flows as well as pdp so that that address is the second point now coming to the third challenge right so this is where uh you know even for the customer it was the very first time a lot of them were interfacing with an ip system right all of them have really good knowledge on broadcast but did not have enough exposure to ip so they really wanted a single pane of glass to monitor the application which is 2110 you know all the way from the end points when i say end points is the you know might be gateways the the cameras and how these flows are traversing the network so to be to be able to monitor the health of these 2110 flows uh from the network and the way we went about doing this for the customer is uh leveraging a technology called streaming telemetry now uh what is steaming telemetry right now if you if you go back a few years you know the way networks were constantly monitored is that you had an entity that queried the network right every every five minutes or every 30 minutes asking hey how are you doing and the network says yeah i'm doing all right and this polling wasn't fast enough for uh you know media because we're all talking about real-time uh video right you're talking about video that's going on there so we had to really change the way you know the health of the network and the flows are propagated to this system that's monitoring uh you know the overall health right and we leverage streaming telemetry as a result so what happens in this architecture is that each individual network switch be the stage box switch or the spine itself that's constantly streaming information out to dcnm which is then feeding that information to gv orbit so gv orbit becomes a single pane of glass where the broadcast team can you know get this end-to-end visualization of how the flows are traversing the network and the health you know the bandwidth usage you know the cpu utilization the memory utilization all of that is fed to tv and all of this is done in real time so that uh solved you know what was one of the biggest challenges uh you know on getting this complete visibility into hey what's going on in the network because as you advance these slides yeah if you go to the next slide we'll talk about uh um one more requirement was around the bit rate right see you're always talking about 2110 flows right how do you know the camera is actually sending if the camera is configured to do three gig hd is it actually transmitting three gig of traffic or close to three graph traffic on the network right and and uh we've added the ability to not only monitor the interface stack because the interface could have multiple flows on it you can go as granular as looking at the stats on a per flow basis right so you get you get the stats of the radio flow the ancillary flow the audio flow and again right through steaming symmetry all of this is fed to dcnm which in turn feeds all of this to orbit so this is what i call uh something that is always an afterthought for for a lot of our customers which shouldn't be the case right because you all you know i mean i i get it right for a lot of our customers who are making this journey from sdi to ipp like amv they're more focused on making sure that the system is scalable you know hey all i need to make sure is that my video and audio works right but one thing you never had to worry with sdi was security right like no one could go and hack an sdi router or connect an you know a laptop to an hdr router right but fast forward in the ip world you know nothing is going to stop me from taking my laptop running a wireshark capture and plugging in and you know trying to subscribe to uh something that's being recorded right you could you know have a season finale of a pretty uh you know cool series that that's being recorded and you know someone can just take a copy of of of that video so it you know security is a factor that you know would encourage everyone to make it a top priority and just like you know as we started speaking with am and we they also realized this and this becomes more so dangerous with this whole stage box concept right because you know as long as it's in the crop you would think hey it's still relatively safe because no one's gonna no one who's unauthorized is gonna walk in inside the truck but because you're extending your network outside the truck and you're putting the you know you're extending it to the so to some of these areas that are accessible to anyone what we ended up doing is we went with a model where by default everything is denied right so nothing is allowed to participate in the network and gb orbit becomes you know what i call the entity that is responsible for identifying who is allowed to participate in the network so leveraging a very simple api call gv orbit pushes this what i call a policy onto cisco's ip fabric and instructs it saying that hey these are the list of endpoints that you know can send traffic these are the list of endpoints or devices destinations that can subscribe to traffic and those policies are then enforced on the network so what it means for the customer is that because you have this you know by default everyone is denied and you're only allowing you know what devices are authorized it's it gives them some peace of mind that you know hey no one is no one will be able to go and you know connect something that's unauthorized to either send some traffic or subscribe to something that they not allowed right so security became you know you know it went from a nice to have to something now it has to you needed it and we've just made all of this extremely simple with this policy model through cisco's ip fabric for media so that you know addresses that portion and finally you know we we took security another step right it's not just about allowing a device to transmit or allowing a device to subscribe to a flow but remember right as you design a system you you design it to be non-blocking so you go with the assumption that uh you know a certain end point is only going to transmit traffic at a certain rate right because you at the end of the day you design the system to uh uh you know allow for for for this to happen but what if a camera that was only allowed that was only supposed to do 1.5 gigahd accidentally is doing 3gb hd right so it is sending more traffic than what you intended it to send so rather than allowing that stream to go through and oversubscribing the network what we go what we do with cisco's ip fabric for media is we enforce that camera to only send you know that much amount of traffic it's allowed to and again for us jv orbit was uh you know that entity that defined hey how much traffic can a given camera send right so orbit went and pushed ahead a policy called flow policy that defines these parameters and we were able to detect right hey is that camera sending traffic at that rate and if it is sending an excessive rate we protect the infrastructure by blocking the camera and we send a notification back to grass valley saying that okay you know someone is trying to uh you know consume or rather transmit more traffic than they're not allowed to right so then it could either be an accident or uh you know someone did by by mistake or if someone is trying to do it because they want to you know uh you know oversubscribe the network you in in any case you're protected right and you're not defined so if i have to summarize uh you know the challenges that were presented in front of us was around the system being non-blocking uh the ability to scale pdp and simplify operation and secure the infrastructure so we've gone about doing that again right we addressed non-blocking portion using nbm we went about scaling ptp by ensuring that we have this ptp offload we went about simplifying operations by ensuring that you have this telemetry based real-time notification that's fed all the way to gb orbit and finally we went about securing the infrastructure through these policies right so which you could enforce who's allowed to participate in the network and what what bandwidth they're allowed to transmit to and so on so where's uh you know if i have to you know we quickly summarize uh everything that we've done for this customer again through our partnership with grass valley now they have a system that is reliable is designed to scale and is designed to be flexible right and like anup was pointing out you know it was really really important to ensure that whatever they built today they can seamlessly expand uh or they could uh you know bring in newer use cases onto the system and and we've put in the infrastructure there that you know from you know they can just take it and grow as as the business grows as well that's great thank you very much so have you um have you actually seen been able to go out and see this vehicle in action or has coveted prevented you from uh going out and taking a look yeah well um we we have actually you know we were all set to roll this vehicle uh into uh nab uh this year but uh you know we're all in the situation where unfortunately that couldn't happen so for now it's all been remote updates and uh you know just working through them uh through uh yeah uh online uh that's unfortunate well hopefully they're getting some good use out of it so i know right yeah yeah yes so so i see you you guys have done a lot of things to um make the the life of the uh the engineer in charge on the ob van um make make that person's life easier uh giving them some tools and and some other things what what else can be done to to you know simplify their their life and to and to make their job uh easier and more efficient that's that's a great question whereas right um you know to begin with right some of the tools that we've exposed to this engineer was all around hit being able to traverse you know how this flows going from say a camera all the way to a video switcher right so giving that flow visibility that's a good starting step so that you know that addresses some of the concerns that the engineers have that hey how do i know what flows are traversing right in the system but as we you know develop more features for our customers what we've also done is uh we've enabled this feature called rtp flow monitoring now given all simply 2110 flows are rtp flows something that makes our a6 really unique is that we can do deep packet inspection so we can go all the way into you know the rtp header and and thereby monitor the sequence numbers of rtp packets and as we detect missing sequences we can create an alert saying that hey you're losing packets right now to give you an example let's say you know you have the camera connected to a stage box and let's say the camera is recording traffic that's being fed to the to the video switcher and then the switcher starts reporting some errors so you see bad video on screen right now how do you know right is the problem with the camera is it the problem with the the stage box switch is the problem between with the links between the stage box and the chassis right now given that our switches can do deep packet inspection it is very we can quickly in you know pinpoint where along this path is the errors being introduced so you see these these capabilities uh that we have in our asics we're now turning them into use cases for customers wherein they can you know simplify the amount of time it takes right should something go bad like you know you have a bad cable being able to pinpoint where along this path you know is this problem happening so this is one of uh you know several examples that i can provide where we are all focusing on leveraging the capability that is there on the silicon and software to really simplify the amount of time uh you know the engineer takes to figure if something were to go around what exactly is going on just to add to that right i mean if you've ever troubleshooted a multicast issue it probably sometimes takes hours to get to the to know even what what is happening what where where it's going wrong right with this feature we can actually reduce the mean time to resolution to even you know seconds because we get instant notification of not only when we detect the problem but where exactly that problem is occurring in the network yeah that sounds like a big help so um one other thing that's always interests me this seems like a very capable vehicle all by itself how does it go about you know moving out of being a an island unto itself and cooperating with with other vehicles or infrastructure that may be installed at a venue how do how do all those connections work again you know a great question was you know i you know i'm a firm believer that as this industry transitions to ip you have to make the best out of what ip gives you right which is flexibility and and and uh what this architecture really enables uh you know this customer to do is to take that truck and let's say they want to connect to you know an ip infrastructure that's late in this in the stadium you know you are essentially extending the network on the truck with that of that stadium yet through these security policies right the uh administer the broadcast operator in the truck can actually define what streams can be either you know sent to that third party or what streams you can ingest from the third party right through these granular rules so net net uh we have the ability to extend this nbm you know this whole bandwidth awareness across systems so if there's another another ob truck that shows up now let's assume that uh you know uh you know that's also an ip enabled ob truck you can interconnect these trucks and make sure that these tire lines are also bandwidth aware right and that that is that is so you don't have to worry about hey will i be over subscribing these tire lines right this ip turlings and the other beauty about you know the again the asic functionality that we have on the nexus 9k is we can do uh multicast nand so this really helps right let's say an ob truck shows up and they have they happen to be using an overlapping address because you know at the end of the day you know the address has to be unique right because let's say they're using a certain address that belong to you know certain cameras but i'm using that same multicast address for a different application i can still ingest those flows to my truck leverage this feature called multicast at you know network address translation to translate that ip addresses to you know a non-overlapping range and still route that signal to any destination in my truck right and i can even do that if i'm distributing content right or if i'm handing off content to third party i can mat you know the 2110 flows to a completely different ip schema and send it to them so this serves two purpose right it protects you from this you don't have to worry about hey what happens if address space is overlapping but it also brings in some amount of security rights because you sometimes you you do not want to expose hey what addresses that you are internally using to to you know some third parties so that becomes an amazing you know use case where uh you know i can totally do that and and hand off content uh you know to anyone who's interested in right so you know those those are the

live well thanks again guys fingers crossed no problem thanks thank", "nqGDdw3BREM": "keto walnut bread recipe two ingredients only we delete the prepared mix hi i'm ginger i've been eating low carb for the last seven years and if these videos have been useful to you please don't forget to subscribe before you leave so you don't miss the next one you might remember we did the bread rolls before we use the lids a base in all the possible ways i live off of little toasties personally but when we went hiking last month and we posted these pictures on instagram people were really interested about the bread that we were using and we actually were rather clever there unexpectedly if i may say so because just before we left i was like oh you know we're going into this place that doesn't necessarily have even a kitchen open it was an airbnb but it didn't have a kitchen open because of kovid's steel so how are we gonna eat for three days and one idea was let's bake an entire loaf of the lids of walnut bread let's cut it in slices bring it in a tupperware and then if in a tesco we find the butter ham salami anything we want to put in a sandwich guess what we can make a sandwich and not only worked well not only looked delicious not only i actually just loaded it on butter at some point but it raised the interest of people saying oh i'm going on holiday what where can i find it what can i do and i was like honestly if you make one of these it's the easiest easiest thing that you can do an entire loaf comes close to 20 grams of cabs so depending on many slices just keep that into consideration i add open sandwiches just to skim a bit on the bread but in all fairness possibly because of the eye cream possibly because i don't know i went over in protein i had this i went hiking and i lost weight on my holiday which hasn't happened in years of holidays so just so you know this is how it worked for me and that's probably why people were interested to know how do you make this well this is how you literally just have the prepared mixer a sparkling water that's it now i have the big one kilo version uh you make four loaves out of these you measure out 250 grams and pair 250 grams you use 300 milliliters of water it does thankfully come with the instruction right away on the package so you don't even need the lids a booklet that usually comes with it and in this bread you can find flaxseed flour which is amazing pure omega-3 walnuts bean flour pumpkin seed protein silius powder baking powder sea salt all certified organic which in germany means something like it's not just a vague term like here so that actually is something that you pay for and you actually have the benefit from as usual if you want to get friendly with liza and it's always worth it for me because notice i still buy my stuff from them i'm not sending these for free you can find the links down in the description below there's the low carb pack the keto starter pack you get those on offer prices if you get the kilo instead of getting the 250 grams to just make one loft that of course has a better price as well and the links that you find in the video description are affiliate meaning that and no extra cost to you actually there is a discount until the end of september you find the code the description below as well if you buy anything you get the discount and you're supporting the channel so if you do that thank you so much for the occasion i have extra walnuts from lidl just decorating on top so what do you do you you have your lizza prepared the mixer for walnut bread you have 300 milliliters of sparkling water i personally prefer myself with gloves because you need to go in like i try to do it with a spatula thumbs up you can start with that but then you really need to knead it so i've heard of people that can manage to do it with just still water i've never done it yet and there is a thing oh but if it's sparkling and it's been out for a while it's flat does it even matter apparently there's something to do with the acidity of the water rather than being steel or sparkling so i'm still using sparkling even if it's a bit flatter than you would expect still well just in case because i'm used to that when i used to make like proper bread and pasta with my grandmother 30 milliliter mix it was measure 300 right yeah the absorption happens immediately go quick go quick i was i was swimming in it a second ago where did it go where did it go when it stops sticking to the sides it's uh it's already all well absorbed that the flaxseed and the psyllium do wonders so much so that the flaxseed technically in the way that it absorbs it's how in most vegan recipes you replace egg and the psyllium is how in most vegan recipes you replace gluten necessarily just vegan in ours as well okay the particularity of liza is that again it comes in the mixer you just mix it with water and it's done uh but before even better than mixed book done but there are a few things that the process is very precise and you need to follow it believe me because i've done it right i've done it wrong and it came out still right but you prefer it blonder than brown black i think so therefore here's what we do you free form it on an oven tray into your loaf don't worry you pat it down because we now leave it here on its own for 15 minutes because believe it or not it's going to rise a bit on its own and we just believe that and i know that it happens so i'm happy with that we leave it there and because again i want to decorate it on top with the walnuts not just with the walnuts inside i add on top now so that maybe they are encased by the the growth pretty pretty looking these in no ways are indicative of where the slices should be because you should easily get 10 12 slices out of these come on the pretty ones thank you while you rest for 15 minutes we turn on the oven the highest possible elisa asked for 250 degrees celsius i have a fan and i barely get to 240 but hopefully 230 240 fan makes up for 250. we start eating it to that and and then we'll put it there once it's ready no i want to see how it grew like i want to do the split from here to in 15 minutes to see effectively how it grew so hopefully in the before and after i've just been in front of this log for 15 minutes but you've seen it grow and now we go into the oven and that is something that you have to follow very precisely i have done it not precisely it came out so good it's the one that i brought with me uh to hike but if you don't want it looking like brown bread when this shouldn't be technically well this is what you do the oven has been on heating up and warming up being ready for the loaf at 240 degrees celsius we're going to put the loaf there at 240 degrees celsius for the next 15 minutes then we turn it down to 210 degrees celsius and the loaf is still gonna be there for 50 minutes so for a total of one hour and five minutes then you need to let it cool completely because otherwise you can't cut the slices for the occasion i've never done it before but i'll put a metal tray with water to try and see if i can actually make the crust nice like the proper bread they do it in real bread so why not so remember 15 minutes first 240 50 5 00 minutes after at 210 then let it cool down and i'll see you when we can cut it down and we're back have you checked that the temperatures were high before then lower than 15 minutes then 50. then you take it out and you just wait for a second half an hour an hour at the very least this is clearly still a bit warm and i'll show you in a second what it looks like and we'll cut it together it doesn't matter what i do there's always a bit of a browning of my walnuts the good news about my walnuts is that they look really really dark but actually it's just the skin because they were skinned well not so yay before i show you this deliciousness let me just quickly thank my patrons because without their support i wouldn't be able to make videos and then share them for free for everybody to learn new things about keto make educated decisions about their health so thank you guys so much so in that sense they're not just our patrons but they are patrons of all of our audience because they are the ones who allow us to bring you videos if you would like to see how you can support that what you can support and the kind of perks that you get for that you can check out patreon in a link up here there's one down in the description below and there's a join button here on youtube if that's more convenient to you and if you decide to join thank you so very much because that's what supports the entirety of this channel without any further ado let me show you my lisa walnut bread loft springs it's springs look at the spring can you detach yourself sweetly they make a point of using baking paper i've used it at times this time i haven't the other time i had an either but it wasn't problematic it's okay it's okay could it be much worse there it is let's cut in shall we now remember the walnuts are indicative but they do not mean it's a slice [Music] you really need to wait for it to be properly cooled down because i thought it was cool from the top i can tell that from the bottom it's still a bit warm so this actually springs even more but you can start to tell there are all the lights pockets there and it springs and it's soft and it's gluteny look at these air pockets look at them look at them it's still warm which is nice but if you've ever worked with ceiling mask which these indeed have you need for it to cool down because at that point it has evaporated all the water it has operated everything and it's gonna be proper crunchy and delicious the crust is really crunchy like the water did even better than just baking it on its own did last time up to you if you want to go to that effort again thankfully my walnuts the blackness is just the skin like when you go on the other side it doesn't and this is how your loaf looks on the inside with your walnuts around and all the spring pockets it's very similar to farmhouse bread so it is thicker than like sandwich bread but it's still as soft as regular bread rather than the keto breads that we're used to even the soda bread which admittedly i love and adore i came up with it and i'm still very happy with it but this has that softness more of proper sandwich or in the direction of sandwich that soda bread is not quite the thing so the bread is that thick bread that you make croutons out of these you can make sandwich with right if you have any questions feel free to come to the facebook group show us your bread or ask any question there are probably around three thousand people now that collectively have a thousand years or something of experience of quito for a long pond if you found this video useful maybe share it with a friend and show them what they can make if they just get some lids of bread mix and some water and they mash them together and then they have two hours to spend less share this video with them and if this video was useful to you specifically maybe consider putting a thumbs up maybe even subscribe to the channel and at that point if you subscribe why wouldn't you ring the bell because that way every single time that one of our videos is out you'll be notified so you can come and see me thank you so very much for watching i will see you at the next video 20 seconds club what is your lisa favorite i have a hard time i saw that they actually have new stuff now i i was uh trying to order and i started on top of toasty they have pre-baked rolls basically they're slightly higher in carbs but i'm gonna order a couple and test them and then i want to try to make the golden rules but in a loaf and then i'm going to do the other normal broth and then they have the mug breads now and those i have but i haven't tried yet can you believe that you know i'm sorry i'm going to work on it which one should i do next let me know", "pFfLdT9fZao": "hello my keto peeds it's samaya and welcome back to my channel i don't sugarcoat today i'm going to show you guys how to make a delicious keto biscuit so let's get started today's video is sponsored by wholesome provisions they are a company located here in the us and they specialize in making keto friendly products two of which are staples in my keto kitchen and that is their lupine flour and their allulo sweetener blend go on their website today and check out their catalog of products i am certain there is something on there for everyone from their pre-made products to their baking good products i'll leave a link in the description of this video to their website now let's jump into today's recipe so today we are going to begin by adding all of our dry ingredients into our food processor and i'm using a food processor because i feel like it's the easiest way to go to do these biscuits however you can do this in a bowl um and you would need either two forks to cut in the butter or you would need a dough cutter i find doing it in a food processor makes it so much easier and i just prefer it that way so we're going to be doing this in the food processor today i'm going to begin by adding 1 cup of lupine flour to this i'm going to be adding one and a quarter cup plus two tablespoons of wheat protein isolate and the reason why i'm using this is because it really cuts down on the carb count but also it just really helped to make this recipe so spectacular um i'm not sure if you can use another type of um protein powder i haven't tried it yet so this is what i'm going to be using today and now i'm going to be adding 2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten and this is important because it really does help with the texture of the biscuits now i'm going to be adding two tablespoons of some buttermilk powder and this is going in more for flavor than anything else because the lupine flour and the wheat protein isolate and i'm using the 8 000 version of the wheat protein isolate um both of those have very distinctive taste so you kind of need to mask those flavors if you want it to you know really taste like a biscuit so adding that buttermilk powder is going to be one of the key things to helping with the flavor so you don't want to skip that now i'm going to be adding three tablespoons of some baking powder and you heard me right three tablespoons so this i'm going to be adding one teaspoon of the allulo sweetener blend here and then i'm going to be adding one teaspoon of salt and now we want to go ahead and give this a quick couple of pulses so that way it can mix all of this up okay to this i'm going to add in a whole stick or a half a cup of some cold cubed butter okay and now i have some what i like to call faux uh keto buttermilk which is just made with some non-dairy milk and some um vinegar and i'll leave a link to the recipe so you can know exactly how to make that i have one cup and then two tablespoons of that right here now before i add this in i'm gonna take the measuring cup that has the two tablespoons and i am going to add in some buttery sweet dough emulsion emulsion emulsion i don't know i always get tongue-tied with that word um i'm adding in one teaspoon of that because it really does help with the flavor of this biscuit and you might think that it's gonna make it really sweet or something but it's really not it's just gonna really help balance out the flavors so i like to add that if you don't have it you can try this recipe without it but if your biscuits taste a little weird it could be because that's missing next i'm going to be adding one and a half teaspoon of some butter extract and again this is all going towards flavor like yeah i just put in the butter but that really doesn't go much towards flavor so these are going in for flavor purposes and so i'm just going to give this a quick little whisk and now that i have this all nice and mixed up i'm going to take this off of here and i'm going to dump this into a bowl and now i'm wanting to make mine um more of a sweet butter biscuit here so i have this um sukran syrup it's gold um i don't know if they have different flavors but that's what this is called and i really like this stuff it works out great when i'm doing like a honey butter or something like that i'm gonna add some of this to my dough here roughly a tablespoon or two and i'm just gonna kind of eyeball that and now with a wooden spoon you want to go ahead and get this nice and mixed together until you have a um a ball of dough formed okay now that our biscuit dough is all nice and mixed and it should look like this a little bit crumbly and not quite together that's completely fine that's how it's supposed to look i'm gonna go ahead and flour my surface with some oat fiber here and i like to use oat fiber because this is a zero net product net carb product i should say and i don't want to add any more extra protein a bunch of extra protein to this so i don't want to use the lupine flour or the um or the wheat protein isolate so that's why i like to add uh uh oh gosh the oat fiber as my flour to use on the surface so let's go ahead and dump our biscuit dough onto our floured surface here and it's okay that it's not together like i said we're gonna work that okay now go ahead and flour your hands because this dough is kind of tacky and that's what it's supposed to be and so now we want to just knead this just a little bit not too much we're just trying to get it to come together we don't want to overwork this or it's not going to give much rise or um the texture won't be as good and so that's about all the kneading that i'm going to do what i want to do now is i'm going to flour my rolling pin and i just want to roll this out we want to keep it shaped like a square and we don't want to roll it too much i like to leave it somewhere between three quarters to one inch thick and then i take it and i fold half of it onto itself and then once again i get it nice and shaped into a rectangle you want to press down a little bit on it to press those layers back together [Music] and then you just want to go ahead and start rolling it yet again and now i'm going to fold it one more time over onto itself now this time around i am not going to um really roll it i don't want to uh um flatten it too much we want to leave these about you want your dough to be about an inch thick so you can get some nice fluffy shaped biscuits okay so get yourself a biscuit cutter cookie cutter whatever and get one that's somewhere between two and three inches i think those make the perfect size and cut into your dough and you just want to press down no need to twist and then pull up and if it doesn't come out it's fine sometimes it comes out sometimes it doesn't that one kind of came out and you want to be want to be careful taking that out of there and just put it on a cookie sheet that's lined with either aluminum foil or some parchment paper i usually use parchment paper but i'm out if you use aluminum foil like i'm using today make sure you spray it with a little oil and if your biscuit is in the biscuit cutter like so just give it a little shake and it'll come out and now what we've done by folding it is we're creating layers with the biscuits and if you get one that's stuck just separate it like so and then just pick it up and put it on to your cookie sheet and so now you just want to reshape your dough don't do too much over working of it we're just going to reshape it don't add any more of the oat fiber to it just get it shaped back into a square as best you can and just continue cutting out your biscuits okay so i've got mine all cut out i made some a little too big and i didn't get my 12 and that's fine and as you can see this biscuit right here is much bigger but i didn't want to waste any of the dough so i just figured i'd make one extra little bigger biscuit here but these normally get 12 so just be careful how you um uh what size biscuit cutter you use and how thick you make them but you should get a solid 12. so what i'm gonna do now is put these in the oven that has been preheating at 425 degrees i'm gonna bake this for roughly 12 to 15 minutes and during that time while this is baking i have a pot on the stove and i am melting six tablespoons of butter with two tablespoons of the um with two tablespoons of this soup green syrup here and i like to add that to the top of my biscuits because i'm going to be using these for breakfast so that is what i'm going to be doing if you are not using these for breakfast go ahead and omit adding this to your butter and you can just top them with butter you can also omit this from the um recipe if you choose however i find that the biscuit is not overly sweet at all like with this in the dough so it tastes like the closest thing to a biscuit using you know like the flowers that we're using so i would still should so i would still suggest adding um one to two tablespoons of this to the dough because as i said it all helps to build the flavor and make for a great tasting biscuit so i will leave that up to you but i would suggest doing it that way and just omitting it for the butter that you're gonna brush on top when 12 to 15 minutes is up brush it with the butter and then bake them for an additional three to five minutes until they are golden brown and take them out of the oven i'll be back when these are done so you guys can see what they look like my biscuits are out and they are done and they look simply amazing and they smell fantastic now these got just a touch darker than what i wanted them to because of the sweet butter that i had on them but that is totally fine it is going to taste great now i'm not kidding you this is the best biscuit i have had since i've been on keto i have been working on a biscuit recipe for the last year and each one got better and better and better but this one this is the one that takes the cake for me so i hope you guys love this recipe they look so good and they taste so amazing and even though it's totally outside of my eating window i'm gonna try one of these on camera for you guys i'm totally using you guys as an excuse to eat one of these biscuits okay so i'm just gonna pop that right on out of there if you can see in the camera above look at that biscuit now i'm gonna cut it open and see if you guys can get a good look at the texture look at the way the knife goes through that biscuit just so well i'm doing a poor job of cutting it sorry but look at that texture that texture is simply amazing it is amazing now i like to have a little butter on my biscuit so that's what i'm gonna do i totally should not be doing this now i'm just gonna put this baby back together and pick it up and get a little bite oh baby um oh sit down little moose oh go sit down go go sorry if you can hear my dog walking around oh my goodness this is simply the best biscuit i've had on keto i'm not kidding you you guys are gonna love these this is delicious it's perfect warm oh boy i'm i'm not kidding this is a biscuit every single thing that i put into it to create this flavor it i'm telling you you can't miss anything the only thing i would suggest not doing is if you really don't want that little bit of sweetness don't add the extra sweetener syrup to the butter that you're gonna put on top but definitely add it to the dough because it makes all the difference in masking those strong flavors of the lupine flower and the wheat protein isolate it just oh this is a biscuit i know you guys are gonna love this one and i'm glad i waited until i got to this specific recipe here before introducing you guys to a biscuit recipe because the one before was good the one before that was okay the other two aren't worth mentioning but this one this is the one so i hope you guys give this recipe a try i hope you guys love this recipe because it is simply amazing i'm going to leave the nutritional facts for this in the description of this video by the way if you don't use all the butter on your um biscuits be sure to subtract that from your macros i'm going to keep the six tablespoons of butter in the recipe but you might not want to put as much you might want to add all of it it's up to you just adjust it however you see fit but that's going to be it for me today you guys so if you like this video go ahead and press that like

by advance global and asking ourselves what the [ __ ] is that [Music] alright so wouldn't be a show if we didn't have a kitty and there she is this is my kitty panda always joining us always welcome all right there we go got ourselves some panda action this is my cat pandora and today we are checking out cbd smokes by vance global these are pretty amazing actually so these cbd smokes are actually 100 hemp flour uh and they're actually impressively good so i'll start off by saying uh my girlfriend was trying to quit smoking and she tried a whole bunch of different uh cbd types of smokes uh she tried uh god pure pure hemp i think it was and post eog's oink and uh apart from being uh really stupid looking uh they weren't quite as enjoyable as i expected don't get me wrong i'm i enjoyed them more than i would a cigarette that's for sure but uh they weren't anything too amazing to me and she didn't love them either in fact she would uh dump out the flour inside and re-roll them in a good paper one cool thing about these ones is they seem to already be in a cool hemp wrap paper uh it's actually uh really nice um i don't know i'm pretty impressed with them overall they smoke good pretty easy draw on them too uh some of these uh smokes cbd smokes i've tried are really hard to hit actually and uh burn quite funny uh but these seem to be very very good um one thing i have noticed and uh i didn't know at first was uh how much like pot these were gonna smell like these smell like i just lit up a joint it kind of smells and tastes like a really really good old school but it smells like it anyway taste wise it's very mellow and uh i don't know man it's not hot but it's very very close uh the taste and smell are very very close and uh i personally think that bees scratch more of a pot itch than a cigarette itch perhaps it feels a little bit more like smoking a joint and it definitely smells it so as a word of warning i will say i didn't know what to expect so i cracked one of these open and uh went uh and smoked a cereal in fact i think i smoked one or two first and didn't realize it because i was probably smoking in the house already smell like pot so i go into the car brand new car i had to get to or a brand new [ __ ] bucket that i had to get because my car anyway regardless i mean a pretty new car has a uh doesn't smell like anything i'm smoking one of these with the windows cracked uh it's cold as [ __ ] it's denver but um i get out of the car and i come back in and it smells like i just clam baked this [ __ ] car and i'm like wow i don't know if that would be good to do again another thing to keep in mind is they do go out uh like a joint or like uh you know smokes back before they would add the rings and whatever the chemicals to keep them smoking so i think that's a good sign that they go out and uh it's nice to be able to light them again but so a couple of the things that have stood out to me is these hemp papers are actually really good and when you're looking at the smokes before you light them it looks like just nugs in there they're actually pretty to look at too i aesthetically i dig the unbleached paper with the black i think that's nice it just looks nice and i think aesthetics are a huge thing especially if you really care about what you're rolling and what you're smoking so right from another planet very good um another cool thing i thought was that the butts are biodegradable and kind of eco-friendly apparently the packaging and even the the sealant of the packaging all biodegradable eco-friendly i'm like that's cool and nowadays that's usually the cheaper option anyways do it that way so i prefer saving a dollar and being eco-friendly or even if it does cost a little bit more it's still a benefit in my eyes either way right now i'm smoking the piers uh very awesome very good 150 milligram cbd prevents because uh these are called dances each smoke you know you smoke a vans which is super high and that's really high the milligrams of cbd per smoke uh compared to everything else i've seen so awesome great um i will also be checking out these these are the herbal blend uh because it's a hundred milligram cbd in these ones per vance uh per smoke and uh these are a little different i can't get enough of these ones and they also have these delta eights these delta eights i'm so impressed with and so happy with and i get so many questions asking me about delta eight that i'm gonna do its own video so very soon here i'm gonna be doing a what the [ __ ] is this with delta eight but before we get into that these two uh i really really dig these i would say for anybody who's into smoking pot these are your go-to you know substitution this is the closest thing to you know [Music] so if you're looking for a substitution or something that smokes almost identical to a joint i would definitely do these great wraps they smell great awesome so this all natural blend is a little different though very good but other than just hemp these ones here have a natural herbal organic blend these ones while still smelling like pot quite a bit uh are like herbal um it's not nearly as dank as these ones these have a more i don't know if you've ever smoked cloves but that's more similar to the smell that you get in the taste and feeling these are also a little bit harsher which if you smoke cigarettes you're kind of looking for that just a little bit of bite with it these are so [ __ ] smooth like i said it's like smoking a great joy no problem these guys a little bit different uh hints of maybe a little bit of clove is what it reminds me of sweetgrass hemp whatever it is they really did it pretty good and these ones burn a lot slower they got that same hemp wrap and they got the same black filters again i dig them and these ones scratch that cigarette itch much more than these ones dudes were nice enough to send me these to sample them out and try them out and uh i couldn't be happier with them honestly like i said i'm gonna be doing a video on these by themselves because they deserve them so i'd have to say that these ones here are by far the best cbd smokes i have found by quite a bit and uh you know thanks to my girlfriend we actually tried quite a few in the last six months or so so i have a pretty good solid range of smokes to you know judge them on and i'm still quite satisfied with them uh i also am very interested they sell the actual nugs the flour and uh that looks really good and cool too so definitely interested in trying some other products if you're interested in trying some other products you can go ahead and use the code venom at the discount and uh yeah use that coupon code and save yourself 20 at the [ __ ] cart so awesome on that uh these guys are doing it right and uh yeah it's actually uh nice to have something to smoke in between smoke and pot i also love uh having something to smoke with uh i have family members and stuff who like to smoke a little bit of weed but not get blasted and they have been really digging these too and uh like i said they've been asking me about that [ __ ] and i didn't know how to say you know i don't know if they're really worth getting getting into these whole cbd smoke lines like i said uh post eog let me down with his sheboygan um these ones however completely restored my faith in cbd smokes look for a video here soon on these delta eights and uh because these ones [ __ ] are really cool and like i said i get a lot of questions on these alone alright thank you very much for watching until next time

you should be fairly familiar with some of them some of the methods and you probably do something without even realizing for your own performance so most athletes compete in our high level used dietary supplements so these are the actual and nutritional we spoke like Michael Phelps consumed in 12,000 calories this is a nutritional aid that calories themselves that he's consuming are fueling his performance and fueling his training nutrition awareness is key for fraf lease and now there's a lot more advance than than it was all the knowledge that athletes have if even when you just watch some of the football documentaries and players talk about their pre-match diet or just their general Dyer sort of in the 90s or before that perhaps even a bit later their diet was was terrible not just alcohol consumption but generally the queen match meals have able to consume fry hours for example and it took people like arson Venga and foreign coaches to come over and implement more nutritionally sound programs for for footballers in this this would have happened in other sports as well so pre event meals and these are key for performance for endurance athletes they're going to be different for endurance athletes as so they're gonna be for strength athletes and you might have to make adaptations for athletes who are in between as well enjoy at least the Train moderate intensity for an hour per day it's recommended that 5 to 7 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight are consumed there's quite a lot of of carbohydrates even if you consumed if you're I mean I'll use a hundred kilogram athlete as an example that's obviously a heavy athlete so that would be when 2,000 calories kilo calories per day of carbohydrate which is a lot anything probably for another 400 kg athlete your total daily energy expenditure that would be around 3000 4000 Silas a large percentage of your calories coming from carbohydrates but because you are training you're going to be burning those those carbohydrates member each carbohydrates gram of carbohydrate has 4 kilocalories of energy fresh leads training at a high intensity for four hours per day you can double that the 10 grams to 12 grams per kilogram and suggests you suggested there's not going to be many athletes and there will be training for four hours a day I'm gonna add nearly a pendulum of performance and sport so recommended carbohydrate intake for an 80 kg athlete training day training moderately for one hour per day we've got some results here so that'd be 400 grams of carbohydrate so I'll give you sixteen hundred kilo calories worth of energy so when we looked at daily recommended percentages of macronutrients and we looked at 55% carbohydrate this might increase for athletes because those recommendations that were given if for just general people and when we look at leads because they need carbohydrates for training and for performance their carbohydrate intake might go up and generally though that general calorie intake will increase as well because they're moving more they require more energy we look at 10 grams per kilogram you look on a hundred grams worth carbohydrate three thousand two hundred kilo tons which is huge a huge amount of energy but remember you're going to be burning that I've just given me the answers to those questions so a pre-event meal should be consumed three hours before an event with an endurance performer consume and slow digesting carbohydrates low glycemic index so they release energy over time porridge homeopathy beans green very good example around one to four grams per kilogram of body work she didn't she and again this will be specific to that individual based on their weight based on its honor and it's based on the event that they're performing this will maximize quite can you stores and prevent go interpretation even if you only taken one gram per kilogram newer 80 kilos of the 80 grams of carbohydrates and that would there would be a fair amount of energy to provide provide you even again it depends what you're good if you're gonna do a marathon you're gonna need more energy even eat more carbohydrates if you're doing a half marathon or we'll see you're not need as much and if you're doing something like a 5k you're probably not gonna need to roll to much of a pre-event meal particularly in those quantities so prevent no one once twice before now so the previous on the three hours before now we're looking at one still ass before she'll be consumed once two hours prior to the event should be a smaller faster digesting milk to top up workers in stores and maintain blood glucose levels bagel energy bar or toast and jam of the world well athlete must be careful not to consume glucose just before an event as this may erase glucose levels and cause rebound - both senior so when we do consume a sugary snack such as a bagel same from sample white bread bagel lot of insulin is released to store the carbohydrate in that bagel now so much instant is released as some of this stays in the blood so therefore is constantly removing glucose from our blood system from my blood vessels and therefore a blood glucose becomes low therefore you might feel a little bit of faint lightheaded so it's important that we don't have that higher sugar or higher glycemic index carbohydrate just before performance there's a baby okay during the post event its carbohydrate absorption so during the event the body can absorb around one gram of carbohydrates per minute it's recommended that a fleet see poppy for longer than now are consumed small amounts of fast digesting carbohydrates 30 to 60 grams this helps to maintain blood glucose and preserve glycogen while you see people when they're doing a man-friend for example carrying gel was graphics in glucose gels jelly babies or something is glucose based around with them but remember your body can only absorb a certain amount per minute so what one gram per minute so you wouldn't want to be consuming too much it would be counter active who would benefit you before if you in too much glycemic index rating scale indicating how rapidly a cola haja affects the glass and glass in McKean Dex essentially indicates how quickly and the food you're consuming will raise your blood sugar levels if it's higher glycemic index were raising quickly if it's a low glycemic index it would it will lower it it will increase it at a lower rate and you've got a glycemic load as well which because obviously you don't always be just carbohydrates you eat a meal and when you have proteins and you have facts within that middle looking you can change the the glycemic index of the food application it's a team sports players racquet sports athletes and triathletes may use glucose tablets gels bananas or sports drinks in breaks of playoff stoppages carbohydrate intake for sports activity last in less than 45 minutes is not required you've got that you've got the glucose to glycogen within your body to last 45 minutes oh and a half of football a half of rugby for example you will be flying you can refuel at halftime which spread most players the post-event post-exercise recovery is helped by consuming 1 to 1.5 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight this should be pitching within 30 minutes of exercise and repeated it to our into Lucy's friend Jonas athlete remember you're probably thinking why we're not pursuing in protein straight after you would want to consume protein as well to help repair but because this is for an endurance athlete and we know we can only store a limited amount of off glycogen we can store about 100 grams in the liver and frita it's a 500 depending on the size of the individual within our muscles and you're using that if you're working on motor intensity you're going to use that coefficient so it's important we're going to train the next day or but they are after all we're going to compete in a few days that we put that glycogen who goes back into our body there you die so you can have your goat doing this if you want map out your pre event three hours before your pre event once two hours before you're going to do join the event and post event in terms of glycogen and glucose our hydrates for endurance athletes so stroke trained now we're looking at strength training athletes at shot puts his weight lifters spring sister the Glee when athletes aim to build muscle and increase trim this requires a different diet to enjoy athletes strength athletes could include bodybuilders chocolates as weight lifters NFL players in some positions rugby players you could consume and and this you'll see lots of different things on the internet and this is what this is specifically what is suggested within the a-level specification for PE it's not necessarily my opinions on my views but this is what you will need to write feed for you for your answers so 5 to 6 mils consumed every few hours so your digestive system is constantly working up to 30% protein in daya so increasing our protein intake because if you remember from before it was 15% for an average person we can increase it to 30% for strength back because we need to repair muscle and build muscle complex carbs to release energy slow leads if your workouts control blood sugar and minimal storage of fat for example I'd be good there so you want complex carbohydrates that gradually release that energy limit of fighting taper fat will provide energy and aid hormone production et flaxseeds when we can't get energy for fat really low intensities anyway so a lot of these athletes wouldn't be working at those intensities so perhaps wouldn't be burning pre-mapped pre-training milk 36 minutes before training a small meal will equal fast digesting carbohydrates and protein should be consumed EG or white bagel and poached egg that we can see in protein before performance if it's strength training if it's a gym session then the silence there was that the body first start to rebuild as you're breaking it down and so the quicker that you can rebuild your body again the quickly you're able to train again post training milk as soon as possible no with fast suggesting carbs and protein should be consumed this will replenish glycogen so again with replacing the glycogen and will put in protein into our body to help repair muscle tissue but again you'll see different different research and you'll see different opinions as to how quickly you need to get that protein into your body you'll see some people in the gym literally rush in to drink their protein straight after their workout because they're worried that the workouts gonna be a waste of time if they don't do that but realistically you can probably you probably got a feeding window about now or maybe more again go and have a look at some some research on that while my nappy favorite liquid form of carbs and protein certainly from protein point of view it's a lot more convenient to have a protein shake you can literally just add water to some powder drink it and you get 20 to 40 grams of protein depending on the shape you're using and the amount using was know everyone has it time to go home cook a chicken breast you know cook scrambled eggs bubble assays convenience really and it's quite cheap very cheap that in fact protein shakes and they taste good a you to taste or rule quickly when I talk about glycogen Logan now you see several different types of reaction loading are action loading is essentially trying to increase the glycogen stores within our body before a big event now you'll see lots of different methods of glycogen loading and you see a called carbohydrate load not carb loading as well the methyl we're gonna look at is a seven-day method and you might not see much research on it if you actually google carb loading you'll see freedom efforts six-day methods even one they methods but we're gonna look at a seven-day one here and this should be the sort of answer that you provide or at least give the four sections that we're going to talk about now so I'm pay one or the first stage of glycogen loading you should complete glycogen with strenuous exercise so whether that's on a treadmill on a bike you will exercise at suitable intensity to deplete the glycogen to remove the glycogen from your body so essentially you're running on empty we like driving a car until there's no picture on it over days two to three or the second stage you will consume high protein and high fat so you're not replacing that glycogen within the body quite yet you're still starving your body of carbohydrate essentially pay for further glycogen deplete in exercise just to make sure if there is any blockage in the body bodies we converted a substance that you're removing that glycogen from your body day four and then say days five to six stage four you consume a high carbohydrate diet while training at a reduced intensity or type of training and that's going to be the same for your training in in days two three and four as well you won't be able to train at the same intensity if you don't have that glycogen carbohydrate in your body and so therefore you'll have to taper your training okay when you haven't got that carbohydrate in your body or your body increases the amount of enzymes that will absorb glycogen okay so when you finally do eat a carbohydrate your body's going to absorb more of it and you see that's that there it says that you can result in 50% more glycogen storage for competition this can massively increased performance it says you've got more fueling your body or more fuel that will workout higher intensity it's only required for athletes that were exercising for more than 90 minutes it can delay exhaustion by 30% and reduced time by two to three percent that might not sound like a lot two to three percent but in terms of a man fan that's huge that could be the difference between a sub four or winning or losing whatever it might be okay so glycogen loading go and have a look at other methods some researchers suggested you can do the same thing within one day this is the seventh a method or four stage method there you will need to give information on in your exam", "HJtaU6XDl98": "Welcome to keto meals and recipes dot com. Special holidays and family gatherings are very busy time for us. So, today I will be showing you how to prepare an extremely easy and flavorful sweet sriracha glazed ham and that, of course, is keto, sugar-free and gluten-free. This is one of the easiest and most fool-proof recipes I have ever made and while, at the same time, it's a real crowd-pleaser. So, let's keep the secret between you and me and never admit how easy it was to make. Just smile and let your guests think that you went to a lot of effort, just for them. And, by the way, if you have people who have specific dietary needs, such as they're diabetic, or don't like sugar, or need to be gluten free for whatever reason, this is a perfect recipe to serve. I'd also like to ask you to please watch the entire video, right to the end, because I will be providing a few suggestions of what you can do with the leftovers. And also, if you don't want to use up all the leftover glazed ham right away, I'll explain how to freeze it. So, don't get intimidated because this seems to be a large ham, even if you're just cooking for one or two people. There are so many things you can do with this ham and, by cooking it once, you'll have multiple meals. To help you decide what size serving you can have, the macronutrient ratio for the sweet sriracha ham Is 1.1 to 1 with 1.5 gram of total carbs, 0.1 gram of dietary fiber, resulting in only 1.4 grams of net carb per serving. And, because the carbs are so low for this ham, this is really great because you can also enjoy a slice of my pumpkin pie or my no-bake keto pumpkin pie mousse. You can be totally guilt-free, and within your carb count. So, this takes care of the entree and the dessert. And, the last thing you have to do is choose what side dishes you want with it. To make this easy, keto glazed ham which, by the way, has a very sweet but slightly hot and spicy taste all at the same time, first preheat your oven to 360 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius. And, the next step is to prepare your sweet sriracha glaze. All you have to do for this is put your unsalted butter into your small sauce pan, add the sweetener, in this case I'm using my Lakanto gold monk fruit-based sweetener. I use this all the time. But, I'd like to recommend it because it doesn't leave an aftertaste. And, some non-keto people may not like the taste of some of the other sweeteners, like stevia. Next, to the pot also add your cinnamon powder, the nutmeg powder, if you have freshly grated, that's best, and, of course you need your sugar-free sriracha sauce. That's all there is to making the glaze. Then, place the pot on your stovetop, which is set to medium-low heat, and cook at a very low simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sweetener has melted and if you rub it between your two fingers, it doesn't feel gritty. At this point, just remove the pot from the stove top and let it cool to room temperature. But, do stir it once in a while. There's two ways you can make this ham. First, I will explain how to make the oven method. Coat the bottom of the roasting pan or dutch oven, as I'm using, with about two or three tablespoons of your sweet sriracha sauce. And, just spread it where you will be placing the ham. For this recipe, I'm going to use a bone-in, smoked, spiral cut piece of ham. And, the reason I'm choosing the spiral cut because the nice even spiral cuts look really great when you're serving, and, because it makes preparing and serving the ham much easier. So, place your spiral cut ham into the middle of the pan and, using a pastry brush, very generously coat and cover the entire surface of your ham with this glaze. And, it's also important to glaze the front of the ham. Then, look over your ham and touch up any spots you might have missed. Now we're going to use the remaining glaze to lightly brush the inside leaves or sections of the ham, starting from the outer, fatter end and working towards the narrow part of the ham. I separate the pieces about two at a time, and taking my pastry brush and lightly brushing the glaze over the entire inside surface. I brush every two sections for a milder taste. But, if I want a much stronger sweet sriracha taste, then I actually coat every single section. I press the pieces together to reposition the sections so they're touching and tightly back together. This will prevent the individual sections from drying out. Now it's time to place your glazed ham in the lower third position of your preheated oven. And, set your timer for 45 to 60 minutes. Individual baking time will depend on the thickness of the leg. Some legs are longer and leaner. Others are shorter and thicker. So, you have to adjust your time accordingly, because what you're trying to do is to heat up the entire ham all the way through. And, this baking time will allow for the sweet sriracha glaze to flavor your ham. When the time goes off and your ham is done, remove the ham from the oven and you can serve it immediately. Or, if you're serving it a little later and want to keep it warm, cover the pot very tightly with aluminum foil. Now for the slow cooker method. Before coating your ham, place two or three tablespoons of the glaze on the bottom of your slow cooker pot and then coat as described above. Place the glazed ham into your slow cooker, cover with the lid, and set your timer on low for either four to six hours. That is all there is to making either of these two methods. Now, wasn't that easy? One more thing you should know about this recipe: You can make this a day or two ahead and serve the ham cold, or just heat it up for about 15 minutes in the oven before serving. Depending on how many people you're serving, you may or may not have leftovers, but here are a few ideas how you can use any of the tasty leftover ham. For example, you can take a serving of ham, cut it up into little cubes, and use it to make my ham and cheddar egg muffins. The sweetness of the sriracha glaze on the ham adds an extra layer of flavor to these easy, prep ahead egg muffins, which you can keep in your fridge for five to six days. Or, you can use a serving of this ham to make a ham and cheese sandwich. I really like making it with my walnut sandwich bread, but you could also make it with my easy keto buns and rolls. Or, you can use my pita recipe and make a wrap. All you have to do is use a bit of ham lettuce, cucumber, tomato or whatever you like in your wrap. And, the sandwich and buns, as well as the wrap, make wonderful lunches to take along for school or work. One last suggestion, if you want a one pot meal, is make my green bean casserole, and then add a cup or two of the sweet sriracha ham, and toss it all together. The green bean casserole and the ham are really good together. But, if you don't want to use up all of your ham in the next few days, all you have to do to freeze this Is cut the sections off the bone and place them into single serving or however many servings you need for your family. Separate the slices with a sheet of parchment. Then, place each serving into a freezer tight container and don't forget to date and label. To thaw, just take it out the night before, put it in the fridge and you can heat it up in a frying pan or use it cold. Whatever you prefer. And this is how a large ham can be used to either serve a big crowd or make many, many meals over the week and also have some frozen prep ahead meals. And, I hope this very easy recipe will make your holiday meal prep much easier, so that you can spend more time with your guests and family.

whilst cornering the initial approach fix on this approach is a bit similar to ils ilsy or loc rwy19 at jackson poll is tuned manually the vor is switched into primary egi source with the nws command its course is set the flight plan remains on the background cycling back to egi and resetting the fd ates frequency is tuned with the preset the self-contained approach stores preset setups here the frequency and course is reviewed for the ils 19 approach a rule of thumb distance for a 90 degree turn is 0.5 of ground speed the turn is initiated a bit too early here and an overshoot follows [Music] a better option would have been to set a manual course line and follow it before selecting bohr mode a destination waypoint could have been created for the terminal fix because they aren't supported the sda approach is activated so a reciprocal heading to runway is set because of later circuit so a better implementation of the half percent rule is executed in capturing the localizer so so so [Music] [Music] lowering the gear brings up the aoa symbol in a bracket top of it is slightly fast and vice versa maximum speed for 60 flaps is 230 knots 210 knots per hundred percent with the gear down the final approach speed for the current configuration is automatically shown it's 160 knots for 1000 pounds of fuel or less one knot per pound for above that so so if you use a three degree glide silk delay easy back on the throttles rate of descent are to be less than 500 fpm on touchdown in goal rounds after touchdown lower the nose from landing attitude here maintain at least 200 knots in the crossfit turn the island on the horizon is about 1.5 miles from the runway center line the yellow line is the final turn speed the green line is the computed final approach speed the overhead approach begins at 300 knots and usually 1500 agl the hud can be decluttered as desired the ground track feature is utilized which can be handled in crosswinds as well back to 60 degrees maintain level flight throughout the turn as the wings are being leveled extend the gear at 1.5 g max back to the first approach in the perch position at 45 degrees from the runway roll into a bank up around 45 degrees place the flight path marker into about 5 degrees dive maintain on speed aoa minimum adjust bank angle pitch and power for proper positioning it's very easy to exceed full flap limiting so be aware of your air speed a nifty way to approach is using a shallower glide path of about 2.5 degrees use the pitch ladder for that and or the three reds on the lights aiming for the

[Music] in a go round retract the speed brake first lower the nose into less than 10 degrees pitch retract the flaps to 60 percent and use max thrust if necessary another form of sca is a form of

delicious, low-carb peanut butter bars are\u00a0\na wonderful after dinner treat, a snack anytime\u00a0\u00a0 or, as my sons do from time to time, an alternative\u00a0\nbreakfast to eggs and bacon. Because I'm sure\u00a0\u00a0 that you will love it, especially if you love\u00a0\nReese's peanut butter cups which, by the way,\u00a0\u00a0 I have made into keto. Or, as an alternative,\u00a0\nyou could also try my peanut butter fudge.\u00a0\u00a0 But, if you like peanut butter, please leave me a\u00a0\ncomment in the description below and tell me what\u00a0\u00a0 other recipes you'd like me to make that would\u00a0\nsatisfy your peanut butter craving. Since all my\u00a0\u00a0 videos are instructional, as I'm making this recipe,\u00a0\nI will also give you tips on what you can do to\u00a0\u00a0 substitute specific ingredients, and also how to\u00a0\nstore these, short term and long term. Keep watching!\u00a0\u00a0 One last thing: I would like to mention that\u00a0\nthis recipe was adapted from John Kanell of\u00a0\u00a0 Preppy Kitchen, so I give him full credit for the\u00a0\ninterpretation I have implemented for my recipe.\u00a0\u00a0 A link to his original recipe will be posted in\u00a0\nthe description below. If you like my channel and\u00a0\u00a0 find value in what I do, and would like to support\u00a0\nme, all I ask is that you please watch the video\u00a0\u00a0 to the end, and then like leave a comment. And, if\u00a0\nyou haven't done so already, please subscribe. I'd\u00a0\u00a0 be so honored to have you on board. And, when you\u00a0\nsubscribe, remember to ring the bell, scroll down\u00a0\u00a0 to \"notify all.\" This way, you'll be notified when I\u00a0\npost my next video. Now, the macronutrient ratio for\u00a0\u00a0 these keto no bake peanut butter bars is 4.1 to 1,\u00a0\nwith 7.2 grams of total carbs, 3.4 grams of dietary\u00a0\u00a0 fiber, resulting in only 3.8 grams of net carbs\u00a0\nper quite substantial size bar. Now, to begin with,\u00a0\u00a0 there are a couple steps you should do. First, line\u00a0\neither a 9 by 9 inch or about 22 centimeter by 22\u00a0\u00a0 centimeter square cake pan, or alternatively you\u00a0\ncould use two 9 inch or 22 centimeter loaf pans. It doesn't matter which pan you use, but line\u00a0\nthem with parchment paper, which will make it much\u00a0\u00a0 easier to remove from the pan. Unfortunately, since\u00a0\nwe can't just go to a store and buy keto cookies\u00a0\u00a0 without a lot of other substances in them, and I\u00a0\ndon't really find them truly keto, I would like to\u00a0\u00a0 suggest you make a batch of my sugar cookie\u00a0\ndough which, by the way, is very easy to make.\u00a0\u00a0 You will need only about half of the\u00a0\ncookie dough and, once you've made it,\u00a0\u00a0 divide it into two. And, after dividing, place one of\u00a0\nthe halves between two sheets of parchment paper,\u00a0\u00a0 and roll out to about a quarter to a third of\u00a0\nan inch thick. You don't have to do any cutouts\u00a0\u00a0 or anything like that. Just leave it as a complete\u00a0\nsheet and put it onto your baking sheet. Then, just\u00a0\u00a0 bake according to the directions. So I don't have\u00a0\nto keep repeating, for any recipe that I mention,\u00a0\u00a0 a link will be posted in the description below, as\u00a0\nwill the link for the written peanut butter bar\u00a0\u00a0 recipe. So go down there for anything I refer to.\u00a0\nWhen your cookie sheet is done, grab the parchment\u00a0\u00a0 and slide it onto a cooling rack and let it cool\u00a0\ncompletely to room temperature, before you crumble\u00a0\u00a0 it. The cookie can easily be crumbled between your\u00a0\nfingers, but you could also use a food processor.\u00a0\u00a0 The only thing I'd like to mention is\u00a0\njust remember, when you're crumbling\u00a0\u00a0 either by hand or by food processor, to keep the\u00a0\ncrumbs rough and irregular, but not too big, and\u00a0\u00a0 definitely not too fine. When you're done, measure\u00a0\nout the crumbs and set aside. Next, melt the\u00a0\u00a0 unsalted butter and pour it into a large mixing\u00a0\nbowl. To this mixing bowl, add your peanut butter.\u00a0\u00a0 Using a hand blender, mix until well integrated.\u00a0\nAt this point, also add your powdered confectionery\u00a0\u00a0 sweetener, and mix again until smooth and well\u00a0\ncombined. Here's my first tip: if you don't like\u00a0\u00a0 peanut butter, or if you want a change of pace but\u00a0\nthe same effect, this recipe also tastes amazing\u00a0\u00a0 if you use almond butter, or any other nut butter\u00a0\nof your choice. As well, you could use seed butters\u00a0\u00a0 in place of the peanut or other nut butters.\u00a0\nAnother favorite we have is combining tahini\u00a0\u00a0 with peanut butter, blending them together to\u00a0\nequal the same quantity as per the peanut butter,\u00a0\u00a0 and using that instead of pure peanut butter.\u00a0\nAnd, if you want a crunchy version, just use a\u00a0\u00a0 crunchy peanut butter or crunchy almond butter.\u00a0\nOr, chop up some nuts and throw them in yourself.\u00a0\u00a0 Another thing I feel is very important, and I\u00a0\nwant to emphasize: Whenever you're buying anything\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's marked \"keto\" or \"low carb\" or whatever, read\u00a0\nthe label. Many prepared products have some form\u00a0\u00a0 of sugar. It may not be sugar directly. It may be\u00a0\nmaltose or others. And, they have preservatives\u00a0\u00a0 or gums and thickeners that you don't want. When\u00a0\nyou're reading a label for a peanut butter or\u00a0\u00a0 nut butter, the only ingredient that is listed\u00a0\nshould be the nut itself. Now that my peanut butter\u00a0\u00a0 mixture is ready, the next thing is to pour your\u00a0\ncookie crumbs into the bowl and, using a spatula,\u00a0\u00a0 to fold until everything is well combined. As John\u00a0\nKanell points out in his video, you don't want to\u00a0\u00a0 use a food processor or hand blender to integrate\u00a0\nthe cookie crumbs. If you do that, they'll be mushed\u00a0\u00a0 up and you'll get a paste, and the texture\u00a0\nof the cookie inside the bar will be lost.\u00a0\u00a0 When using peanut butter, another problem\u00a0\nthat I encountered was that, depending on the\u00a0\u00a0 brand, some smooth peanut butters, especially if\u00a0\nthey're organic or freshly ground, result in the\u00a0\u00a0 peanut butter itself being extremely liquidy and\u00a0\nrunny. In this case, all you have to do is add one,\u00a0\u00a0 two, or sometimes even three tablespoons\u00a0\nof a dry flour such as peanut flour,\u00a0\u00a0 coconut flour, lupin flour or almond flour, to\u00a0\nthicken up your peanut butter or nut butter. But,\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to thicken up your peanut butter,\u00a0\njust add one tablespoon at a time, stir it very,\u00a0\u00a0 very well, and then let it rest for five to ten\u00a0\nminutes to be absorbed by the oils in the peanut\u00a0\u00a0 butter, almond butter, or whatever. Now everything\u00a0\nis combined, and it's time to pour this amazing\u00a0\u00a0 mixture into my parchment lined pan. As you can see,\u00a0\nI'm going to use my square silicone, pan today. But,\u00a0\u00a0 you can use any of the ones I've mentioned already.\u00a0\nAnd, that's because I want to make squares today.\u00a0\u00a0 And, at this step, also smooth the surface, then\u00a0\nput the pan into the refrigerator to set for\u00a0\u00a0 30 to 60 minutes. This will help the peanut\u00a0\nbutter set and become a little bit firmer.\u00a0\u00a0 But you're not done yet. So, while you're\u00a0\nwaiting, prepare the chocolate topping. Chop\u00a0\u00a0 up your unsweetened chocolate and put it into a\u00a0\nsmall bowl. Here, I'm using a decent quality baking\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate, but read the label of your chocolate. You\u00a0\ndo not want compound or baker's chocolate, They're\u00a0\u00a0 quite different and they have a lot of other\u00a0\ningredients in there that you don't want. You\u00a0\u00a0 just want unsweetened baking chocolate. And, into\u00a0\nthis bowl, add the peanut butter and the sweetener.\u00a0\u00a0 Put the bowl over your bain marie, or double boiler.\u00a0\nAnd, as everything is melting, stir continuously.\u00a0\u00a0 It should only take a couple minutes, especially if\u00a0\nyou've pre-chopped your chocolate. You should stop\u00a0\u00a0 and remove the bowl from the bain marie when you\u00a0\nnotice that almost all of the chocolate is melted.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, all you have to do is occasionally\u00a0\nstir until the rest of the chocolate is melted. And,\u00a0\u00a0 by removing it at this point, you won't burn your\u00a0\nchocolate. Then, set your chocolate topping aside,\u00a0\u00a0 because it has to be at room\u00a0\ntemperature before using.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, everything is at the right temperature.\u00a0\nNow, for the next step, I got my pan from the\u00a0\u00a0 refrigerator, and it's time to pour the cooled\u00a0\nchocolate mixture over the peanut butter base.\u00a0\u00a0 Try to spread and distribute the\u00a0\nchocolate evenly over the entire surface. You can leave it smooth and flat\u00a0\nlike this, but if you want a design\u00a0\u00a0 just start at one corner and make\u00a0\nshallow back and forth swirly lines,\u00a0\u00a0 as I'm doing here. Now, it's time to return the pan\u00a0\nback to the refrigerator. You want everything to\u00a0\u00a0 set, so you'll have to chill for at least a couple\u00a0\nhours, depending on your refrigerator, or leave it\u00a0\u00a0 to set overnight for best flavor development. When\u00a0\nyou're ready, cut into even squares to make 16 bars.\u00a0\u00a0 You will find that each bar is quite satisfying,\u00a0\nand one or two make a great breakfast substitute,\u00a0\u00a0 because they're not only treaty\u00a0\nbut they're also fat bombs. But, if you're having one of these bars as an after\u00a0\ndinner dessert or treat, I actually find that half\u00a0\u00a0 of a square is just the right size. In order to\u00a0\nmaintain the best taste and texture for these bars\u00a0\u00a0 between servings, leave them in your refrigerator.\u00a0\nThey actually taste best when they're cool. If\u00a0\u00a0 you're wondering what these no-bake peanut\u00a0\nbutter squares taste like, these bars taste\u00a0\u00a0 amazing. They're a very interesting combination\u00a0\nof a Reese's peanut butter cup, combined with a\u00a0\u00a0 wonderful cookie which, of course makes sense,\u00a0\nsince those are the basic ingredients we use\u00a0\u00a0 to make them. Before ending, I have a few last\u00a0\ntips. These keto, no-bake peanut butter squares\u00a0\u00a0 will keep well in the refrigerator for several\u00a0\ndays. Or, if you have the strength of willpower,\u00a0\u00a0 you can also freeze your leftover bars in an\u00a0\nairtight container and, in this way, they will\u00a0\u00a0 keep in the freezer for several months. I hope\u00a0\nyou have found this instructional video useful\u00a0\u00a0 and, if so, please share with someone\u00a0\nthat you think might enjoy this recipe.\u00a0\u00a0 And, most of all, I hope you'll come back and check\u00a0\nout my next video when it's posted. Thank you very\u00a0\u00a0 much for spending the time and watching my\u00a0\nvideo, especially if you made it to the end. Well, I hope you have a wonderful\u00a0\nrest of your day!

those who are uncertain about fuel you can also check some of my previous reviews in the comment box below but it is the king of energy to replacements typically around 40 to 50 stems per serving so on the back is a transparent label there and I kind of like that like I tell all my customers is Kelsey one being one of them who is here visiting for the weekend that you going to a mom-and-pop store paid two and three bucks an energy drink pop into a Giant Eagle Walmart pay 2 to 3 bucks a drink this is nearly a quarter of the amount to get phenomenal flavoring and also fantastic energy fuel highlights a gram and a half of creatine 1.2 grams of beta-alanine one gram of citrulline you have I think 750 milligrams of Kitaen on the back and then there's a mix of cooperating cognitive enhancers such as choline tyrosine recovery with taurine and around 200 milligrams of caffeine some of the previous limited-edition flavors such as white frost and Baja Breeze were 250 milligrams and caffeine Campus proteins went back to the oak geez just like pink burst and some of the newer flavors peach rings and strawberry Kiwi at 200 so it's a pretty happy medium right there so what we're gonna do today we're gonna mix up this bad boy and I'm gonna give you a taste test and also Kelsey is here to kind of chime in as well because sometimes you people think that my reviews are subjective so we're just about to figure out so you can kind of see there's like a little color desperation in there I don't know what's really what was here but whoever got is definitely up to something how's so fruit roll-ups if you're not unfamiliar with it come in multiple flavors of course some for you there yeah I think there's about 14 different flavors of fruit roll-ups so I honestly don't have any clue what to expect as far as how this will taste just by smelling it right so here we go moment of truth flavoured God campus protein everyone watching Cheers yes give it a whirl I get a little bit of cherry I get a little bit of watermelon yeah I get a blue raspberry vibe cherry watermelon maybe a little hint of strawberry on the back end it's definitely an array of fruit roll-ups kind of congealed into one yeah I don't know what room was going for the flavor guide but I tell you what I would put this right up there with papers yeah me too with all of our other flavors on the lineup how would you rank them I would say oh gosh I honestly would put this one first and then pink first and then probably featuring I know your big peach range first mmmm strawberry Kiwi I haven't had these ones yet so I can't speak to that is dry I would have to say yeah yeah I'd have to I don't have to really agree with Kelsey here between one and two this is really up there with pink bars it's a hard choice if you were fan of pink burst you're a fan of fruit roll-ups you guys are not gonna want to miss out on this like I said this is limited edition once it's gone it's gone and this is

a very simple recipe we're gonna make our own dressing to go in it and we're gonna get right into it so you want one large carrot or two smaller carrots and we're gonna grate these up carrot is going to give it a beautiful color the total carbs for this recipe per cup is 2.75 and the fiber is 2 grams so your net carbs is going to be 0.75 so your carb content for this recipe is very low so now we're going to get a cabbage so you want to cut this cabbage in half just going to cut it down the middle so we're going to remove the core [Music] so once the core is removed we're going to slice it [Music] so now we're going to slice it in the opposite direction [Music] so we can add this to the bowl any big pieces of the core you can take out go ahead and cut up the second part off the cabbage try and cut thin strips mine was a little thick a little wide but that's all good whatever you prefer so we're going to get the core out [Music] so we're going to slice thin strips so now we're going to take it and cut it in the opposite direction so we can add this to the bowl [Music] you can go thinner than that if you want it's all preference so whatever you prefer we have a bag of pre-mixed salad and what's in this is mostly broccoli red onion and some cabbage now if you're looking at the carb content on the back of these salads it mostly has to do with the salad dressing and we're not using salad dressing we're going to make our own so don't worry about the carb content on the back because we're only using the vegetables so we're going to use about a cup [Music] or a little more it's up to you see how that's going to give it a beautiful beautiful color so we're just going to mix this all together get the carrots from the bottom so now that we have this all mixed together we're going to start adding our ingredients so we have a quarter teaspoon of celery salt we have a tablespoon of unsweetened almond milk we have a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar [Music] we have an eating quarter cup of mayo so we're going to add some pepper and we're going to use this powdered sweetener [Music] now we're going to mix it all together guys we're going to give this a taste test [Music] it is absolutely perfect it's not too wet a lot of times when you buy coal styles in the store they got way too much mail and dressing added to the coleslaw but this is absolutely perfect and if you prefer it being more wet go right ahead add a little bit more of each and ingredients for your dressing but this is absolutely perfect what a way to be able to get your vegetables in and stay low curb it's only 0.75 net carbs per cup it's absolutely delicious and guys i hope you give this a try leave some comments hit the subscribe button and hit the bell notification and guys we're gonna see you next time", "fTwihPh6CuM": "I can you know little caret fans craving some bread you're in luck because today I'm going to be baking up a quick low carb bread recipe so the first thing you don't want to do for this recipe is pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and then we're going to go ahead and get six eggs now I know what you're thinking it's gonna be pretty eggy but to be honest with you I add enough coconut and almond flour to this recipe where it's really not that bad so go ahead and break those six eggs in here now this is a quick and easy recipe doesn't take long at all probably about five to ten minutes of prep time and forty to fifty minutes of baking and it's not a used bread recipe so you're not going to get that same texture it's a quick bread recipe that's low-carb because we're using the little car flours in this one next we're going to add some butter I like to use 1/2 a cup which is one stick and I used to melt it but I find that if you just let it soften up on counter it's fine [Music] and then I like to blend in some coconut oil and I use three tablespoons of that and if you don't have the liquid kind or if it's not soft you might want to go ahead and melt it a little bit in the microwave or on the stove just so it blends in well so three tablespoons of that and then I add the flowers I've got 1 and 1/3 cup of almond flour and I do like to mix my almond and coconut flour just because I find it provides a better texture when baking then if you just use almond or these issues coconut flour but I am going to be working on a coconut flour only recipe but for this one is going to be a blend so let's put it on Cup third almond flour [Music] and then you have 2/3 cocoa flour and then we're going to use a teaspoon of baking powder and I like to use a mixture of cream of tartar and baking soda because a lot of the baking powders that you buys at store have some corn in it or aluminum so that's about a teaspoon there in fact I'd like to add a half a teaspoon of xanthan gum and xanthan gum is actually a an optional ingredient in this recipe it's something that I like to add to gluten-free baked goods because I find it helps give some of that gummy texture that you kind of miss if you don't have any gluten so I add a half a teaspoon of that and a little bit of salt half a teaspoon in there and I'm using the pink one today and then you're just going to blend it all up in the bowl until it makes a nice [Music] so it is a pretty thick bat especially if you don't melt the butter first and then I've got a prepared loaf pans I use a stone weighing pan it's a 9 by 5 inch regular loaf pan and I don't like to put a sheet of parchment paper in there first because I find that helps with it so that it doesn't stick with the pans and it lifts right out and then I'll go ahead and reach the sides as well so and then you're just going to want to smooth out the top and then put it in a 350 degree oven and then just a little bit on my tongue smooth the top out now it is going to be a thick batter and it's not like a dough so it is more of a fatter than bread so all right that looks like it's good ready to go into the oven so I'm gonna go ahead and pop this in the oven and I like to start it at 40 minutes and then check it you want it to be nice and golden brown on top and then you can do a toothpick test just to make sure that it's fully cooked so let's go ahead and put that in the 350 degree oven you guys set it's 40 minutes okay the bread has been in the oven for a bit little over 40 minutes and I just tested it to be done so let's let it cool for a few minutes and then we'll take it out actually we should just lift it right out of the rack right now and let it cool slightly for a few minutes and then we're gonna go ahead and see how it slices the berth been cooling for about 5-10 minutes and it's still a little bit orange but I think it's okay to slice so let's go ahead put it on the cutting board see how it came out so just slice it up it's actually kind of a shorter low because I made it in a nine by five can if you put it on up in a eight by four pan you'll get a taller though this did come out nice and it is still warm and it's fresh I don't know if you can see that I love warm bread right out of the oven mmm and this one's got a great flavor there it is some fresh-baked low-carb Kito bread go ahead and try this recipe I hope you enjoyed it and if you'd like to see some more recipes from low carb young please subscribe and I'll see you guys again later bye bye [Music] you",

your energy needs throughout the year see if you can answer these four questions about a dietary prescription for athletes number one a dietary prescription for macronutrients considers which - macaroni transfers carbohydrate and protein usually carbohydrate is determined first hydrate needs in grams followed by protein in grams and then feting grams number two the guideline for blank intake is approximately one gram per kilogram body weight per day the answer will be fat so for example if a 135 pound female wanted to determine her recommendation for fat intake she would multiply take her weight in pounds 135 divided by 2.2 to get sixty one point three six kilograms by multiplying by one you get an estimated 61 grams of fat needed for every day discretionary calories our calories that can be empty okay after you've met your knees for carbohydrate fat and protein and we'll look more into that when we go through [Music] our athletic our athlete example number four if an athlete wants to lose body fat what are the simple ways to do so without impacting performance okay well we see here not you can decrease body fat by opting not to consume your discretionary calories you can increase your activity level or you can slightly reduce your fat intake slightly because you reduce reduce your fat intake too much it will compromise the amount of energy that you have and can make getting fat soluble vitamins your diet difficult the fat soluble vitamins a vitamin D vitamin E and vitamin K you this example is taken from your textbook and it walks you through calculating a dietary prescription for a 135 pound non pregnant female athletes B weight of the athlete is giving us 135 pounds that is equivalent to 60 1.4 kilograms of body weight this athlete needs 2500 kilocalories per day in order to sustain her metabolism and physical activity level the recommendation for 6 grams of carbohydrate for every kilogram body weight is given based on this athletes activity level you can determine the number of carbohydrates this athlete needs daily by multiplying 60 1.4 kilograms the body weight by 6 grams of carbohydrate which is needed for every kilogram body weight this equals 368 grams of carbohydrate needed throughout the day ideally spaced out okay you can go a step further and calculate the calories from carbohydrate so we know that this athlete needs 368 grams of carbohydrate and we remember that every gram of carbohydrate provides 4 kilocalories so this is approximately 1472 kilocalories from carbohydrate daily as far as protein the recommendation is 1.2 grams protein for every kilogram body weight so we multiply 1.25 60 1.4 kilograms by weight to get 74 grams protein needed daily we can take that a step further and determine how many kilocalories we need from protein so 74 grams of protein needed daily we multiply that by 4 kilocalories per gram and we get 296 kilocalories from Protein daily and we know that fat is recommended at a rate of 1 gram of fat for every kilogram body weight so 61 grams of fat is needed daily 61 grams of fat equates to 549 kilocalories from fat daily we know that because every gram of fat supplies 9 kilocalories so we multiply 61 grams by 9 kilocalories to get approximately 540 9 kilocalories from fat daily ok this is not going to be an exact amount so when you add up all the kilocalories that together you get 2317 kilocalories you have the option of not consuming the extra 183 discretionary calories or you slice pie or whatever within your calorie limit some tips for weight loss are included and can include activities daily that allow for an increase in energy expenditure such as taking the stairs there are benefits to slow weight loss when weight is lost to rapidly person becomes at risk for gallbladder disease and if it's too rapidly and you may have problems with your skin stretching out for weight gain generally the recommendation is try to increase your calorie intake by 500 kilocalories per day for some people this may be difficult some people are genetically predisposed to be being underweight or lower in weight and appetite can be a real problem for weight gain it is recommend recommended that you increase portion sizes like doubling portions eat frequently and develop an individualized plan eat more meals and snacks daily to gain weight increase the portion of your favorite foods you can reduce intake of beverages that do not provide energy in the form of kilocalories but may give a feeling of fullness such as coffee tea and diet soft drinks some people have reported that sugars eating soft drinks make them hungry increased foods high and heart-healthy fats such as nuts nut butters like almond butter peanut butter increase intake of olives and avocados avocados are an excellent source of potassium and we know now that Americans don't get enough of potassium as we learned in the minerals chapter nutrient-dense food are defined in your textbook and our consider foods that have a relatively high nutrient concentration two kilocalories an example would be skim milk which does have a little fat in it skim milk can be an excellent source of calcium vitamin D phosphorus riboflavin potassium sodium while providing between 80 and 90 kilocalories for sir per serving most fruits and vegetables are nutrient-dense there's some like iceberg lettuce that don't have very many nutrients but don't provide tilaka calories either whole grains like granola granola is a very nutrient dense food and if you're someone who having trouble meeting that calorie needs and are confused especially about carbohydrate try consuming granola with yogurt cereal or milk can be an excellent source of carbohydrate consume a lower fat meats fish poultry and low-fat or nonfat dairy nutrient-dense foods do not necessarily have to be low in kilocalories for example nuts per serving tend to be a high calorie food for every serving fourth my cup but they're rich in minerals by selenium vitamin E the other fat soluble vitamins low nutrient dense foods include sugar and alcohol nutrient density of foods tend to decline with the addition of sugar and fat here is an example of the nutrient density of skim milk compared to the nutrient density of whole milk skim milk an 8 ounce serving of this particular brand provides 91 kilocalories per serving compared to 146 kilocalories provided by whole milk the protein is a little greater and skim milk there is a brand of milk called fair life and there may these some other brands that are high-protein milk that provide proximately 13 grams of protein for every eight ounce serving and contains only about 80 calories an ounce serving of milk contains about 12 grams of carbohydrate the skim milk whole milk contains one less gram the skim milk has less than one gram of fat while whole milk gives you eight and it's mostly saturated fat skim milk has less cholesterol and more calcium and about same amount of iron as whole milk it is important to consume nutrient dense food in your diet in meeting diet planning goals the lowest on the list in terms of nutrient density include white sugar or table sugar also known as sucrose and distilled alcohol 100 proof alcohol 1 fluid ounce white sugar contains 12 grams of disaccharides with all the fast food options that are available and their ability to sell these high caloric foods at low prices it can be a challenge for some people to eat nutritiously sometimes you may find yourself just trying to grab a bite to eat in the midst of all of the busyness of your day it does take some time and effort to put into planning what you're going to eat there are some options at fast food outlets that are viable in terms of making it healthy I always try to access the Nutrition Facts provided by the company's website or you can get it on your phone through an app My Fitness Pal is the one I use the most here's a cheat sheet for healthy us-style eating patterns for adults you can take a quick glance at this chart and see approximately how much is recommended from each food group to give you a provide a certain number of calories you can use myplate.gov also known as choosemyplate.gov to estimate the number of ounces or ounce equivalence you need from any particular case of facts giving a number of teaspoons if you're using the Dietary Guidelines an ounce equivalent of grains would be 1/4 cup of dry beans is equivalent to 1 slice of whole wheat bread that's an ounce equivalent if your calorie levels suggest you need 6 ounce equivalents of grains per day half of your grain service should be whole grains protein foods can include things like seafood meats poultry eggs nuts seeds and soy products try to get a variety you many athletes learn to cook and prepare their own foods it's more economical in a lot of cases for a more nutritious intake at fast food restaurants try to choose a smallest adult meal I'll get a kid's meal if you're trying to stay within your calorie limits and trying to avoid less nutrient-dense foods fried grilled foods instead of fry you can get extra laid out lettuce or extra tomato maybe for substituting mayonnaise you can ask for a light mayonnaise or don't get any mayonnaise at all cut out the cheese or you can share with friend keep in mind if you're eating a sandwich like a Genoa sandwich hoagie style sandwich they can contribute considerable calories 7 800 calories 1,000 calories for a sandwich not a burger in some cases so keep an eye out if you're trying to gain weight deli sandwiches with lots of toppings and that it can be in a good source good way to get more calories in consuming salad is a good way to consume nutrient-dense foods be mindful of the dressings that you use some other choices you can get a plain baked potato I think Wendy's still sells Blake potatoes Pizza can be an option so long as you're not exceeding the number of grams of saturated fat you are allotted in one day whole-wheat pancakes blueberry whole-wheat pancakes they can be a good whole-grain carbohydrates as well as bagels here's an example of a one-day diet plan you can use this as a template to make your own diet for breakfast it may include one cup of bran flakes of cereal we're getting fiber there one banana which is an excellent source of potassium eight ounces are not fat milk which provides vitamin D calcium phosphorus riboflavin and protein orange juice which may be fortified with calcium or can we be replaced with a whole fruit one slice a whole wheat toast with 1 tablespoon of margarine you can get Smart Balance or benek all these are the healthier margarine read the label make sure that there are no partially hydrogenated oils and the type of margarine that you are using for lunch it can consist of tuna salad made from 3 ounce canned tuna in water with 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise there's olive oil mayonnaise that is a not so bad option and you can add celery however you wanna make your tuna salad eat it with a slice of tomato with two slices of whole wheat bread you can add a piece of fruit like a pear another serving of milk make sure you're getting your calcium and a granola bar with oats that can provide fiber folate vitamins minerals for dinner it can consist of 1 cup of green salad 1 tbsp oil and vinegar dressing and 1/2 ounce of almonds or walnuts or whatever nuts you have available and 3 ounces of chicken breast a half cup of sweet potato 1/2 cup of green beans for your vegetable servings 2 whole wheat dinner rolls 2 tablespoons margarine and one cup of mineral water can go along with dinner and for a snack it can be 1 cup of low-fat fruit yogurt and 3 sliced dried apricots you can play with this does not have to include 3 meals on a snack just make sure that you're meeting recommendations so throughout the day and eating regularly these snacks set of slides focuses on food and fluid intake prior to exercise the overall goals of fluid can be providing energy for exercise particularly carbohydrate may help to delay fatigue that's associated with prolonged exercise fluid will serve to prevent hypo hydration and excessive dehydration can serve to minimize gastrointestinal distress and may satisfy hunger in some cases see if you can match the terminology on the left with the definitions on the right carbohydrate content and the pre exercise meal depends on gut tolerance and this can also be estimated at a rate of one gram of carbohydrate for every kilogram of body weight one hour prior to exercise 2 grams carbohydrate for every kilogram body weight 2 hours prior to exercise and 3 grams of carbohydrate for every kilogram body weight 3 hours prior to exercising be fluid corresponds to see usually within one hour of training due to fluid tolerance see that corresponds to G small amount and pre-exercise meal including a small amount of fat in a pre exercise meal will slow gastric emptying rate protein the corresponds with moderate amounts and pre in the pre exercise meal II know pre exercise meal and peer-reviewed research has been shown to decrease performance and finally F pre-exercise meal usually occurs within 1 to 4 hours before exercise and total volume of food must be considered athletes may find it beneficial to commit to trial and error when individually individualizing their recommendations the recommendation for carbohydrate and fluid before exercise are given here hydrate intake can range from 1 to 4 grams of carbohydrate that's needed for every kilogram of body weight 1/4 hours prior to exercise clear recommendations should be based on individual preferences and tolerances but if you want a general recommendation for fluid in an athlete that is adequately hydrated 5 to 10 milliliters of a fluid for every kilogram body weight in the 2 to 4 hours prior to exercise it's a recommendation if the athlete is hypo hydrated an additional 3 5 milliliters of water for every kilogram body weight 2 hours prior to exercise is recommended sodium added or a small amount of carbohydrate that's with some supposed strength may help to drive drinking or car you want to drink more and sodium can help your body hold on to water propel you may have seen this in the store makes packets that you can take on the run they contain electrolytes like sodium and potassium essentially it's Gatorade you the volume of food and fluids can be adjusted based on the amount of time before exercise begins trial and error is recommended during training here is a sample pre-competition meal for a 110-pound athlete 110 pound athlete weighs 50 kilograms and it includes 1/3 ounce of bagel approximately 3 1/2 inch bagel can be a whole wheat bagel 2 teaspoons of light cream cheese 12 ounces of orange juice and 8 ounces of a carbohydrate-containing beverage the above meal contains approximately 500 kilocalories 100 grams of carbohydrate 12 grams of protein and 5 grams of fat for a 50 kilogram 110 pound athlete carbohydrate content is 2 grams of carbohydrate for every kilogram of body weight ideally the bagel with the cream cheese and orange juice would be consumed 2 hours prior to the event and the sports beverage will be consumed slowly over the two hour period prior to competition oK we've had the opportunity to explore macronutrient energy expenditure during exercise this is figure 10.6 from you textbook and it shows the use and source of fuel during a marathon or ultra endurance sport you see on the x-axis exercise and time in hours and on the percent of energy expenditure at the beginning of the race muscle a large proportion of muscle glycogen is used that is depleted over the course of four hours the amount of blood glucose that is used for energy also increases so your blood sugar will drop it's important to replace carbohydrates during this exercising period plasma free fratty assets will be increasingly used for energy more so toward the end exercise and muscle triglycerides are used more so at the beginning of this race than at the end so the overall goals in food and fluid intake and timing include providing energy particularly carbohydrate this can help to delay fatigue also we want to prevent or delay Heiple hydration and excessive dehydration we want to prevent overconsumption of water when you over consume water you put yourself at risk for low blood sodium levels so it's important to replenish electrolytes and keep track of your weight before and after exercise it is important to replace sodium especially if losses are large or rapid if you're sweating profusely and a hot humid environment it's a very easy to lose a large amount of water and sodium in a short period of time and also you wanna minimize gastrointestinal distress only every marathon runner has a story about hitting the wall when the resources are depleted your glycogen is depleted and your body can no longer function at the level you want it to this is call hitting the wall you for people who exercise over an hour to hour hour and a half at moderate to high intensities it is recommended that they replace carbohydrate during that exercise we do have a limited ability to store carbohydrate as glycogen in our body we store up to approximately 1,800 kilocalories as glycogen as we saw in the previous slide glycogen can be depleted over the course of an endurance event by consuming carbohydrate doing exercise you can prevent low blood glucose concentration we see in the previous slide how much glucose can be taken from the blood the liver trust oblique break down its glycogen to compensate for the drop in blood sugar however gluconeogenesis is limited because gluconeogenesis itself requires energy so carbohydrate and the form of fluid or a gel in some cases can be beneficial for endurance and for endurance athletes or what occult stop-and-go athletes exercising and circuit training over a long period of time athletes in sports like basketball consume both water and carbohydrates usually in sports beverages when they are on the sidelines the ACSM the American College of Sports Medicine the A and D which the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the dietitians of Canada abbreviated DC recommend a customized plan for fluid intake per athlete it's based off of tolerance to precaution Ares or precautions should a fleece follow to prevent hyponatremia an athlete can avoid excess fluid intake and make sure to replace lost sodium over hydration can lead to hyponatremia the gastric emptying rate is slowed during high-intensity exercise or if the concentration of carbohydrates consumed is too great carbohydrate intake ranges be anywhere from 30 to 90 grams of carbohydrate per hour for sustained high intensity sports it is recommended that athletes include small amounts of carbohydrate as tolerated that can be gotten from mouth rinsing to the ingestion of large amounts up to 60 grams of carbs per hour that can be in the form of sports gel or sports drink for ultra endurance sports carbohydrate needs during exercise may go up to 90 grams of carbohydrate per hour this is Kimmy established through trial and error in order to make sure that your gastrointestinal tract can tolerate it consuming carbohydrate during prolonged exercise will help to preserve muscle glycogen stores and liver glycogen stores this information is also summarized in Figure 10.8 team in this chapter it highlights a gallons for fluid and sodium trial-and-error is strongly encouraged throughout this textbook in order to determine how well your body will tolerate whatever intervention you are putting it in place as far as fluid is concerned during exercise you may have a limited ability to drink fluid during exercise your body has a limited a bit of ability to absorb fluids from the gastrointestinal tract while you're exercising so it's important to go into an activity hydrate it a fluent plan during exercise is customized in order to meant excessive dehydration and in order to prevent excessive changes in electrolyte balance based on sweat break sweat composition or which electrolytes you're losing the most of the duration of exercise the type of clothing you wear while you're doing the exercise and the environmental conditions we all learn plate factor in fluid balance sodium is an electrolyte mineral someone who is said to be salty sweater can lose up to one gram of sodium per hour you the next set of slots focus on food and fluid intake after exercise you already know that is important to consume carbohydrate and protein ideally within 60 minutes of completing exercise this can help with recovery and help to replenish glycogen stores and you're going to build more muscle mass if you consume protein sooner rather than later so the goals of fluid intake after exercise should be to provide carbohydrate to resynthesize muscle glycogen to provide proteins to build and repair muscle athletes who get protein within an hour of exercise feel more muscle on average than athletes that wait longer it's important to rehydrate that's one goal of fluid intake after exercise and to re-establish your new hydration or your fluid homeostasis LeWitt's can serve to replace lost electrolytes after [Music] exercising like magnesium sodium potassium chloride for example and we also won't want to avoid gastrointestinal upset some people are sensitive to the amount fluid they can put in their body at one time they may feel bloated easily with fluid or may be sensitive to the temperature of fluids for example I've heard a number of people report to me that drinking really cold water particularly on empty stomach causes nausea and dyspepsia are some abdominal pain see if you can answer these questions or fill in the blank about food and fluid intake after exercise the timing of carbohydrate intake after exercise is critical can you explain why consuming this nutrient is critical within 2 hours of completing exercise well as explained in the text for this class a cellular glucose sensitivity and permeability are most optimal after exercise in fact the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis as high as immediately after exercise so that's why it's important to get carbohydrate in after 2 hours glycogen synthesis is substantially reduced by now you have been exposed to the glycemic index so one recommendation that you may want to try is to use the glycemic index as a guide for glycogen resynthesis it is recommended that you consume 1.5 grams of medium to high glycemic index foods in the first hour you of exercise in consume point seven-five to 1.5 grams of medium to high glycemic index foods over the next three hours here are some more opportunities to check your knowledge 15 to 25 grams of high quality what is recommended as soon as possible after exercise we know that is protein flow recommendations are 1.25 to 1.5 liters per kilogram of body weight loss beginning as soon after exercise as is practical to replace other electrolytes a variety of foods including fruits and vegetables are recommended fruits and vegetables can be an excellent source of potassium nuts can be an excellent source of magnesium protein should be no later than two hours post-exercise ideally within one hour for calculating how much carbohydrate is recommended within the first hour after exercise you can use the estimate 1.5 grams of carbohydrate for every kilogram of bodyweight try to include some medium to high glycemic index foods if you have a dependent demanding exercise session within eight hours consume as close to the maximum amounts recommended of carbohydrate as you possibly can protein after exercise is recommended that 15 to 25 grams be consumed within an hour but no later than two hours after exercise protein from a high quality source if your vegetarian or vegan and not allergic to soy sways an excellent source of amino acids it's a high quality protein egg whites are also a high quality protein a Greek yogurt and skim milk also ha proteins protein recommendations can increase to 30 to 40 grams within one to two hours after exercise for large body strength athletes after exercise 1.25 liters to one and a half liters of fluid is appropriate for every kilogram of body weight lost beginning as soon as you can after exercise if you lose a lot of sodium you need to replenish it have a salty snack you can get electrolytes from food fruits and vegetables even nuts the next objective focuses on different popular diets you may have heard of like the Paleo diet the newest diet crazes the keto diet or the ketosis diet neither of which I would recommend so let's take a look at the terminology the vegetarian refers to letters D and E the most common type of vegetarian ously lacto-ovo vegetarian lacto-ovo vegetarians include milk and eggs in their diet would exclude other animal derived products vegetarians need to be careful that they do not become deficient and develop an anemia common deficiencies include b12 iron calcium and zinc vegan refers to individuals who consume no animal throughout products and they tend to have or be at risk for certain vitamin or mineral deficiencies that include b12 iron calcium and sink the Paleo diet involves a diet in which grains dairy beans legumes potatoes sugar and processed foods are excluded paleo diets not necessarily balanced go with evidence-based research and things that you can get from your textbook Paleo diet also refers to letter elf typically the Paleo day meets about 50% of recommended calcium so these fad diets can be leading you down a rabbit hole and you may end up deficient in a number of vitamins minerals and it can impact your brain and physical function gluten-free refers to a diet that is appropriate for people with condition called celiac disease people with celiac disease have an abnormal response to the ingestion of gluten personal celiacs disease will suffer destruction of the lining of the small intestine as a result of gluten ingestion gluten is found in wheat barley and rye people with celiac disease must stay away from all these sources of gluten low carb refers to a diet plan the finest 3 grams of carbohydrates for every kilogram of body weight per day ok and it's not recommended for athletes the risk and benefits of caffeine and alcohol consumption are summarized in objective ten point four in your text see if you can correctly answer these questions number one caffeine is illegally and socially acceptable the answer is drug number two methyl xanthine is the primary active ingredient in caffeine and moderate doses it is considered safe number three improved performance may result from heightened awareness and they decrease perception of effort number four the content of caffeine and a product must be labeled this is false in my humble opinion I believe caffeine content should be required especially with the effects that caffeine consumption can have on a developing fetus if a pregnant woman in just excess and also people who have cart heart conditions who may be sensitive to the effects of caffeine your textbook lists classifications for caffeine intake that are considered low moderate and high low intake is considered amounts less than 200 milligrams per day moderate intake is the finest intake between 200 and 400 milligrams per day while high caffeine intake does an intake above 400 milligrams per day also be careful around your sleep schedule you want to stop drinking caffeine six to eight hours before you plan to retire for the night you have this table in your book that lists the caffeine content of selected foods and beverages I'm going to point out a few of them a venti commercially be rude coffee like you might get from a Starbucks chain can have 475 milligrams of caffeine and that single serving so drinking that entire beverage will put you into the high intake category and that's when you start to have increases in side effects such as jitteriness and in very high amounts caffeine can act as a diuretic different coffee beans have different caffeine concentrations we can get a lot of caffeine from energy drinks the range here is giving us 142 357 there used to be a drink available on the market that contained 500 milligrams of caffeine per one serving caffeine can be addictive it acts on the reward center in our brain side effects of caffeine can include having an increased blood pressure when at rest and increased blood pressure during exercise your heart weight may increase due to caffeine caffeine can be a gastrointestinal irritant can stimulate your gastrointestinal tract if you struggle with irritable bowel syndrome it may not help your situation and drinking too much caffeine too late the day is associated with decreased ability to sleep so if you answer these questions about caffeine studies show caffeine can increase blood pressure and in effect increases mortality that's false the temporary increase in blood pressure that you may get from exercise or consuming caffeine does not necessarily put you it early risk for mortality but having sustained high blood pressure over a period of time does increase risk of atherosclerosis and does increase risk of heart attack and stroke number two studies show caffeine may benefit people with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease that's true number three consumption of over blank milligrams per day is associated with insomnia anxiety Europe irritability headaches in GI upset consumption of over 500 milligrams of caffeine a day is associated with insomnia anxiety irritability headaches GI upset and this is a guideline that is for adults number four a moderate caffeine intake does or does not affect an athlete's hydration or electrolyte status the answer is does not a moderate caffeine intake will not affect hydration or electrolytes Etta's or essentially with moderate intakes we don't have to worry about caffeine diuretic effect caffeine can be an effective Peugeot genic aid in moderate amounts at appropriately timed intervals athletes may want to do trial and error with caffeine with a starting dose of about 2 to 3 milligrams of caffeine for every kilogram of bodyweight caffeine is a stimulant it acts on the central nervous system if you consume too much it's going to have you it may stimulate your gut and make you uncomfortable caffeine by itself does not result in fat or weight loss it can has the effect of ephedrine which is off the market there are recommendations for alcohol intake for adults based on gender drink equivalents are the same amounts of alcohol when it comes to how quickly it can be metabolized 1/2 ounce of 100% ethanol is equivalent to 5 ounces of wine which is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer that equates to eight to nine ounces of malt liquor you may have seen 10 ounces in previous editions of textbooks or of hard liquor alcohol contribute scatter calories to the diet seven kilocalories per gram also alcohol can block the action of antidiuretic hormone causing you to pee more and can increase your risk for - or dehydration over the past couple years there has been more peer-reviewed research that has linked alcohol to certain types of cancer however there is no research in older adult populations that has showed Meyer alcohol intake to be beneficial see if you can answer these questions ok let's go over them number one low to moderate doses of alcohol do not improve performance number two hot dosas of alcohol have a negative effect on fluid balance by blocking the action of ADH ADH is anti diuretic hormone and it is also known as vasopressin number three if sufficient carbohydrate is present alcohol does not impair glycogen resynthesis post exercises but if sufficient carbohydrate is not present alcohol does impair glycogen set resynthesis post exercise number for alcohol affects several hormones including melatonin which is a hormone that plays a role in sleep serotonin which plays a role in aggression level as well as overall mood it can affect your adrenaline and increase your heart rate and block the action of vasopressin also known as ADH this will increase your an output increasing your risk for dehydration and a hangover moderate alcohol consumption number five we're looking at may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease this is because it may increase high density lipoproteins a low dose of alcohol and in males is considered to be 0.5 grams of alcohol for every kilogram body weight binge drinking is never recommended it has negative physical social and psychological effects you can even injure your liver or large amounts of alcohol at one time and you can kill some of your brain cells the energy content of various alcoholic beverages are listed here some liquors can contain a hundred and ninety kilocalories in a one and a half ounce serving so be mindful of the calories that you are consuming in your alcohol mixed drinks can have two to six hundred calories if you I'm not sure if Copeland's cheesecake Bistro still serves this ridiculously large drink with about one liter of alcohol it is ridiculous okay dietary supplements and herbal genic aids are discussed as part of the fifth objective of this chapter and organic aid you know is a substance or strategy that can help improve athletic performance number two there have been few supplements that have been shown to be safe and effective try to get your nutrients from food there is only one nutrient that is more bioavailable in its synthetic form than in its food form and that is folic acid folic acid can be prescribed to individuals who have certain conditions like sickle cell anemia for example or for people who have cervical dysplasia number three supplements are loosely regulated and number four the National Collegiate Athletic Association on NCAA warrants against using supplements creates was discussed in a previous chaplet chapter is a notable exception and has been studied extensively and giving advice your practitioner Europe Dietetic practitioner should give as much unbiased scientific information as possible and also note that people will sell supplements are not a source of unbiased and from information because you want they want you to buy their stuff so it's best to go you know if you have access as an undergraduate to your library can be valuable resource for peer-reviewed literature also scholar.google.com and PubMed gov are also databases you can access to find supported scientific information practitioner should guide but don't decide at the end of the day the athlete needs to come up with his or her own decision you you vitamin and mineral supplements are widely used by athletes there have been studies that have reported some benefit in some cases for example if a vegan is not getting enough vitamin b12 a vitamin b12 supplement will be beneficial when dietary intake is terrible supplementing with vitamins and minerals is not going to be helpful in looking for a supplement make sure you check the supplement fact label check the percent daily value and try not to exceed the percent daily value be reminded that many vitamins and minerals have a ul or tolerable upper intake level and if you go over the UL you are increasing your risk for adverse effects protein supplements tend to be more expensive than supplements from food for example if eggs and egg whites tend to be cheap Greek yogurt you can get get for low cost as well protein supplements however tend to be convenient for some people probiotic supplements appear safe they play a role in our immunity and make up our gut microbiota sources of probiotics can include kefir which is a type of fermented dairy beverage yogurt and there's even frozen yogurt that contains probiotics you some athletes consider herbal or botanicals in an effort to prevent or recover from an illness or energy you have to be careful with herbals and botanicals they're not necessarily well regulated in some of them can increase risk of liver failure they tend to be more drug like than food like you need to I would advise you to speak with a healthcare professional if you're considering taking an herbal or botanical supplement and do some research on your own there are some supplements that may be more closely related to food like garlic soy and certain phytochemicals one example would be alpha lipoic acid roaring requires hours of training on a near-daily base you can optimize your performance by creating a periodic table for exercise and nutrition you in summary athletes need a comprehensive nutrition plan that is individualized to match the demands of training and competition eating nutrient-dense foods is the key to consuming an adequate amount of nutrients particularly vitamins and minerals diet planning must be highly individualized athletes must develop specific specific strategies for appropriate food and fluid intake before during and after exercise for those who choose to consume caffeine or alcohol moderate intake is recommended dietary supplements should be judged on the basis of ethics legality safety and effectiveness I recommend that you attempt the questions that are at the end of the chapter and do not forget to complete your weekly activity", "qTLxvp5yIqI": "[Music] [Music] hey everyone how's it going welcome to chef big cuisine so today we're going to making some red velvet chocolate chip cookies now if you're a fan of red velvet like I am you're gonna love these they're really easy to make they melted your mouth and they're good for all year round so let's get started okay so for the ingredients you'll need one-and-a-half cups plus one tablespoon of all-purpose flour 1/4 cup of unsweetened natural cocoa powder one teaspoon of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter 3/4 cup of packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup of granulated white sugar and you'll need 1 large egg at room temperature 1 tbsp of butter milk 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and then 1 tablespoon of red food coloring a liquid or gel and finally 1 cup of milk chocolate chips [Music] okay first you're gonna whisk the flour cocoa powder baking soda and salt together until they're well combined in a large sized bowl I'm going to set that aside now using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment you're gonna beat the butter on high speed until it's creamy and smooth for about one to two minutes you can scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl as needed throughout this process with the rubber spatula next you're going to beat in the brown sugar and the white sugar until it's well combined and creamy for about one more minute [Music] finally beat in the egg butter milk and vanilla extract and scrape down the sides of the bowl and the bottom of the bowl as needed with your rubber spatula to make sure everything is well combined [Music] [Music] you're looking for this type of consistency in your wet batter in the next section switch to a hook attachment on your stand mixer and pour the dry ingredients a third portion at a time into the wet ingredients while the mixer is running on low ensuring that the previous dry portion is well incorporated into the wet mixture before adding the next one [Music] [Music] a soft dough will be formed after the last portion of the dry is added once it's mixed add the food coloring and beat the dough until it's well combined and the color changes to red you can whisk in a teaspoon or two more teaspoons of food coloring if you would like the dough to be a brighter red [Music] on low speed with the hook attachment fold in the chocolate chips the dough will be slightly sticky cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap and chill it for at least one hour chilling the dough and the refrigerator is mandatory it has to chill for at least an hour before baking otherwise it'll spread too thin when you bake now pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit you can line one or two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats and set those aside now scoop about one and a half tablespoons of dough and roll it into a ball place about 10 to 12 of these dough balls onto each baking sheet bake each batch for 11 to 12 minutes the cookies will only slightly spread as they bake once removed from the oven press down on the warm cookies to slightly flatten them and form the cracks and creases stick a few additional chocolate chips into the tops of these cookies for a better look finally allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely and there you have it you just made red velvet chocolate chip cookies these are so delicious really easy to make and they satisfy any chocolate cravings you have and now the moment of truth let's see how these look I can't wait for you guys to try this at home if you like this content drop me a like and if

like how they taste at red lobster except a little better for you so let's get right into it guys [Music] okay guys here we go let's go ahead and get started uh again this is going to be a pretty straightforward recipe not too many ingredients so let's start off with a medium-sized bowl and two cups of almond flour here all right and then we've got looks like we've got a quarter teaspoon of baking powder that's going a quarter teaspoon quarter teaspoon of salt looks like that's good about there and about one full teaspoon of garlic powder all right and let's just whisk this bad boy up just to mix it up set this aside [Music] the big bowl all right large mixing bowl four cracked eggs we got four eggs and let's go ahead and toss in one cup of shredded cheese [Music] and the kick and folks melted butter let's get it and that's about a quarter cup so let's whisk this bad boy together fully combined all right so the next part of this is to combine the dry all right so just mix that until cool all right now let's put a little bit grease into this all right i think we are ready to rock and roll guys what do you guys think oh yeah cheddar bait all right guys so as i mentioned looks like cookie dough right in fact we're gonna use a cookie dough scooper uh to pop these guys on a cooking sheet lined with parchment paper and we are gonna do the cookie routine [Music] biscuits lined up uh and uh i've been preheated at 400 degrees and we're gonna get this going pop it in there and um should be good for about 15 minutes all right all right stay tuned y'all all right guys i don't know about you but i'm excited let's get it [Music] yes sir oh yeah just hear that sizzle oh it's amazing oh yeah this is uh i'm sorry i'm just so excited first time's a charm i guess huh look at that 15 minutes does justice all right so before we let it sit i've got this little mixture here of melted butter [Music] and some parsley here we are going to pass out these bad boys all right so let's let these sit for a few minutes before i dig into these guys all right guys so we are all set we are about to get right into the first bite all right guys so check it out it is a little a little toasty in here um but i am ready to give it a go these cheddar bay biscuits came out looking amazing i'm ready to dig right in so let's have you take a gander as well boom enter b-roll all right so some macro nutritional content for you some education right what is youtube without the education side of it i guess it could be a lot more but anyways um this recipe yields about about 25 biscuits altogether so if we if you get about 25 biscuits then the macro content is as follows um 97 total calories per biscuit 8 grams of fat per biscuit 4 grams of protein per biscuit and the most beautiful thing of all only 1.5 grams of carbs that is amazing right so the nutritional content is so give it a go if you like this video again like the video subscribe hit the red subscribe button and tap on that notification bell and again i appreciate all your guys's input leave some comments down below if you'd like to see my take on another low carb keto friendly treat whatever maybe throw it down there i'll give it a go but low carb keto style all right guys until next time peace out y'all", "jyfF2aGHbxo": "phase so if does that might mist just make sure you trying it your questions and before we log off but my contact details are going to be on all the slides in the folder anyway so if there's something you wanted to ask but didn't get get in touch so a little bit about myself through the background before we get going my factor is degree in food science and health which I did in Limerick went on and study Dietetics so I am a dietitian I'm at the moment I'm in the middle of a master's degree in sports and exercise nutrition so education and professional development are very very important for even for sports nutrition because anything I suggest you know it has a direct impact on your dietary preferences and choices which then in turn affect your health so really really important to have a good grasp of the mechanisms feeling everything I'm saying so on top of that then I actually was an international race Walker so I have a bit of an insight into what it's like to be an athlete and it's why I like to work predominantly with endurance athletes and at the moment I'm working with a couple of guys who either are Olympic athletes are they're on the way to Tokyo and then there's athletes from all various sports a professional cyclists International Marathon runners professional roars triathletes you name it I've probably worked with someone in the sport so enough about me I'm going to get into the talk and basically what's on the agenda today is how can we keep good habits during a climate change so obviously we Cove it now I suppose the whole dynamic of our day has changed so how can we make sure we're nice and consistent during this timeframe then there's going to be a couple of considerations to take into account for eating around exercise we're gonna look at fueling before during and after exercise and a little bit about hydration and then we're gonna jump into the Q&A at the end so that's kind of the skeleton outline of what we want to do if you have questions outside it is again put them to the end and I will try and get to them okay so during corvid like for most people this totally unprecedented time and we with something like that you know there's no there's no rules per se like no one really knows how to act and as a as a result you know people aren't really been held to any kind of standard like it's perfectly acceptable at the moment to stay in your pajamas through a three o'clock in the day like it's very low birth and when things like that happen sometimes we allow our own standards to drop you know and this is particularly relevant for athletes when you're not in a competitive environment anymore there's no races on the line it can be a little bit easy to lose your motivation and you're not really comparing yourself to other people unless you're Linda's travel that is so keeping up good habits and timing this is very very important why is nutrition at like on the day or on a decision the decision basis doesn't feel like it's making the biggest difference in the world because it's not as say impactful or tangible as going for a run you know you don't suddenly feel tired or you don't see like new muscles appearing when you make a good dietary choice it's all very underwhelming it can be easy to forget about it on a day to day basis so a couple of tips for keeping on top of what you need to be doing you're on kovat number one you need a new approach if you're someone who needs routine and routine can be a little bit of a trigger for you to do things like I know busy college athletes and Leaving Cert students they just do everything like clockwork because they have to but you know my grandmother used to say to me you will you take amount of time you have to do something so if you suddenly have all the spare time in the day you probably find you're not eating so so routine you're regimented and so the first thing that I have got a couple of people to do set an alarm are just at the start of the day write out a little bit of a routine or schedule it can be as loose as I need to have dinner around this time breakfast around this time and I'll do something to fill up the space in between if you have some kind of structure on your day at least you're not just playing drifting off into vagueness so that's that's step one I know it seems kind of it seems silly almost spotted it's really important that you keep a routine going writing it down is the best way to do is step two then go for low-hanging fruits if you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed by all of the things you could do with your nutrition because let's face it there are hundreds of things you could be doing you could eat your veggie and products you can try taking protein powder you could take a supplement and go for a little hanging fruits excused upon just do really easy things if you're trying to make a stacked don't go straight for like complex sports nutrition or set the period as a carbohydrate intake just add an extra two or three portions of edge to your day symbolize maybe start to control your carbohydrate portions maybe swap go to bar chocolate for peace fruit simple stuff just actually doing it makes a big difference and then on from that when you start doing say the simple things or like the really basics what I like to get people to do is for example I will never tell someone don't have this so I never kind of have negative negative reinforcement basically what and what we would do in turn is say you make a good decision you have like a banana as a snack instead of a mars bar or a couple of biscuits thing to do there is acknowledge okay I've made a good decision here this is good for me it's good for my goals in part for being control on my head and this is benefiting me and I did it on purpose good for me that's that's kind of the way I like to get people to meditate on us so in a sense what we're doing is making positive feedback loops around ice ball was beneficial to behavior as opposed to try and avoid the elephant in the room I hope I hope that makes sense I can't actually see people's reactions but I hope I've explained that okay so basically acknowledge when you're doing with something positive congratulate yourself first don't try and avoid chocolates don't have that your conscious effort for the day it's not I must avoid XYZ challenges how much good food can i eat or how many good decisions I can make on a day-to-day basis that's a really sort of a powerful driver for you making good decisions because you're making a game out of it final point there think of this is extra time nutrition is often something that's just it's just an afterthought for a lot of people which is a shame because correctly implemented nutrition say over the span of the season for an athlete it can make all the difference in the world if if you're not recovering properly if you're not hydrating properly if you're looking to gain a little bit of muscle mass or make sure your nutrient requirements are met all those things they add and they flow and your needs shift throughout the phases of the season and if you're not on top of us you're just losing out on games you didn't really know you could get so everyone now has like a little bit of extra time where you know there's the stakes are low it's you know you thought you're gonna have a race season this summer but focus on your weaknesses and in my few years of working with people nutrition is a Unilever weakness among the Atlantic populations what do they like to admit it or not it just is so use this time to stand there in the basics get your protein taking me on your hydration if you're an endurance athlete maybe start implementing some fat fuelled workouts and definitely the tough stuff you need to have your carbs for that and make sure your micronutrients are made if you do that you're well on the way these things are all explained in the slides by the way so just they're coming up so considerations for fueling for exercise so basically what this slide is about is let's say hypothetically I'm going to a training session in three hours time and when I'm done this presentation I want to have a meal what are the thoughts that should go into my head before I decide what to eat I should think about what kind of exercise it is is it a tough workout is it a really easy work and if it's a tough workout I might want to avoid some fiber rich foods and fat-rich foods because my intestines will be under a little bit of pressure to digest them and I might feel ill if it's an easy workout I maybe don't need to have such a humongous carbohydrate portion before I go what are your goals if your goals are to what I say this extract the maximum metabolic adaptations from a session if it's an easy workout like low vo2 efforts things like that you might have to go fat field that has some benefits over therapy would work for stimulating something called mitochondrial biogenesis so basically if you do it often enough carefully and I'll explain that later you kind of attack on points your vo2 max but it's not something you would do for a tough workout so if your goals are to be the most efficient endurance athlete you might look to start implementing things like that but if you're a thrower sprinter 400-meter runner probably not super relevant for that what's your fav training are you in say preparation like winter training or is it races and the answer is it's race season you should look to make sure your protein needs are missed that you might want to include some organic aids like caffeine's or sodium bicarbonate or it reduces things like that things that you just kind of want to familiarize yourself with for race day but not necessarily want to rely on for your sessions all year round that's I think I have this later on in the slow days as well but if you have questions on that just ask so basically to recap on this slide think about the training you're doing what the purpose of that session is and what what does how that might influence your food choices it usually boils down to fact fuel meal care filled me low fiber low fat meal that's that's kind of it I hope that makes sense so I on again I just have it here you might offer a fat fuel session if it's low intensity it's under 60 minutes you don't have a top session next day or it's not say idea when you're doing double training sessions fat fueled work really depletes your glycogen levels and that's a problem because that would suppress your immune system in return and hamper your recovery and say your ability to tolerate and execute a tough session within 24 hours doing that so if you're someone who trains every day you wouldn't do a fact viewing session the day before or the day after your toughest workout of the week so there's there's a couple of caveats you have to kind of stick on to the fatty one session fat oxidation typically Peaks around 70 65 70 % your max heart rate so if you're even doing like moderate aerobic efforts probably not appropriate to do with fat filled so there's a kind of there's really small parameters where that's appropriate and where it's not and so just think about that you might offer a carob fuel session if to Jim it's a gym workout and you're doing explosive stuff it's a circuit class you have a tempo session or say intervals or it's it's a race definitely one carobs for that reason being the higher the intensity think of this as a ladder to hurry go up the intensity ladder the more you rely on save glycolytic sources so carob carbohydrates essentially and you're not able to metabolize fast quick or efficiently enough to match a holly energy output so if you have a top session and you kind of want to nail it and do as well as you possibly could you should probably go for carbohydrates so that's that's really really important and it's more important in say competition phase a training not to be doing the fad huge workouts again because if you're on a fat fueled workout it suppresses your glycogen it wouldn't be a good thing to do and say a race week you do not want to suppress reflection that was in race week the other benefit for a carob peel session is you take on some high GI carbs so high GI basically is you absorb them very very rapidly what that will do is it will slightly raise your insulin levels and it will stimulate most protein synthesis so what that means basically it's kind of like muscle insurance if you want to think of it like that so if you're stimulating most protein synthesis it's not physically possible for you to break down or lose any muscle so say if you're a power athlete or a sprinter and you're looking to pack on lean mass it doesn't make sense to do fasted or fat fueled workouts and if you're looking to maximize your recovery and also doesn't make sense to do that so the last part of this poly is organic aids so if you don't know what an earth genic aid is it's basically a fancy word for sports supplements so the main ones would be creatine monohydrate caffeine beta alanine sodium bicarbonate and be reduced so is it a big fight before training you might look to have a caffeine or coffee reason being is if you take in some caffeine and I have the dosages in the timing a little bit later on what I can do is it can make your perception of fatigue a little bit dampened so you're not going to feel the fatigue as much as you might and it can also make it easier for you to coordinate kind of complex neurological movements so why why is this relevant when you get to say in racewalking I know for example most of the cards were handed out around 70% of the race so if it's a 20k between kilometers 14 and 15 that's where a lot of the cards and disqualifications happen the screws start to come loose you're a little bit tired they're not going to be so diligent with your technique the same could be said to say the concentration required for maximal sprinting for jumping for throwing hurdling anything that's kind of difficult to coordinate you would do well to include some caffeine beforehand you wouldn't want to do it for every session though because you can build up a bit of a tolerance to it so how I would say pick and choose when I have caffeine it would be before the key session of the week once or twice a week and that would be it before your session that's how you get the maximum benefit out of this if you're relatively new to running or you're not like say a highly trained at least you might look try be reduce if you want to squeeze some extra benefit from your endurance session so those beated shots are the most common way of getting it that can improve your vo2 Max anaerobic efficiency a little bit if you take it about two hours before training but bear in mind this doesn't really work if you're a well-trained athlete so the the more of a training and agent training background you have the less efficient be fruit juice will be but if you're getting ready for like your first marathon or like you want to need a local time gain it's your first time doing it trying beetroot juice in two or three long runs before race day will be a good way to trace just to see if you're able to tolerate it because it's it's not the nicest and it can it can play up on your stomach a little bit the last ones I mentioned there are creatine timing doesn't really matter for that so you wouldn't be having it before training and then there's two lactic acid buffers Dave alanine and sodium bicarbonate this is only really relevant for sprinters and throwers so I'm not really going to go through it there because most people watching is our endurance athletes but if you have questions about and ask it in or get in touch with me and I will I will answer them for you so I hope I hope that all makes sense the point I want to get across is you shouldn't have wound standard Mir before training you shouldn't look at every session it's the same thing think about what's what's my goal on race day what kind of athlete am i what adaptation do I want to squeeze from this training session and that should inform your food choices so I hope this slide makes sense it's very very important so this to be honest I just kind of describes this this slide and what I'm gonna put some food choices around it now so if you're opting for a Caribbean before a training session personally what I would do I would have it around two to three hours before I go and I would keep it to say simpler carbs or at least not hold me in products and so I might go for the likes or the baked potato or to a large bowl of pasta white pasta or a large bowl of white rice if I'm in a rush I might have delays the white bagel with some Jam basically simple carbohydrates low in fiber and you might ask why am I going for little fiber foods the reason being when you start exercising even low intensity the blood is shunted away from your intestines and you release some hormones and your guts that reduce your motility and gastric emptying rate so if you have things like fibers or fats to take a long time to digest you might have some bloating stomach pain even diarrhea are vomiting and this is particularly true if you're doing intense work or altering your and stuff so meal before a training session it shouldn't really be a quote-unquote healthy eating guidelines you know if that's not really want to have all the vegetables and all the fiber say of that for everything after training that's usually what I recommend people to limit the likes runners tracks or being doubled over and stomach pain it used to happen me laugh I never understood why and you know I was I was subscribing to the food pyramid which is great for general population but for just four before during and after training the healthy and guidelines don't really apply so just keep that in mind secondly then if you're going for a fact-filled session you have two choices here if it's say first thing in the morning you can simply get up roll out of bed and do it that's a fact fuel session is you've been fasting on life and you're gonna have very low or no like lemons left so that's one option if you're a if you're an early-morning riser I am NOT because I have a very small baby who doesn't allow me to do things like that so I have to transcend the middle of day or in the evening time if I was going for a factual session say early afternoon I might make my breakfast something like an omelet or some scrambled egg with maybe one piece of tarts bacon and some avocado that's that's a pretty satiating low carb meal and it's not going to say jump in the way of the training adaptation you want from a fact-filled session so that's that's how I would do that then point three on this slide are joining a if I was going to have a coffee alright I was gonna have some caffeine what I want is half a milligram of caffeine per kilogram of body weight okay so I'm gonna explain what that means I'm AG kilos so for me to get a performance benefit I have to have 40 milligrams of caffeine so a standard cup of tea like like this that has 40 milligrams of caffeine in it so if you weigh less than 80 kilos a cup of tea will be enough to give you that performance benefit you want if you want something a little bit stronger cup of coffee has 80 milligrams so do the likes of Red Bulls and Monster energies they all have 80 milligrams of caffeine in them and will definitely be enough to give you that performance benefit if you are going for caffeine take it about 45 minutes before your session or race starts that's how long it takes for it to peak in your in your bloodstream so when I finish my cuppa tea for example it's 25 past 12 now it might be run for past 110 past 1 by the time it's kind of at its peak levels in my blood where it's most useful to me and caffeine has a half-life of about 6 hours so it will stay at the high level for 6 hours basically so that's that's really the main one you'd want to look at before training if you're gonna try to be to reduce you're looking to get a better job or 300 mils of beetroot juice 2 hours before training it takes 2 hours for - for the nitric oxide to peak in your blood so I trigger the long run say the weekend 2 hours before you start that's when you take it in if anyone has questions on that just I brought them to the clerics Ireland account they'll be relayed to me and I will answer them at the end ok so I'm gonna move on if your carob fueling and I had briefly touched on this but this is an important slide and 1 to 1.5 grams of carbohydrates per kg of body weight to three hours before training so for me if I'm looking at a meal that has 82 grams of carbohydrates in it I might go for a bowl of oats so maybe 50 60 grams of oats some low-fat milk and I might put some honey on top or maple syrup that'll hit me my 80 grams or I might have bagel with jam and a small glass of juice that's how I would do that and all of those things will fit in the hygiene category more or less if you're finding yourself that you get a little bit hungry are you have to leave your main meal four hours more or more before your training session you might look to get a little snack in 30 minutes before you start just to keep the peckish miss a day exercise will kind of dampen your appetite anyway as a result of a hormone called GABA it's released when you exercise so if you are hungry that will go away but you shouldn't ignore your hunger and if it has been maybe more than three hours four hours between your last meal and the training session having the lights of a banana or some dried apricots or dates 30 minutes before you get going is probably a good idea and you're looking maybe to get a 25 30 grams of carbohydrates so that basically would look like standard banana for over six to eight apricots and four or five dates those are all han gyeo as well they shouldn't really impact on your tummy or not there's not too much fiber in them it's just again simple sugars and again the carbohydrate protocol this is best for tough sessions and key sessions that you kind of want to nail so you can get the most out of them and set yourself up for kind of a good recovery platform so gonna move on from that if you're going to do a fat fuelling session as I said you want you want you only really want to do this if it's low intensity unless the 65 minutes and you can include very low GI carbs if you want a fat fuel breakfast for example so what I might have is one slice of say call me a did break and I put a little bit of butter on it that's very low GI so because I'm happen to may be the bread and an egg maybe some avocado that's going to really so slowly that any carbohydrates in it that get released into my blood it's not going to cause any insulin say level rises and it's not going to say effect my fat adaptive response or my muscle protein synthesis so think of it like this when you have fat filled workouts you have say the mitochondrial biogenesis response if it's a caribou workout you have an anabolic response they are antagonistic so if your insulin level rises you're not really being going to be able to do a fat filled workout basically so that's why low GI carbs specifically and a very small portion so I hope that makes sense and you'll be looking to have that meal two or three hours before you go and that's that's good for easy sessions or kind of your your longer sessions and that's that's how I would do that if you want to mix mix these approaches and again this is kind of summarizing what we would have talked about already but for my clients I get them to maybe do two or three fat filled workouts a week and weepy realize this so for their morning recovery sessions at her arrest days this is when they'll do this type of stuff we use carbs for conversations and a cheeky way you can get both benefits is doing something called delayed feeding so if you're a marathon runner a race walker an ultra endurance at least if you're like say gonna for a long session on a Sunday morning get off first thing in the morning maybe have an Americano with no sugar go and wait an hour before you start fueling so you might take a gel or a sports drink you get an hour into your session on fat-filled so you get that adaptive response you want and then you start feeding so you're not gonna totally say how much I'd like gin levels down and you're not totally say in impacting on the integrity of your session or how well it could go so delayed feeding is a good way to do that and a lot of say a lot of professional cyclists I'm working with they'll do stuff like that as well and they find very very useful it's just the way it's killing two birds with one stone and but again if you're like 5 or 10k runner odds are your sessions aren't with you long enough to do this so this is only really applicable for guys who have sessions that are 90 minutes at least or more ideally two hours plus so I hope that makes sense I'm going through that I'm not gonna zip through organic AIDS again but those are the numbers they're just um if you wanted to look at them this from what I understand will be put on YouTube so if you're looking for these numbers you'll be able to find this online anyway so during training this is this is an interesting interesting thing we can we can do to improve your performance a lot most people's jaws drop when I tell them that when they're exercising especially if it's sixty minutes or more that they probably need to be taking in 500 to 600 minutes of fluid per hour simply to just match your sweat rate and I'm going to talk about hydration later on but this is fearsome part especially if you're looking to perform optimally if it's a tough session or if it's hot like I'm looking over here no it's not too hard at the moment but we had hot weather the last few days and I know from my clients checking in who did and who didn't name the hydration base and how the training went I could tell so hydration is one aspect of us if you're doing anything over 75 minutes in duration you're probably gonna have to start fueling on the go so the best way to do it is you're using a two-to-one carb source so if you've ever looked at a gel or a sports drink and unless it says June carob source it's probably not the best so what I'd be looking for is two to one ratio of malt or dextran to fructose that's the most well tolerated like sports product you can get it causes the least amount of symptoms and crucially if you're an ADIZ athlete what it'll do is it'll enable you to absorb the physiological max and I'm going to run through those numbers in a minute so if you're using a gel you needed to say two to one carbohydrates are honest if using a sports drink you still want to powder has that two-to-one source and you want to make your drinks up to ace to 10% solution anything over that use that you risk feeling a little bit sick or vomiting there's there's one key team to avoid say got problems on on race day or marathon day if you're going to be implementing fueling guidelines it practice that's actually the biggest determined and how how when you tolerate something your intestinal physiology actually changes if you start feeding carbohydrates during training you actually get an increase in the expression of carbohydrate receptors so you get more of them you get better at it which is actually I think it's pretty cool but you know all you read studies for phones are mice my my idea of cool could be a little bit noticing with norm but it is interesting another interesting element here is if you're doing say a tough session and it's under sixty minutes in duration and say you want to try and force yourself to get that fat adaptative response simply having the likes of a lucozade sport or high five energy in a bottle and doing a mouth rinse and just spitting it out not actually swallowing it that actually has a beneficial impact on performance so what that basically shows is there is a psychological element at play in terms of say fatigue sensation and responses so if you have a session under sixty minutes long with the top session you can do your carob melt rinsing and you you still do a good session and you can still get that fat adaptation response so that's that's just a little little thing there to think about and you know for some people on Detroit it's a good way of marrying up those two adaptation pathways so then if we're looking at how many carbohydrates do you want to take in if you're just going easy and you're just trying to get used to it 30 grams an arrow would be the bare minimum I would say four guys are guards racing so that's that usually ok for an event that's under 90 minutes in duration mainly because normal glycogen levels they last for a hundred and forty minutes which is why he's saying in a marathon a lot of people will hit the wall as at around 100 minutes in and for some people that's when they get to maybe more than 13 14 15 depending on her faster running obviously but you only have a finite amount of glycogen so if your event is shorter you just kind of need less carbohydrates to reduce the likelihood of burning them basically so the longer your event is more you need to take in if you're a marathon runner you'd be looking at ideally getting 60 to 70 grams an hour and which basically looks like two gels are a gel and a handful of gummy bears or something like that they tend to be pretty well tolerated on the road for elite athletes knowing two grams an hour is kind of the that's the gold standard it's easy to do with like the looks of a race Walker they're gonna run two kilometer do they have access to bottles every eight to nine minutes religiously if you're a cyclist same thing if you're a marathon runner are you doing a half marathon you know odds are you're on like this loop that goes around this city and they're scenic routes and you might only have access to a bottle every three miles so for those guys it's kind of a tough thing to match up and so you'd be looking at maybe carrying a copper gel as a place and a few friends along the course and having them swath swab gels with you so that that's that's a hard one to manage logistically but you know people manage that 90 grams in our dough and the two-to-one carob source ratio way they're important in your intestines you have two different types carbohydrate receptors STM t1 and loot v so the likes of glucose two ripe sugars like maltodextrin you can absorb approximately sixty grams an hour of them from your intestines and then you're in your gym v receptors you can absorb about 30 grams of fructose so there's a two-to-one absorption ratio there that's why two-to-one on a sports product is very very important and if you're an athlete trying to say max out how many cards you get in the door you need to do two to one or you won't be able to hit that 90 grams an hour so that's that's why that's really important so maximum performance is your is your goal and you have maybe experience hitting the wall before this is probably something you would want to look at so post-training how can we make sure you nail your recovery this often surprises people actually where my focus will be with the guys I'm working with easiest thing to do within 20 minutes of finishing and maybe just have something in your gear bag you want half a gram of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight that's what the evidence suggests is the best thing so for me I'll be looking for a 40 gram dose of carbohydrates so I might have a banana and maybe the likes of a flat white because in injecting caffeine after training can help with this recovery process so why why does 20 minutes matter basically when you exercise you get an increase in say glucose transport and your insulin sensitivity increases so for all intents and purposes anything you eat essentially gets hoovered up by yourselves and it gets almost shuttled straight away to your glycogen stores so glycogen depletion is one of the measures of how recovered you are and it turns out that the more your glycogen is restored the better you are as completing say subsequent exercise bouts and tolerating the workload in a talk session so that's lots of words and the 20 minutes then came from they looked at people who timed their post-training recovery differently people who had these carbohydrates within 20 minutes the people who didn't if you were athlete athlete's a within 20 minutes and anti-b not and had the same amount of carbohydrates 24 hours later athlete hatless as glycogen levels are 66 percent higher than athlete B so they're much more ready to do the toff session there are much better recovered they have less immune suppression so that's really really important and that 20 minute really matters and that half carbohydrates per kg and body weight really really matters caffeine can help ameliorate that process and make it higher again so if you get it in within 20 minutes then you can chill you know you can shower you can you can get dressed you can do whatever and get to a meal when you can there's no real and there's no real major rush on you if you can get that initial burst in as soon as possible for your meal post training then you're looking at getting 1 to 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight of carbohydrates so again I'm an 80 kilo man and I'm not going to apart from my dinner after a training session so what does an 80 grams of carbohydrates me look like it could be one large big potato and if I was going for veggies then I might have some peas and they're very high in carbs I might have some broccoli and maybe some beans as well I would have a lean protein source so going for the statue carbohydrates and a baked potato that gets me my 80 grams that's my recovery kinda locked up and nailed right there one thing that often surprises people around post rain and recovery is that the protein doesn't really matter as much as you might think so the evidence has been pretty clear that for say moss and recovery which is not what I'm talking about here I'm talking about glycogen recovery that whole idea of the anabolic window has been widely disregarded in sports nutrition research and literature the most important thing understand what your needs are so for an endurance athlete it's around 1.2 to 1.4 grams per kg per day so for me I'm 96 to 110 grams a day at roughly candidates so what I would need to do is make sure I just get that in over the course of the day that's much more important than in relation to training when I eat my protein so before Kisan bigger picture you will fare better in general couple of points on nailing most protein synthesis as I know that was a question I got if he wanted to be optimal and I said like that because sometimes optimal isn't practical eating say a high biological value protein every three hours is the best way to do that so what is high biological value look like something dairy derived maybe a whey protein maybe it fulfilled our milk cheese yogurt you could look at eggs and any kind of fish or meat source those things all have 20 amino acids in them which is why I'm suggesting them if you're a plant based at least you would want to start getting say complimentary protein sources so you might look to have some legumes and maybe some grains or if you're having the links and pulses you might want to have grains with it as well just you get your 20 amino acids in in general plant proteins lack something called branch chain amino acids debate the main one being using so you seen I know I'm kind of gone on a bit of biochemistry tangent here but this is important and I wrap it all up into a practical thing you can do leucine is the amino acid that's most linked with most protein synthesis so for optimal levels of mostly protein synthesis our muscle growth you want to get two to two and a half grams of leucine every three hours you can do that very easily by having any of the sources that previously mentioned the dairy eggs meat fish sources or if you're a plant-based athlete what I sometimes get them to do is to have a little scoop of BCAAs branched chain amino acids with their meals that's literally the only time that that's appropriate so if you can eat close to every 3-4 hours get a protein source there don't worry about getting a protein shake and after your training it won't benefit you so just put that one to bed I'm sure there's gonna be questions about that it's often the way when something has just been an unquestioning belief for so long that anything contrary to that there's usually uproar what it's not my opinion it's what the literature said so carbohydrates sugar uranium after training so last topic then we're gonna look at those were actually at 45 minutes already hydration so why is hydration so important I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about why it's part first although I have the points and kind of worked out a little bit differently 1% dehydration so for me that's 0.8 of a kilogram last and sweat and to know what that feels like it's not very tangible or noticeable for example if you're thirsty you are 1% dehydrated 30 minutes ago if your urine is starting to get discolored or yellow you are at least 2 or 3 percent dehydrated and that response is a delayed response because your kidneys have to react to excrete less water if you're if you're dehydrated so your hypothalamus is in charge of regulating this and your body doesn't necessarily react or prompt you to take action for a while it's not like instantaneous so basically 1 2 or 3% dehydration you don't really feel any different if you're sitting down at rest in Whitefield harshly you might have dark urine why is it important 1% dehydration results in a 10% drop in aerobic performance for 3 days that's absolutely huge if you're on 2 or 3 percent then that that goes maybe to 20% 30% it's it's pretty exponential and pretty pretty devastating on sports performance those are all arbitrary numbers if you want practical number every percentage point to dehydration you have your core temperature rises by quarter of degree Celsius so bear in mind in clinical settings if your core temperature rises by about a degree your class is having a fever so if we then look at someone doing a 10k 20k walk half marathon marathon they're sweating it's hot they're getting hotter if your core temperature is rising in your dehydration the main thing that's happening is your blood flow is going to the surface of your skin to cool you down that's our mechanism for keeping cool hydration on the head with this well you have to keep recording which are down to and white accent barton days if your blood is going to the surface of your skin it's not in your muscles so it's being shown to the way from where the oxygen is required that's where you get your oxygen from so that 10% performance decrease it's basically you start getting lactic at 10% say below where you normally would and in terms of say 50k walk for example that could mean 25 minutes of the difference if you're a standard marathon runner you're three hours Plus that could be 15 20 minutes down the road that you've slowed down by not paying attention to this so how can we how can we monitor our hydration text and your encoder are poor ways to do it and that's what we typically do you can't really monitor it the best thing to do is pre-emptive like you can't see this here but I always have a bottle of water his sparkling water at my father in my hand and I just have it ingrained in my behavior that I drink something just a sip every 15 20 minutes because if you fail if you feel thirsty you're already dehydrated you've already taken away from your sports performance potential so definitely won't look out for particularly in summer months particularly for endurance athletes who are relying predominantly on aerobic capacity so the numbers then if you're looking to stay properly hydrated you're looking at Turkey five minutes per kilogram per day so for me a taquito dude it's approximately I'm doing the math I've taught me halyard it's approximately two point six two point seven meters a day plus five to six hundred meters per hour of exercise so I don't know what all you got his way but you know yourself multiply your weight by 35 that's how much you need our rest day and you're adding in five six hundred minutes per hour of exercise then if it's hot you might looked at a little bit extra so in training then ideally what you're looking for is a sports drink the reason being is that the presence of glucose or sugars and sodium they will help draw water into your into your system better than water alone and it's it's even shown would say a very low solution or three percent sports drink it will actually work to rehydrate you better and water itself so that's why sports drinks exist they provide superior hydration than water alone so that's that's really really important one thing you probably don't need to do is to start supplementing with electrolyte tablets or like those and iodine sachets most people don't need them unless you're training for like 4 hours plus per day usually you don't start losing the lace of magnesium and sodium the chlorides in your salt and your sweat until you're a few hours in the only one you're gonna lose in appreciable amounts would be sodium and if you have a Western diet you order to get twice the sodium that you're supposed to and if you're having a sports drink you're replacing your sodium anyway so what I get people to do is after a session particularly if it's half just sprinkle or crack some salt onto one or two meals a day again that's not a healthy eating guideline that's the opposite to what suggested but if you have a high exercise saying load it's probably a good idea to do something like that with hydration it's not just about say the concentration of your blood it's also about the concentration of electrolytes if they flux at all your serious ramifications to that so those are numbers stick to them as well as you can if you need help put anything you know I've gone through in the slides just my contacts are down there website Twitter handle Instagram handle and just get in touch with me not answering the questions I've no problem doing that that's that's everything for today if I had to two or three hours and that people are very long attention spans I would go much longer but if you have questions pop them to account there and if you relayed to me I have a few questions here then I'm going to go through for the next few minutes and so if I've answered your question some of them are a little bit repetitive but I'll go through them as I'm going down so first one that came in there where I recommend taking collagen protein for achilles tendonitis probably not ten noises information not necessarily actual structure and tissue damage so collagen and vitamin C supplementation 10 grams a day is recommended if you have connective tissue damage so and a tear or a fracture or something like that not necessarily for ten days for tendonitis I might recommend once the initial information is settle down that you make sure your intake of a media tree is around to 2.5 grams a day and enter gating say varied sources of antioxidants so what I would say is eat the rainbow and that sounds a little bit childish but the antioxidants and the media trees will help hamper any unwarranted inflammation that are just kind of causing him pain that might be getting in the way or frightening you from rehabbing properly but no to the collagen on that one so well it's a good fuel and refuel snack for children pretty much the guidelines back there if I this is for 11 12 to 13 year old kids if if I had stay when my daughter's 11 she's she's a little younger than that now when she's 11 and she's going exercising what I might do is get her to have a bowl of pasta or maybe a baked potato two hours before training leave her go training and when she's finished because she's a child I might give her a few harrybo jellies are some confectionery snakes as I said it's not healthy eating guidelines before during and after training it's simple sugars you know that's that's what's best for for recovery in fueling and so that's that's what I would avoid me I would make it like a useful time to have to give them a treat I very much add opinion that kind of a balanced moderate approach is better than say the hash tag clean eating I'm really not into that kind of stuff and I hope that answers the question be great to hear my views on a paleo and keto diets so I'm not really into any diet to be honest although it's really think I have to be politically correct here all diets they wrap up the same thing in a different marketing Trojan horse so most diets will do the following make you eat more vegetables probably make you cut out processed off probably making cut out alcohol and as a result you subconsciously pay more attention to your sleep activity levels and portion control some things like a paleo diet a ketogenic diet and vegan plant-based diets they're just quite out a lot of the crap just by virtue of the parameters that are set around them it's very hard to kind of have that traditional Western diet and those hyper palatable junk foods if you're subscribing to a dietary mechanism so I'm not really I'm not really for anyone diet at the moment I have four athletes ranging in I suppose ability and level of professional to international to recreational on high-fat diets not necessarily ketogenic there is a difference the ketogenic diet will be less than 20 grams of carbohydrate today a high-fat diet is where more than 70% of your energy is from fats I have a few guys on that at the moment because they're doing easy training and because their sporting goals would benefit from doing it just a very short period of a high-fat diet but it's never a year-round thing so yeah I'm not not a fan of the anything diets when I when I'm working with someone my my approach is well work what works for you you know healthy eating guidelines are there they're the basics we build off of and there's maybe 200 ways we could do any I need for any one person and it would still be bright so it's fair what works for the person not necessarily which day to camp to subscribe to one of the problems there is all of these diets would work and usually most people's and measure for a diet reset fricassee is weightless so all diets can lead to weight loss and you know if if person a believes guys X is the best in person why he believes the W is the best from their own like personal experience they're bought right because maybe they both trailers it was good for them this is one of the reasons you see lots of arguments on like social media and Facebook and why there's so much contradictory information a lot of people who write it missed the point - yes this is one way you're doing it it's not necessarily the best way so that's my view there they're useful if he works for the person on door I would shy away from ketogenic diet to be honest most people who do is there make poor", "q-RrVo0Jcm0": "[Music] new kind of

cookie banana oatmeal cookies i am using two different oats because i want to use them up quick cooking oats and roll oats but if all you have is one kind that's fine too if using raw oats only roughly grind one half cup of it in your food processor or coffee grinder just give it a few pulse [Music] double or triple the recipe if you are baking in the oven the full recipe is in the description box below along with oven baking instructions so make sure you check the oven baking section [Music] and there is nothing special about it just mix everything in a bowl and you're ready to bake now if you do want it a little bit sweeter i am adding chocolate chips so for vegans you can add maple syrup i did start with two medium bananas but my batter was just a bit too dry so i added an additional banana line your cuckoo with a parchment paper now you can make one big giant cookie by putting all the batter into your rice cooker or shake them into any size you want these cookies will not rise or expand during baking so shape them into the size that you like them to be and just press them down a little bit it does say five ingredients but i have two different types of oats which you don't need and the chocolate chip is optional so yeah still five ingredient right [Music] and let's do our first bake now do keep in mind that one bake cycle is 5 to 10 minutes in hot high heat and 20 to 25 minutes in warm heat depending on your rice cooker after two bake cycle which is one hour and these look beautiful they smell great as well carefully lift out the parchment paper and let them cool for about five to ten minutes i really appreciate you watching my video i hope it was enjoyable if you did enjoy it hit the thumbs up button and if you're new to my channel welcome don't miss any of my recipes by clicking on that subscribe button and notification bell i upload new videos every saturday here on life of pain and just look at these cookies they are beautiful smells wonderful and healthy too i love cranberries and these are just loaded with it now you can use cranberries or whatever dry fruit you like i love hearing from you so please comment below even just to say hi if you do make any of my recipe i would love to see them you can email me or upload them into my rice cooker facebook page or tag me in any of these social media sites at rice cooker baking and these are not crispy but has a chewy texture to it and having the quick oat or the grind roll oats really help to hold the cookie together oh yeah they are so good with a hint of sweetness definitely make these if you like oatmeal cookies enjoy them anytime and don't feel guilty about it this cookie is at a too sweet too sweetness level with a chocolate chip if you are new to baking in your rice cooker there are a few important reminders to keep in mind recipes with one cup to one and a half cup of flour is best for minimal baking time depending on your rice cooker it will probably stay on cook for about five minutes and then it's gonna go into the warm status and this is completely normal when baking there's not much liquid and so the rice cooker must go into this warm status to prevent it from overheating but you don't have to worry your baked good is still baking in this warm state since we do have to come back and push that cook button again set a timer for 30 minutes and when the timer goes off just press that cook button and then set another timer now if you press that cook button and it will not go in to cook but keep staying on warm that just means it needs more time to cool off so just let it sit for another 10 minutes and try again and you do have to repeat this bake process until your cake is done try not to open your rice cooker until after the second or third bake cycle because we do want to keep that warm air inside the rice cooker to continue to bake your cake and to test whether your cake is done or not just use a chopstick toothpick skewer or knife insert into the center and if it comes out clean without any wet batter then your cake is done thank you so much for watching my video i will really appreciate it if you give me the thumbs up down below if this video was helpful and enjoyable and if you have not subscribed to my channel yet why not click on that subscribe button and that notification bell that way you know when i upload new videos and i should hope that you will come back and watch more videos but until next time happy baking you", "MdraHcsfG44": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the growing trend in sports nutrition is that every athlete's body is unique at the gatorade sports science institute we are working to help athletes and their influences better understand these differences so they can better fuel their bodies gssi has a variety of tools to accomplish this from testing the unique attributes of each athlete to nutrition personalization programs and educational outreach gssi is striving to make sure athletes and their influencers are more informed about their nutritional needs than ever before [Music] gssi is also an educational resource for sports health professionals athletic trainers strength and conditioning coaches registered dietitians and sports scientists all turn to gssi to gain insights into the latest research and strategies that they can put to use with their own athletes whether it's in the lab or on the field online or offline gssi is giving athletes and their influences an invaluable look at how nutrition and hydration can change their game help them reach their goals and become the best they can be [Music] hi everyone and welcome to the fourth gssi field school and good afternoon or good morning wherever you're joining us from and thanks to everyone who is joining us today and if you've attended previous webinars then you probably know who i am by now but for any new attendees and i'm dr rebecca randall and i've been working with the gatorade sports science institute for eight years and i'm currently a senior scientist as with the previous sessions i'm going to be moderating and asking the speakers any questions so we'd love to hear from you and if you've got any questions please type them into the q a box and we'll try and get through as many questions as we can after each speaker has spoken and to give you some background about gssi our long-standing mission is to help athletes optimize their health and performance through research and education in hydration and nutrition science and we work primarily under four main pillars and these are education research innovation and athlete service these webinars are related to our education pillar with the aim to educate more sports science or sports professionals than ever and as we obviously cannot meet in person due to these challenging times this virtual platform is a great way for us to provide sports nutrition presentations today as you would have seen our talks will be focusing on nutrition and hydration for football and our speakers are dr julia bone and dr robert norton the format will be the same as previous webinars each speaker will have 20 minutes and as i said we should have some time after both speakers have presented for some questions and answers so let's begin with our first speaker who is dr julia bone julia is a registered dietitian an scnr practitioner and advanced sports dietitian julia completed her phd at the australian institute of sports before moving to northern ireland where she currently works as a performance nutritionist with sport northern ireland sports institute julia has worked with senior and developing athletes across a number of different sports and julia's going to talk to us today on nutrition for football so i'll pass it over to you julia thank you very much becca for the introduction and good morning or afternoon everyone um as well so this presentation is going to cover briefly the basics of football physiology and then subsequently the energy and macronutrient requirements and reported nutrition practice of football players and recommendations for match day nutrition so it's important to understand the physiological and metabolic demands of football as this will dictate the nutrition strategies and interventions to support performance for outfield players a typical match consists of periods of high intensity running and to mix with periods of low intensity running walking or rest energy production is predominantly aerobic however anaerobic energy production also plays an important role with decreases in muscle glycogen linked with increases in fatigue and decreases in performance thus making muscle glycogen the key substrate and carbohydrates a key nutrient for energy production during matches uh this is reflected true matches also just uh so this is reflected in the differences in training load on match days compared to training days um as can be seen here from the study by andersen's and colleagues with greater total distance max speed and sprint distance covered in matches compared to trainings and english premier league players so this study had a small sample size of six however similar results go on the next slide were also observed in about 36 to 39 senior men competing in the top dutch league with higher total distance and max speed in matches compared to trainings independent of playing position so in these studies energy expenditure was assessed by doubly labeled water so it doesn't provide a breakdown or comparison of the day-to-day expenditure but an average of either the seven or fourteen day study period uh total daily energy expenditure was reported to be around 3 300 or and 3 500 kilocal per day in both studies absolute energy expenditure doesn't appear to vary across positions but when reported relative to body mass or lean mass goalkeepers tend to have a lower expenditure due to their bigger size and north midfielders had the highest energy expenditure in adolescent academy players total energy expenditure has also been measured by either doubly labeled water or accelerometry across the different age groups um energy expenditure increases with age which is not surprising as players develop and mature resulting in bigger size and lean mass henna and colleagues reported average energy expenditures over two seven day periods with differences week to week in the under 12s and under 13s but not in the under 15s and under 18s g expenditure of the under 18s was found to be comparable to the senior players there's limited information regarding energy expenditure and fema for callers and values are often predicted and not measured by doubly labeled water or accelerometry uh looking at these figures it would appear that on average senior women expend less energy than their junior counterparts but as all these values have been estimated estimated using it's difficult to make comparisons between the different age groups but it would appear uh the energy expenditure ranges from around 2100 to 200 and female footballers as far as i'm aware there's been one study which was published just this year and professional female players that compared energy intake and energy expenditure across and in season week they didn't report total energy expenditure but their energy expenditure during exercise across the different training days as expected exercise energy expenditure varied with light training days and risk days being lower than the heavy training or match days what's interesting from the study is that we can see that the average self-reported energy intake does not vary across the different days even though exercise energy expenditure does in the study only one player was identified as being an under reporter so the results indicate that there was under fuelling in these female players and this is reflected in the low energy availability on the match and heavy training days for the other studies and female athletes energy is in intake is averaged across the study period so there's no differential between training or match days and the other study in senior woman was reported to be an average intake of around 19 100 kilocalories per day while in junior female elite players is a wide range of energy intakes with uh intex on average been around 2017 canadian junior athletes and 2260 in the german athletes um and this large variation in the junior players could be due to the variation in the ages from 13 to 17 and also potentially on reporting as well similar to the female athletes there's average daily intakes rather than comparisons to training and non-trained in days will match days in male academy players self-reported energy intakes and this group have been reported to be on average around 900 kilocalories per day across the three age groups in one study and approximately 2 600 and the under twelves under thirteens two thousand eight hundred kilocal in the under fifteens and three thousand kilocal per day in the under eighteens uh with differences and values between the studies likely due to differences in the recording of dietary information and nutrition analysis um could i have the next slide please in the senior men recorded energy intakes mirror the training load data with mean total energy intake being significantly higher on a match day compared to a wrist or training day in plays playing in the dutch league and the english league on the graph there from anderson's study the energy intakes around 3800 on a match day compared to around 2 900 on a training day while in the study of the players in the dutch league the absolute values were lower but the gap between the match and the non-match days was approximately the same at around 500 to 600 kilocalories again differences between study likely due to reporting and different nutritional software all these studies um across the different age groups and the different sectors emphasize that there are large individual variations in energy expenditure and intake across the players even when playing in similar positions so although these values can be used as a starting point to guide us as practitioners on how much energy or calories your player may need to to eat it's important that the requirements need to be individualized and adjusted for match day and trading and rest days accordingly as mentioned earlier glycogen and carbohydrates are key in nutrients and substrates for fueling football so carbohydrates are not only the primary fuel source for muscle during intermittent exercise but they are also the primary fuel source for the brain so as a sport that also includes skill tactics and decision making adequate carbohydrate intake is important for optimal cognitive function as well as maximizing physiological performance and minimizing fatigue the carbohydrate recommendations have shifted away from a higher carbohydrate intake every day to a more periodized approach um changing it relative to training or match demands some training days will be a lower intensity or a tactical session and a lower carbohydrate intake would be appropriate in these instances while on a match day a minimum of around six grams per kilogram of carbohydrates is advised um exceptions to this might be in the preseason where training duration and intensity is likely to be higher or when there's a high number of games are played over a short period of time and there might be insufficient time for complete muscle glycogen recent assist between matches so for instance within two games within 48 hours or in tournaments where there's a game a day in senior mail athletes the difference in energy intake in the english premier league players appears to come mainly from changes in carbohydrate intake throughout the course of the week with match day carbohydrate around 6 grams per kilogram compared to 4 grams per kilogram on training days so this may appear as though the players were meeting their requirements but for that study this was a week where two games were played so it's likely that they didn't optimize muscle glycogen storage and the lead up and recovery from those games and players competing in the dutch league training day carbohydrate intake was similar to those observed in the premier league players but match day intake did not meet recommended guidelines and it's important to note that this is data that's collected during competition and pre-season and takes yet to be established there isn't a comparison of training to match day carbohydrate intake and female junior players and female players regardless of their age every carbohydrate intake is reported as being less than six grams per kilogram indicating that there's inadequate fueling for matches and or heavy training days and this is supported by the data from the most study published this year where carbohydrate intake was the same on a match day compared to a risk day and i suppose what's more concerning here is the proportion of athletes consuming a low carbohydrate intake on a matching heavy training day with 5 out of 13 players having less than 3 grams per kilogram which is half of the recommended amount for a match day an academy players carbohydrate intake relative to body mass decreases as age increases again potentially leading to some under fuelling in the under 18s for on matches one study by briggs did compare carbohydrate intake across a competition and training week with no difference observed between matches and training days in the under 15 under 16 age group protein requirements for footballers are similar for other sports ranging from 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body mass per day higher intakes might be required if an athlete is trying to maintain muscle mass while in a calorie deficit to maximize muscle protein synthesis it's recommended to distribute the protein intake evenly throughout the day at about 0.3 grams per kilogram or around 20 gram serves every three hours um and although there's some evidence that after whole body or germ resistance training a higher dose of 0.4 grams per kilogram should be consumed meanwhile there's recent work into pre-sleep protein indicating 40 grams of protein consumed within 30 to 60 minutes of going to be as effective and stimulating muscle protein sense of this overnight insignia men protein intakes are consistent across the day of the week regardless if it's a training or match day with intakes ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 grams per kg depending on the study while the graph there shows that regardless of the type of day whether it's training or natural rest protein intake tends to be skewed with the highest syntax always at dinner with snacks and breakfast often not medium the 20 grams or 0.3 gram per kilo recommendation protein intakes appear to be on the higher end and academy players with studies reporting intakes from 1.6 to 2.2 and 2.1 to 2.5 grams per kilogram across the various age groups and the different studies there's minimal differences in relative protein intake across the different age groups and similar to the senior players protein intake is lowest at breakfast and highest at dinner in female players protein intake appears to be also adequate with professional players consuming more than the junior elite um i wasn't able to find any within day distribution data but from experience with female athletes in other sports there would likely be the same pattern of low protein and breakfast and highest similar to their male counterparts there are nice football specific recommendations for dietary fat intake with research advising that should be in line with public health guidelines overall average fair intake is similar across the age groups and sixes and with consistent intakes across the competition week and higher fat intakes may be required if an athlete is in a period of high energy expenditure or growth i'm not going to go into a lot of detail mac nutrients but there are some that have been highlighted of interest to all athletes not just footballers you want to encourage athletes to eat a varied diet in order to achieve appropriate intake of vitamins and minerals but there are some populations or dietary patterns that can put some players at an increased risk of a deficiency so iodine efficiency which can compromise performance due to impaired muscle function and lower work capacity so athletes with lower energy intakes female athletes with the regular menstrual cycle and vegetarian and vegan athletes are a higher risk of having low iron stores the sunshine vitamin vitamin d which is important for bone health and immune function for peace so people who live further from the equator increased risk of deficiency in the autumn and winter as well as athletes who may train and play outdoors with long sleeves and leggings covering their arms and legs throughout the year calcium which is important for muscle contraction growth and bone health especially in those adolescent academy players low intakes are associated with restricted energy intake disordered eating or avoidance of dairy products and other calcium-rich foods which could result in inadequate intakes and finally vitamin b12 which is important for dna synthesis and the development of mature red blood cells dietary sources are animal based so would be need to be supplemented if the player is following a vegan or heavy plant-based diet moving on to fueling the performance um it's not just about game day we need to consider what the player eats the day before the match um a higher carbohydrate intake's been advised um the literature in the range of seven to 12 or six to 10 grams per kilogram to maxify to maximize glycogen stores especially if it's a two game week with the goals of match day nutrition to minimize any gut discomfort and ensure that players are starting the match with the full fuel tank similar to other team sports pre-match meal should be high in carbohydrate aiming for around two grams per kilogram body mass so within that one to four that's often recommended for all sports it should contain some protein and below in foods that are too high in fat and fiber as this will likely slow digestion and may leave athletes feeling full but not well fuelled so typically past your rice based dishes using tomato based sauces or alternatives such as decorated milk instead of cream and sauces to reduce the fat content if you have athletes that find eating within three hours is too close or they get nervous or have trouble with stomach discomfort then liquid meals such as smoothies and soups are good options provided they're still getting a similar amount of carbohydrates a top-up is often recommended whether it's gels jelly sports drinks or fruit and this would also be just before warm up or before the players into the tunnel depending on preference logistics and availability it's recommended during the match that players consume 30 to 60 grams per hour or at minimum 60 grams for the whole match sports drinks might be preferred as you're getting both carbs and fluids but other options include simple to consume and digest carbs such as gels or gummies during the match typically there's only a small window to get fuel on boards mainly at half time so i need to take this into consideration and think about how to encourage fuel intake whether it's having bottles lined up by the door in the changing room um so they can just grab them as they walk in or having gels with tops already open so they just have to squeeze them into their mouth after the match you want to incorporate the four hours repair review or rehydrate and revitalize for nutrition recovery they're pretty self-explanatory so rehydrate with fluids we fuel the tank with carbs repair muscle damage with protein and revitalize means to incorporate vitamins and minerals and antioxidants through fruit and veg or maybe some targeted supplements the strategy or on how aggressive you are in terms of nutrition recovery depends on your schedule if there's a week between games and a couple of days until your next training session you can probably be more relaxed especially if it's a night game as you might want to prioritize sleep if however there's another match within two days you probably need to be more aggressive to ensure that they've restored enough muscle glycogen for the next game carbohydrate and turk will likely also need to be high on the rest days or the training day after the match otherwise they risk starting the next match under field so what are players doing at the moment we only have the match day breakdown for senior males and the epl with the dark bars it's an 8 p.m kickoff the white bars are 4 pm which is 2 days later and if we look at the pre-match meal they're not meeting that 2 gram per kilogram recommendation during the game the average was just under 50 grams of carbs intake with only two of the six players reaching 30 grams per hour and in the post-match recovery meal the kickoff time does play a role carb intake was a lot higher and meeting recommendations following the 4 pm kickoff but not the 8pm kickoff there we're both the post-match snack and the meal were less than 1.2 grams per kg quickly on supplements we promote a food first but not necessarily a food-only process sometimes supplements will need to be used to correct a diagnosed nutrition deficiency sports foods are often commonly used in times of convenience to aid rapid refuelling or recovery while traveling while ergogenic aids targeting performance there's strong evidence supporting caffeine and creatine use in team sports and there are two excellent open access reviews with the references there on screen which i direct you to for more detail on ergogenic supplements and team and sport performance so overall be mindful their energy and carbohydrate requirements vary across the week and should match training and match demands most players are meeting their fat and protein requirements but carb intake is often low so as practitioners we need to think about how we can encourage them and get them to buy into meeting their carbohydrate needs and protein intake is often good but this brutal distribution throughout the day may need to be improved match day nutrition often begins the day before or even two days if the match has already been played that week and encourage fueling during the match where possible and think about how to make it easier for the players to fuel and remember in the four hours of recovery and how aggressive you are with your recovery strategies will be dictated often by your competition schedule so thank you everyone thanks so much yeah i was really engrossed i wanted you to keep going and but thanks so much a really clear presentation and have given some great recommendations for practitioners that might be attending and we have had some questions come through if you're still thinking of some then please just keep sending them and we'll be answering or be asking the questions at the end of both speakers so and thanks again julia we'll move on to rob's presentation so just to give robert an introduction he's a senior lecturer in sports exercise and nutrition sciences at the university of huddersfield and also works as a performance nutritionist within elite football and rob completed his phd with liverpool football club investigating their eating habits of elite youth football players whilst working as the academy nutritionist rob currently works as the performance nutritionist at glasgow celtic football club a role he's held since 2016. and today rob's gonna focus on hydration and hydration for football so you can take it away rob thank you thanks for introduction becca good morning or good evening depending where you are and thank you julia for that introduction to football and i'll move on to my slides now on hydration okay go to the next slide please okay so i think hydration is generally an area that most players and coaches have a good idea that's important but we often don't see them sticking maybe to the scientific recommendations that are given and as julia mentioned football's in intimate in sport periods of high intensity reload intensity but what's particularly about football is the competition and the amount of competition that these players play we think of the recent restart the premier league some teams will play in the game every three or four days could have the next line please so first of all what is dehydration uh the is dehydration is divined defined sorry as a reaction involving the looks of a water molecule or lots of body water an athlete is often considered dehydrated when we see acute losses of body mass of one or two percent so if you've done a bout of exercise and you've weighed yourself pre and post you see that that mass is decreased that's not going to be for a loss of fat mass or muscle mass but it's actually just going to be losses in water get the next slide please so in terms of fluid loss in sweat sweat's vitally important as part of our thermal regulation and sweat sweating is one of the most effective ways in which we lose body heat and it's important to maintain homeostasis within the body there's a huge individual variance when it comes to sweating you might know know it yourself when you're playing football or any other sports or someone you actually want to particularly sweat it then you might have someone who looks like they're not even broken and sweat so it can vary depending on the person now there is some data in other sports such as marathon brothers that shows that there's a correlation between the amount that one person might sweat compared to their completion time so we see better completion times with those who sweat a little bit more as i said it's hugely individual if we think of football it might depend on their position what they're meant to do so we're probably going to see a higher sweating uh from a full back which may be up and down the wing compared to maybe the goalkeeper who's stuck in the box and doesn't do too much clap the next slide please so here we just have a little look at the sweat loss at different temperatures okay so this exercise was performed for 60 minutes around 16 70 percent of the 02 max football averages out around 70 percent field suite max but as mentioned before it's intermittent so we have areas of really high intensity in our as a lower intensity now we consider that many football tournaments such as the world cup uh the euros over different continents and competitions take place in the summer we're probably looking at higher temperatures around the 30 to 35 and we can see when we look at the average sweat loss around there we're approaching them to three liters which is a huge amount i just want to bear in bear that in mind for some of the recommendations that we're going to have coming up soon can we move to the next slide please so some of the reported effects that go alongside dehydration is mainly affecting our aerobic capacity hopefully this is often dependent on the severity of the dehydration we also need to note that when we compete in warm environments we can have someone who is dehydrated so that means they're fully hydrated they can still see performance decrements so it's not necessarily just down to uh dehydration it might be as a result of the heat so with some of these it might help with different cooling techniques so again when you see warmth at warm temperature tournaments it might be a wet towel it might be taking an ice beverage things like that on the aim is not necessary to rehydrate just but to help to cool the body down now this is where we get a little bit and a paradox really with with hydration because alberto glassy completed uh a marathon in berlin a couple years ago set the world record and he actually seen a 10 uh decreasing his body mass so quite dehydrated that's quite severe damage dehydration and whilst i'm not recommending that at all there's also with some sports hydration is perhaps overstated a little bit more than it needs to be and there's not a huge amount of evidence in football so we're just going to have a little look at what we can take from that so go to the next slide please so as i mentioned before most athletes and coaches are aware that reduction the body's water content so dehydration impairs performance for anyone who's ever taken partnership on a hot day they probably heard their colleagues and their coaches may encourage them to take what's wrong a mild dehydration one two percent might go unnoticed and it's we've got to think as well how the sport goes who we mentioned before within football fuel opportunities are few and far between we only really have of time so it might be that we need to adapt and get the pledge ready to to compete in these in these circumstances and there is a risk of hypothermia a small risk but there is a risk of explain what that is on the next slide please okay so hyping the dream is a condition that occurs when we the level of sodium within the blood is abnormally low we generally will get high glutamine if we're just taking on huge amounts of water so it's not a condition that we believe comes from excessive losses of sodium during sweating or from taking on too much water and typically this is rare as i mentioned and it has but it has been reported in some endurance events such as marathon and michael willing and iron man excess to intake of water if we have happening treatment that is maintained it can in extreme circumstances result in death and we've actually seen that in some competitions where it's been electricity people trying to drink the most water that they can and what happens is when we have a low sodium in the blood we have higher sodium concentrations in the cells and what we see there is a the cells begin to swell by taking excess water and disrupt and uh can also become extremely damaged can we go to the next slide please so just quickly on the roll of sodium i'm going to touch on this again later on with some recommendations it's one of the major electrolytes in the body as i mentioned we have a higher concentration with the extracellular fluid than the intracellular fluid involved in muscle contractions for the sodium potassium pump we can lose around one to two grams per liter or more than sweat so you might have heard this term before are you a salty sweater and gatorade and jssi are now looking at some different sweat rates of individuals sports drink contain around 10 to 25 millimoles per liter which probably isn't adequate to replace that sodium that we're losing so we're going to look at some strategies that we can work on that go to the next slide please to some of the benefits of adding sodium it can increase the profitability of the drink or the food it helps maintain first and that can help promote the athlete to drink to some extent can help prevent hyponatremia increase the rate of water absorption increase retention of fluid which is important for the rehydration that's who we mentioned earlier i make some contribution to the offsetting of sodium losses in sweat so we've talked about what dehydration is why it potentially could be an issue but how do we know if we are becoming dehydrated so we go to the next slide please so how do we try and measure this so there are a couple of measures i'm going to concentrate on two ones that are pretty easy to do and everyone who's listening to this can do this themselves and then one that might be a bit a little bit more scientific so go to the next slide please so as i mentioned before simply weighing body mass so acute body mass and changes reflects a height to someone's hydration status so what you could do is have that athlete weigh themselves pre-exercise and pokes exercise now this might not always be convenient and before a match you know players are going for their routine the coaches try to speak to them me as nutritionists go around for a pair of scales asking someone to jump on is probably not feasible but you might have an idea of what that player is they could do previously before they arrived at the ground they could do it at the hotel pokes exercise again a little bit difficult if it's been a any loss to a last-minute penalty trying to implement nutrition techniques can be difficult as it is never mind going around with scales so it might be something you do back at the hotel and or when the player gets home but it's easy it's cheap it's an indirect method i'm going to explain how we'd use that data a little later on and go to the next line please simply have a look at the urine colour and when you go to the toilet it can be a little bit of individual very variation from my experience of dealing with this it's a very rough in the indication of hydration status and typically that the darker the urine okay the more likely that person is dehydrated obviously there's there's no cost with it can be done by the athlete themselves or probably something that you want to work with someone on strength trying to get an idea for example if someone takes a vitamin c tablet and then goes to the toilet often the urine color can be affected by that so it's just something to bear in mind that the dietary habits of the individual might affect it as well we go to the next slide please in urine specific gravity i feel like doing this test is a bit of a right of passage for any sports nutritionist or any sports scientist i remember being an intern and football clubs have to do this quite often and so what you do is get a urine sample and from a from the athlete and you drop it as we just see here on factomometer that will give you a score so if we go over 1.025 that's indicating dehydration however there are individual variations with this i have had dealt with certain players that the score is kind of always around the dehydration market how much water he seems to drink i mentioned earlier we don't want people drinking excessive amounts of water for no reason if players know we're getting tested as well often that morning they make a specific effort to drink more water so it might actually not be a reflection of their habits so i don't know how valuable this always is and also you all think of the time that it might take to do this test it might be better just to use the other two methods and try and educate your athletes can move to the next slide please just look at some of the recommendations around hydration um and they're going to be quite varied as you see here from our typical textbooks and just go to the next slide please so we just look at some of the recommendations here now granted visa based over a long period of time here over 30 years but we can see quite a difference and trying to think how we could implement some of these is quite difficult to do so just if i just pick out a couple here and abundance amount before during and after and from pollock and wilmore figure that might affect the stomach try to start drinking longer before you feel thirsty it's kind of hard to estimate when you're going to feel thirsty and according to weight changes how we're going to do that within competition it's quite difficult and we look at one of the a couple of the most recent ones drinking to match sweat rate now you had to test so you knew what your sweat rate was previously you may be loved to do that but you already mentioned before our opportunities to take on um nutritional products and water during the football match a few and far between and trying to take on 150 to 300 mil every 10 to 15 minutes i mean just think of that yourself if you're trying to take on that body of water as your exercise it's going to be pretty difficult to do that before it was showing sweat rates of up to three liters within 60 minutes now imagine trying to replace that only three liters of water as you're playing football game that's going to be pretty difficult i might listen with some stomach issues let me go to the next slide please as julia pointed out before we're looking when it comes to preparing for a match day we've got the pre-match during and post and what's most important here is carbohydrates they have a key fuel here and and it actually might be that we use hydration some drinks as a method to get more carbohydrates into into the body so can we go to the event slide please so queen to match the advice should be focused on nutrition the previous 24 hours this certificate we look for that carbohydrate load so when we're looking at that carbohydrate though it's important also taking hydration on to help store those carbohydrates as muscle glycogen so for every gram that we look to store within the muscle in the liver we're looking for approximately three milliliters of water it's probably important to know that a lot of the foods that the players will be having we'll have water content as well such as if we think of pasta we think of rice but what they say here is if you can get if you encourage your plates to have a drink with every meal might be an easy way to incorporate some carbohydrates so have a sports drink on the day before and during training i might be having smoothies throughout the day and just try and increase the amount that they have we're eating when we're going to kick off around six milliliters per kilo of body mass okay with water but again i just encourage them to have what they help with the meal if you're working as a nutritionist with the team it might be a good idea to be there pre-match some of the games to try and get an idea of what their habits are as we mentioned before we prove we're self-recorded um and nutrition intakes often we don't get the full picture also when we talk about the day before i've had players before that if it's an earlier kickoff they'll say 12 o'clock kickoff they'll try and drink a lot of water and take a lot of fluids on the night before then they find themselves getting up a lot a lot of time during the night to go to the toilet which is obviously disrupting their sleep are they then coming in as well rested to the game as they could be so just little things to consider there okay the next slide please so during during the game this this can be quite difficult um there's sometimes drinks break so with the restart for the premier league service drinks breaks around 22 and a half minutes so about halfway through the first half and same for the second half uh the weather here wasn't great so we don't know how long necessarily much it was needed it was often really used as a tactical tactical break well again at what i'd say you'd probably have to get carbohydrates on not necessarily looking at hydration it'd just be that might be through fluids that was the mode of how we got carbohydrate on there's a lot of gels that are available as well that provides a certain amount of hydration what you could do is have bottles placed around the pitch in the goal with the goalkeeper when the physio goes on you often see them bringing on some drinks and they're normally labeled which one have carbohydrates in which ones might be just electrolyte based at half time obviously there's an opportunity there but we have to consider how much they're taking on so we don't want players necessarily having the full bottle of the sports drink which is 500 milliliters as that's sitting in the stomach might just be a little bit uncomfortable give them a stitch when you go back out as i said as i say the priority is carbohydrates just trying to get some carbohydrates on to electrolytes probably the work one of the worst things they can take at half time is just having water with the electrolytes what you could do is try and condense them a little bit more so you have electrolyte tablets useful in a smaller body of water so they don't have to take on quite as much move to the next slide please and just one thing i want to stress here that any in-game strategies hydration carbohydrates that they generate it's vitally important to practice eastern training first time someone tries a certain nutritional strategy it should not be in the game because it could lead to a decrease in performance the player feeling ill and as a nutritionist then you lose a little bit of trust with the player and potentially the coach as well and move on to the next slide please and just to touch on post-match um rehydration before the kr's a lot of time we'll go along with the other ones as well so repair if you'll revitalize so you'll be looking for some protein and carbohydrates and hydration a recovery drink is a great way to get this in from personal experience i find somebody will prefer to have a shake at first they'll struggle to get food down we're looking to rehydrate so we want elements of sodium in there to help them retain that water so what this could be is not necessarily adding further sodium to the drink but the food that is available it could be have some salty snacks or a little bit of salt on the foods that can often help with this idea of the problems of the food also to stimulate first next slide please i think that's my final slide so it's going just to the key points dehydration can negatively affect performance but it's often when it's quite severe so small amounts of dehydration don't appear to have a huge effect which is something that might have an individual variation it may be beneficial to monet hydration straighters through weigh-ins and urine assessment i think this would probably be a good idea during tournament play or when there are a number of games in close proximity to just check there's not accumulation effective dehydration so what i mean by that is if someone comes dehydrated just a little bit each day eventually that's going to add up to potentially high high losses in body mass pretty much look for six to eight mils per kilogram and my body mass about two or three hours before and then just topping up sleeping maybe on a sports drink or a carbohydrate gel beforehand during the match but for breaks in play and half time important to have alongside carbohydrates and electrolytes carbohydrates is the key and be sure to practice any techniques that you recommend to your athletes oxmatch in terms of hydration are looking for approximately 1.5 liters per kilogram that is lost with the addition of sodium i believe that's that's the end of my presentation thank you for listening thanks so much and i think two talks that have really complemented each other say thank you and rob i think you gave some great recommendations for um getting that hydration on board especially in somewhere like the philippines where they're often exercising or training or competing in really hot conditions so obviously their sweat rates are going to be higher so definitely some hydration recommendations that people can can take home today and we have had some questions in so um i'll i'll go through them the first one um is for both of you and one thing that we haven't really discussed in either presentation is when games go into extra time which we do see is quite common especially in a tournament setting and so maybe if i go to you first what do you think are the hydration considerations when games do you go into extra time yeah that's a good question and my colleague liam harper does a lot of research every time so be annoyed that i didn't bring it up uh what we do what i've done with with players is we kind of give them the option so we'll give them your sure what type of drink they might want so is it a fully carbohydrate drink or is it just an electrolyte drink again we'll try and do condensed versions so don't take too much on and but then we'll also ask them what all the form of carbohydrate that might be it might be some jelly babies it might be a carbohydrate gel once somebody asks for a positive honey and thankful for that game didn't go to extra time so we didn't have to all we needed the impression on the pitch but we'll have that and then as soon as the it's coming towards the time the sports science support staff will come and give that to the player again it's more just to make sure we get something on um obviously when we're going to 120 minutes the risk of dehydration is a bit more pronounced so it's just trying to to keep an eye out yes on the players and just promote that with the break within the half time as well because they're taking on some form of hydration but predominantly the main thing for me would be to push the intake of carbohydrates thanks so yeah julia and rob's obviously touched up on the nutrition side but what about also like the nutrition for maybe like the cognition as as games go into extra time or even penalties if you could comment on that yeah as rob sort of mentioned it is just trying to promote that carbohydrate intake it's going to be that really that's the fuel for the brain as obviously dehydration also affects cognition as well so just encouraging them to get that food that carbs on board and having those options there so that they can choose what they want because then they're most likely to have it if it's in a form that they actually want to take it in thanks and then more specific to nutrition julia what was your nutrition recommendations for someone that might be following a plant-based diet or if you've got time to also comment on maybe like a high-fat keto diet yeah um so with the plant-based diets they're probably going to be meeting their carbohydrate requirements i suppose that's one side of eating more plant-based you're eating a lot more more grains so it's probably more protein intake that they might need to have to be considerate of and making sure that they get in their protein sources from a wide variety of plant foods because they don't always have to submit to make sure that you're getting all the amino acids um the essential amino acids um and then with the keto more high fat diet i think the athletes themselves might notice that they might feel a bit sluggish or they might not be able to just kick on or accelerate as as much so it's just working with them and maybe getting them to try right you've tried the keto diet few a few times in training how's it making you feel maybe incorporate some carbohydrate um and maybe just working with the athletes getting them to buy in and encouraging them to see if they can notice a difference within their own performance um in their own mood as well yeah because from a research perspective obviously there's been some research looking at high fat diet and performance in endurance athlete but from my understanding of what i know there's not anything in team support athletes yet is there not them i'm aware of but even with their endurance based research they're still working at a high percentage of of their vo two max you know um it's about 80 80 um and so they they are using some of that carbohydrate still in order to to get their performance advantage so i think that will translate to team sports yeah that's a really good question um rob um a question for you have you got any recommendations as to how we can avoid um over hydration or hyper hydration yeah i guess a good mention that typically to go by is drinking to first i'm not just thinking if there is a break in play or is it if it is a half time just like i have to get um any kind of limits on so drinking first is a pretty good measure for most people that would be might still need a little bit of work with nutritionists to work on that we've as i mentioned before we've evolved to kind of be able to cope with a certain level of dehydration um and the the idea of trying to just push it before first for me i don't i just don't think it's necessary particularly within football so i just encourage them probably not to have a huge amount of water and kind of a little bit linked to the point julie just made i think a lot of time that you'll think you'll know you've drawn too much you'll feel in your stomach uh when you're trying to start running around so probably trying to take a few mouthfuls listening to whatever the coach is saying talking amongst your colleagues and players and i think that's it really i don't feel nothing more scientific than just just going to first and i'm not just chucking down a full bottle of water do you with like your experience of working um with a club and and i don't know whether you measure players sweat rates um but have you ever tried to do like personalized fluid recommendations if you do know a player's sweat rate is it feasible does it work in an appliance we i've i've not personally had any experience with it just from a the kind of from from the research that i've seen i've not seen a huge amount for the individual visualization of currently and also just from a time perspective trying to get through a full squad of players would be pretty difficult there was one player who had particular issues with ever drinking anything and that's because he really struggled with anything cold so it had to be like room temperature drinks and things like that we came up with a bit of a rough plan for that individual it was mainly aimed at trying to increase the carbohydrate intake than supposed to solely fluid but we didn't have any data to go from from his sweat rates and so he's just kind of a very general try and take this on these periods to play he was a winger actually so we used to leave it at the side of the pitch for him as well so then he'd just try and take on different points but again as i've mentioned before it's it's not it wasn't necessarily a huge amount of dehydration it was because that was his kind of choice of carbohydrates he didn't like gels didn't like to have jelly babies or anything sweeter in the game so by him restricting his fluid he was also restricting his carbohydrate intake as well yeah and i guess like we are talking football here and as you've both mentioned like the opportunity to take on board fluid and nutrition is extremely limited so it's kind of use trying to get on in the right moments or whenever whenever you can and we have had a previous webinar on carbohydrate malfriends um julia i wondered whether you could comment on whether you think that could be a good strategy for football um i think just because the duration of a football match uh you probably need to actually ingest the carbohydrate i think to get more of the benefits from it i think the mouth rinse is really useful maybe for some shorter duration activities and if you think you know you take into account the warm up as well as a match and then potentially they might be going into extra time as well um i think they really need to actually take the fuel on on board so the mouth rinse might help with the sensation um but i think they'll notice it more towards particularly the back end of the game if they actually haven't digested and absorbed the carbohydrate yeah rob anything to add on that one yeah i'd completely agree with what julia said yes it was we've used manfred's as like a last resort so when players really struggle to take things on such as that individual you'll do a man friends i think it's when you see players do a lot so you know you'll see players go and grab a bottle take it and then they'll spit a lot of it out as a nutritionist you like please just drink it but um it might be useful when they're trying to take things on such as maybe when it's in the game itself i mean not to relate back to my own personal stuff because i played a game of football last night and i really struggled to take anything on so my friends sometimes might work for me and if you're in hot environments i think sometimes people struggle with the stomach a little bit so i'd agree with you try to get the fuel on if you can but if last resort a mouthful it is not the worst option and then obviously like with your applied experience do you do any of the carbohydrate personalization throughout the season considering like differences in pre-season compared to when it's during season um not not for the team i'm currently with because we would typically play nearly three games every week for the full season um so it's pretty full-on from domestic and european competition never looked because they haven't been scottish we've ever break at christmas so it's at least a bit more of a packed schedule on the points so to be honest my biggest issue with most of time is ab eating enough carbohydrates which as any nutritionist will tell you that that's a great position to be in it's uh it's when then you're dealing with maybe players who are not as in as involved with the squad where you try and structure it probably a little bit more and so try and get that with those plans but just from the shade volume of games in football i think a lot of the time it's it goes into this a few and far between of squad rotation etc so i don't use a huge amount of carbohydrate periodization but i find similar to what we found in the data in the paper with lame anderson footballers kind of regulate this themselves a little bit again just through making the correct choices so what we'll try and do is maybe if we are in a period of not as many games or lower intensity training the options that will be available in the canteen at breakfast and lunch they might change so it's not as bushy when we're looking for that carbohydrate load you know you count what two steps of our carbohydrate being shifting your face whereas on other days we'll take that away and we find that kind of regulates it a bit easier than giving people an individual number plant kind of thing yeah you can kind of guide it depending on where you what food you place in the canteen at the right stages and one thing that i've noticed on both of your like your history or your your career so far is that you've worked with both youth and senior athletes and maybe if i could ask both you know i'll go to you first julia what what educational what one thing would you always implement at an academy stage to set them up for success in their senior career um if i have access to a kitchen i think like practical workshops are fantastic way to just try and develop some cooking skills and you can always make it a competition because then it gets them really engaged because they always want to win um and beat their teammates so and then and include some nutrition education elements getting them to explain why you know why are we having rice with this meal or how else can you use it um to full recovery um as well and get them that way i think that's definitely really really valuable um and if not just trying to don't have access to a kitchen then getting mentors or um senior players that they look up to hopefully come in and and talk about their nutrition experience as well because they'll often you know probably take on board something that someone they idolize is saying compared to what i'm trying to say um as well yeah thanks robin i think that you would say to academy uh no pretty much uh same any kind of competition we did a supermarket sweep thing one time and it was down absolute storm um i think uh one thing that i probably didn't do enough when i first was at the academy it was actually telling them the why as well so not just being too dictatory if i you know have these type of foods that actually trust the young athletes of why they're doing it but also getting their parents involved as well because ultimately for a lot of these athletes of who are under 17 18 they're not buying the food they're probably not cooking the food that often and so trying to get a parent buy-in as well but with similar things as julia mentioned yeah that's a great point because you can do all you can do with these players but then when they go home to their parents they're going to eat what their parents put on the table so yeah educating the parents as well sounds like a great idea and we're actually at that hour i feel like we could continue but that's all we've got time for today so just want to say thank you so much to both of you for um presenting um it's a really enjoyable hour um and had a great discussion i'd also like to thank all of the um attendees for turning up today and and just a reminder that if you've attended three or more webinars and we will be sending out a certificate to people that have attended and we do have two more webinars coming up so if this is your first one please join us for the following two to ensure that you need to get your certificate and so again thank you so much julia thanks rob um for a great session and um our next webinar will be held on the 29th of september so we've got a three week gap until the next one and we'll be focusing on basketball where we'll be taking the the theory into practice um for nutrition and also for coaching so please join us then on the 29th and so thanks again guys and we'll be back on the 29th of september thanks baker thanks becca [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]

excellent gluten free alternative to wheat flour perfect for making breads cookies etc especially if you're following a ketogenic lifestyle you will need about 2 teaspoons of baking powder and you will need a stick of butter or a tablespoons of butter 6 large eggs at room temperature and a variety of spices of your choice and Himalayan salt or sea salt I've got some garlic powder some some Banting spices Cajun and lemon and herb and some herbs you can use any flavor you like just make it your own into the bowl you're going to add in 1 cup of coconut flour you could have half a cup coconut flour if you'd like to increase the size of the bread I'm adding a cup of the flour for adding its 2 teaspoons of baking powder [Music] this is where you can personalize your bread I'm just gonna add some herbs some garlic powder [Music] you can use about a teaspoon or two depending on how you like it a Malayan salt any use some venting Cajun spice which has no carbs in which is really great [Music] [Music] given the dry ingredients a good mix and we'll set this aside and move on to the next step it's football I'm gonna add in six eggs you can't beat your eggs for about a minute and a half till it's nice and bubbly this is what it should look up after you've beaten up about a minute and a half next we're going to mouth stick of butter in the microwave and slowly add it into the egg mixture using the hand mixer you do not hear a hen malicious use a whisk will do the same job [Music] okay guys now we are going to add in our wet mixture the egg and butter mixture into the dry ingredients and using a hand mixer we're going to just beat that slowly going to add that in very slowly [Music] [Music] get yourself a loaf pair where you're gonna grease with either coconut oil or some coconut spray to keep it low carb or some batter and I'm just gonna pour in your mixture your bread mix it into a loaf pan in the meantime pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 108 degrees Celsius and you're gonna cook your bread for 40 to 50 minutes [Music] our brain is now ready to face the ovens like I said just pop it into your oven for about 40 to 50 minutes and that's it guys and the wonderful thing is this bread that it contains one point five net carbs the slides have it with some butter however you like that leads to note is low carb is ketogenic friendly Banting friendly Eskom trendy and it's delicious so guys I've just taken the bread at the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes and I'm going to cut it up I left it in the oven a little too long but make sure to check on it about 35 minutes 40 minutes into baking your bread so let's cut a delicious low carb bread sound say about it inch is about 1.5 knit carbs so you can have a couple of slices of these guys and if you're craving britain or miss having something up there then this is a perfect mix of people [Music] I just give you one more tip if you want to make a loaf of bread that is more larger a little bit wider its make a sandwich I highly recommend it a narrow loaf pan and your bread will rise better as you know coconut flour is not the same as a regular wheat flour but the health benefits guys this is only one point five net carbs per slice compared to regular bread with spikes with insulin and very high glucose and sugar etc and all the things that they put in regular bread and you want sandwich [Music] between the lines [Music] okay stop dwelling on MC words stop starting to go ahead that's all the crews [Music]", "zCDChgQaY0M": "everybody this is Stacey with our unscripted reviews and we are making the first of our three Super Bowl Sunday appetizers right we're turning the oven on to 400 degrees we're making a keto friendly version of tater tots that are not tater they are broccoli so we'll have a link to the recipe below using our own bread crumb recipe that is not really bread crumbs so we start out with 10 ounces of broccoli and I kind of went the lazy route and went to Trader Joe's and bought the rice broccoli I did rinse it get a little bit of water in it otherwise you're suppose to boil it you're supposed to basically blanch it so you boil it in hot water for a minute then throw it in the cold water so you shock it then after that you chop it up really fine I didn't want to do that that's why I bought the rice broccoli so we pour in our breadcrumbs [Music] you have everything in the bowl we're gonna mix it all together with the spatula don't really look like a Tater Tot it gets a tortured so we finished the first row and I go ahead and do the rest of them Oh we'll be right back you all right so we got about 23 I'm a little bigger you can make them a little smaller these are ready to go so we're gonna put them in the oven at 400 for about 20 we'll put them in for 20 minutes and check on them all right so different types of sausage you can probably eat these with I would recommend maybe some sugar-free ketchup sugar free barbecue sauce maybe if you have any homemade ranch dressing recipes go ahead and try that not real sure what else maybe if you like mustard and you can find a keto friendly mustard that could be good to get Oh friendly okay apparently all mustard is keto friendly I don't eat mustard so I don't know maybe even a cheese sauce I mean they do have cheese in them so maybe maybe like a queso cheese that sounds really really good and then we will have the macros posted below for you so you can know how many you know in a serving recommended and how it's gonna affect your carb count and everything else for the day all right our broccoli tots have come out of the oven with our breading breading mix they have some Parmesan cheese in it so it kind of spreads a little bit so they look a little more like broccoli blobs but let's go ahead and give one a try break pretty easy no pretty good they're really good actually by themselves but I would definitely think I would definitely think if you dip it in something else it'll be even better what do you think it's things like broccoli no it's a tastes better than broccoli that's not comparable I don't think we're not any times Lake hazards of that SIA taste of broccoli but if it was if a biscuit and a brown a piece of broccoli and a baby this is Bob would you like a biscuit Abu Ali miss golly golly no Brock Brocket it's a bracket so you need them you're gonna eat them for dinner all right so Ireland's gonna try the broccoli tots what was that face that was Lucy sitting on the tripod and and me and gopal you know what you know what before you that you should know that that's Bravo yeah I know that it's called the broccolis good Matt in top form all right we'll be back with Gregg with our second recipe all right guys we're onto the recipe number two this one you're gonna need some dill pickles the baby gun you're gonna need some bacon do I have your full attention cream cheese staple of all good keto recipes these are the baby pickles that I'm using you need some garlic and you're gonna need some cheddar cheese so lots of cheese bacon wrapped baby dill pickles these are gonna be good I know this you're gonna want to use well you can use any kind of bacon you want you can use the thin bacon I have the thick cut here but because of the fact that we don't want to overcook this pickle it's gonna probably explode if we cook it long enough with a thick cut bacon so I'm gonna go ahead and pre cook this a little bit probably like 10 minutes just to get it about halfway there and then we'll come back and we'll do some combatant combination stuff we're bad guys all right so I went ahead and cheated and got ahead of you a little bit baby pickles we're gonna go ahead and slice them lengthwise so you get two halves then I used a grapefruit spoon you can use a knife doesn't really matter I find this safer because I'm gonna hurt myself less with this that's been a knife and you just want to pry out cut along and basically remove the innards of the pickle I know I'm sad you can save these make them into a good relish or something like that I usually eat them but once you get the inside out into the inside-out you end up with basically a cavity that you can use and that's where all the other stuff is I mentioned the bacon precooked that a little bit make sure it's still bendable which it is then we're taking a whole 8 ounces of cream cheese softened combining it with a half of 3 half a cups my assistant didn't set that up very well so there's 1/2 cup to 1/2 cup yeah let's call that 3 1/2 cup luckily I have an assistant down here on the floor will take care of that other mess so we got that we got that we're gonna add one clove of garlic minced we're gonna add that in I like to add a little salt and pepper you don't have to know where my shaker is black pepper all right so we're gonna mix this up so we get close to this consistency we're ready to go to the next step I'm just gonna take a fork phone we're just gonna basically your head jalapeno poppers same sir principle right here basically overfilling them because these things are small you can use bigger pickles if you want but generally these are finger foods so you're gonna give them a nice little taste make them come back for more and I have to do pretty Bacon's gonna hold everything together [Music] you go ahead and finish these up and I'll show you if next step is all right guys I'm gonna floppy bacon we're ready to wrap these bad boys up so let's go ahead and start like this and we're just basically twisting and turning and we just want the bacon to basically sit on there so when it gets nice and crispy it's gonna be delicious so don't worry if it opens back up a little bit that'll happen and these are half slices of bacon so and we just want to hold the seams areas down alright guys so our pickles are out of the oven and they are ready they're a little hot yet but knowing this is the first time I've tried this with the thick-cut bacon and not a huge success all of them look pretty good but if I had to do it again I'd probably just lay up top piece of bacon on top of it rather than trying to wrap it because you know the ones that was wrapped you know even though I precooked it a little bit still not as crispy as I'd like but nevertheless my friends leave these things up especially because I think they're probably jalapenos underneath and so when they bite into a pickle they're gonna go what the hell is that so that's gonna be great but we find a good one here this one looks like it's a mess this one looks like a pretty good one and it's hot so I'm gonna have just good thing am I just gonna pop the whole thing in my mouth and hope for the best hmm Wow yeah that's really good so you get the pickle and get the saltiness with the pickle and you also get saltiness with the bacon um and then the cheese is kind of kind of bring everything together so you get a lot of salt at first but then you're hit with the bacon flavor and then the the pickle kind of like just kind of slides in there yeah the pickle just kind of slides in there but that's really good you guys like pickles and who doesn't like bacon except Daisy you guys really need to get these a shot these are great and I have another one this one looks good all right guys so we got another sucker here ready to try well you already got one in your hand I've already had a couple of she's already eaten a couple so they are delicious what do you like to buy the best the pickle you get that saltiness right I like the crunchy bacon bacon yeah man the cream cheese makes it kind of sweet and then pickle makes it kind of sour it's like boom it's like it explodes in your mouth it I was waiting for Stacey to say something remark something dirty yeah alright so make sure you give these guys a try and I'm gonna go ahead and turn it over to future Greg so he can show you how to do the chicken enchilada dip and the last recipe thanks Grady alright guys so chicken enchilada dip this is really easy super super super awesome and like whenever I use this at a party before I Akito why's that before I use it at his party everyone always had to find out who brought it because it was so so good alright so let me show you I'm gonna made a couple changes for for keto but for the most part it's pretty much the same all right so we're gonna need some we need softened cream cheese I had a little extra from our pickles so I left that in there we have about 8 ounces of sour cream you can also use Mayo which is really good we can need about a pound and a half of shredded chicken I just pressure cooked a couple chicken breasts and blended it wonder works really good with this he's like a rotisserie can you pull all the meat off of it works great we're gonna need about two tablespoons of taco seasoning or a packet which ever you prefer and we're gonna need about two cups of Mexican blend cheese whatever you prefer I think this I got this from Sam's Club its members mark Mexican cheese and a can of green chiles and normally I put jalapenos but some people aren't quite savvy to the hotness so two cans of green chilies in this case I mean what we're gonna do basically is we're just gonna blend this all together in a bowl and then we're gonna put it in a greased cast-iron skillet or you put it in a glass casserole dish or or whatever you want to do so we're gonna go ahead and just basically dump everything together here how you guys like my sour cream positioning here it's pretty good right never seen so much full and a half a cup that that was not a half cup by the way that was more like two cups of sour cream just so you know all right green chilies I don't drain them I just pour them right in when they're opened properly now looks like the person that openings for me work was consistent [Music] I think our cameras gonna be a little shaky right now because the operators are laughing too hard two tablespoons of taco seasoning going in I'm just gonna mix this first you'll need that spoon I'm gonna make sure that cream cheese gets incorporated that's deliciousness that's going in all right when you get about that consistency let's just throw the chicken in feel free to get in there with your hands but this chickens hot so I'm not gonna do that all right once everything is fully incorporated I need some spray spray that we're gonna throw this and a preheated 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes and we're just gonna kind of smooth ER out so this is a 12-inch cast-iron skillet but like I said you don't have to use a cast-iron skillet you're gonna bake it uncovered for like about 30 minutes just to let all the flavors kind of blend then you can serve this to your non keto friends with tortilla chips which is what we use to eat all the time but now we eat it with fathead crackers hmm we eat it with broccoli tots maybe some keto breadsticks would be good low-carb tortillas or you know what it's actually really great if you just eat it within a pool just pretend like there's actually an enchilada there that the shell just got left behind that looks pretty good all right so 350 for 30 minutes let's do this all right guys so our chicken enchilada dip that's coming out the oven as you can see it's browned on the top looks delicious delicious Stacy our prefers to have her cheese on the top she already complained about it as it came out of the oven so we'll go ahead and a pleaser her to put another cup of cheddar cheese right on top like so we'll throw it back in the oven for about five minutes then I'll show you what it looks like after that hey guys welcome back so melted cheese success the macros linked below and will include the extra cup of shredded cheese on the top we'll call it Stacey's alteration or something like that anyway super hot but should come in here so you can serve it right out of this pan which is awesome right I'm just gonna take some spots of the middle you can see how warm cheesy that is and all the chicken in there Stacey's gonna kill me for but let's get a bite or some pepper action now I prefer with a little bit more bite but Stacey consumes most of this so I make it the way she likes it alright nice piece of chicken hot smells delicious creamy you can't go wrong with this guy's let us know if you you give any one of these three recipes to try and I'll see you guys in the next video have a good game day go Rams", "e7DJ8khHcJE": "\u25cf Matcha Madeleine\nUnsalted Butter 60g / Egg

cinnamon rolls that we're gonna have in the morning for breakfast yes they are keto Senate rolls actually got this recipe from Quito Jinja I will link you below to her video of this I don't only like to do videos of something somebody else has already made but I'm trying to get some practice in that doing these videos so I figured since I'm making it and it's a nice day with a light through the window I'm gonna give it a shot so I will come back with a different angle so you can see what the ingredients are and we'll donate I'm gonna start out with that let you know what ingredients we'll be using today I haven't measured anything out yet obviously but I just want to have everything out so we could go over what you're going to need we are not advertising a score today but it just happens to be the best thing that I've been able to use and it doesn't affect your sugar alcohols they have different varieties there's a also like some monk fruit sweeteners you can get that have different varieties as well those are great so for today we're going to need a cup and a half of mozzarella cheese 3/4 of a cup of almond flour and I actually ran out of long flour had to run out and get some I actually bought this one all these like a six bucks so it's actually a little bit cheaper than what I normally spend we will need one egg will also need a half a teaspoon of salt which I don't even actually have on the counter at the moment or a teaspoon of cinnamon so we'll need that as well three tablespoons of the granular swerve is what we're going to need for the dough and we'll get going on that in just a moment alright I just hang it up my mozzarella in my cream cheese so I just got to mix this together basically this is made with feta dough so just want to make sure I get this mixed up really well the cream cheese mixed all through it looks good there and then we're going to mix in my 3/4 of a cup almond flour and we're gonna get this mixed in well of course I'm gonna make a mess trying to do it on the video but that's the way it goes I probably should try to use a bigger bowl stuff is a blast it's so so sticky if you've ever worked with Fathead dough before trust me it is you've never worked with it it is very sticky and if it gets a point where it doesn't want to mix in anymore I will sit back in the microwave to where it's a little bit more wetter consistency and then mix it in a little bit better [Music] I've actually seen where people have put it in the microwave with the almond flour in it like just in the beginning I've never tried it that way it might be better that way but we'll give it a shot this way get that all mixed in me know my cinnamon rolls yes I got imitation vanilla that's what I've got and I will use that until I run out it actually doesn't happen a little bit of sugar in it and you're only using a teaspoon for the whole recipe so you're probably I would assume I don't quote me and it's not enough to do anything to you since it's just a that's lovely hopper there since it's just that tiny bit so make sure this is mixed in really well and then we're gonna but I should have put all my dry ingredients together which is just the sugar in that but kind of winging this you know my videos like I said it's like live live TV we're just gonna do it right now so I'm gonna need a teaspoon tablespoon of vinegar I am not prepared as you can tell so I have C teaspoon of cinnamon which is like the best scent in this freaking planet my flying machine I love that smell my wild neighborhood vehicles again guys honestly I think 90% of times when I buy candles they are usually something related to caramel cinnamon or vanilla so that's usually what we get I'm actually just got some different candles I'll do a house tour ish one day and show you like some of my favorite things it once this starts cooling off a little bit I can put the egg in there I don't like doing it until it gets a little bit cooler so there's arson and then it's actually have teeth not the Miller is actually not until later that is actually going in this building need to put my sperm in here the granular I will need to sorry [Music] [Music] I think since it's a little cooler now I'll go ahead and put my egg in here that way I'll probably help me a little bit with getting this all mixed in like the cinnamon sugar and all that yummyness mix together so and everybody always tries to warn you of this but please please please please please please make sure you do let that dough cool off before you start adding in hey because if you don't you wind up with sprimp eggs and a bunch of wasted ingredients the ingredients are not cheap and we're gonna call this mixed in together until it forms a dough ball here and then we'll put it in the refrigerator for a little bit while we do the filling where do I need for the filling is four tablespoons of butter that's melted we'll do that at the end we also will need 4 tablespoons of the brown sugar swerve and 1 teaspoon of vanilla 1 teaspoon of cinnamon all right I've got my oven on we're preheating back to 375 I actually greased with some cooking spray I think buy a glass pan which you can use a round cake pan if you like I don't have the round cake pan because I don't make round cakes normally I just make you know square ones or not by 13 so I've got that greased the oven is preheating to 375 and while the dough is in their fridge for a little bit we're gonna make the filling that goes inside the center rows so I have already melted 4 tablespoons of butter and I'm gonna need 4 tablespoons of this brown sugar work we're stuck like real brown sugar I'm telling you he's like molasses and stuff it's crazy and for alright so I've got that together I've had a couple people ask about my what the fork is for dinner sign I actually I do vinyl I may have mentioned that at one point before but I made that thought it was cute okay so I'm gonna actually put my vanilla and I'll sit him in here first insist stuffs pre thick and so we need one teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla [Music] so I'm just gonna pour this over my brown sugar this is actually going to be the first time I will be using the swerve brown sugar and the swerve confectioner's so just give that a good mix until it's all mixed in well obviously the brown sugars not really gonna like dissolve it's kind of you know melting a little bit into this something there no it was it'd be just a chunk of butter but it was big white color or something so I've got it all mixed in well it's kind of liquidy but that's ready to go for the filling and I am actually gonna pull out my dough from the refrigerator and we'll get that laid out and see what our next step is got our dough out of the refrigerator I've got two pieces of parchment paper I'm not gonna worry about putting it on a cookie sheet or anything just yet but we're gonna put the cookie dough on the parchment paper here and now if you hear a noise we do live near a train track so you know how it is anything that's going to make some noise and you're trying to do something like this it's gonna happen so what I'm going to do is put another piece of parchment paper on top and press this down and then we're gonna roll it out obviously it would help if I had it might be why some people use a pan to do this with so that doesn't move like that it's okay obviously I'm not going for the pretty ones because it's kind of hard to get this stuff to do what you wanted to do sometimes trying to get it as square as possible so that we can roll it up for the most part evenly obviously it's not doing what I wanted to do but we're working with it so my parchment paper I get the pre-cut ones doesn't look too bad to me it's not even obviously all over the place back there that's good that works we've got this puppet is good to go so let's just see if I can get some more and I know this stuff is a pain in the booty I'm actually gonna grab another piece of the parchment paper sorry I'll record do that not working out the way I wanted to right now so I'm just trying to get it somewhat of an even piece here I believe you're not it's not as sticky as your normal fat hand oh I think it's because with all the other ingredients in the crook and I would totally be using this the correct way if it wasn't slightly rounder table but it's close enough I'll make sure the edges are pretty even usually you want to try to get everything the same sickness sickness Wow okay wrong channel so obviously this is the first time I've made this so it's not gonna be perfect Plus trust me ugly food normally tastes better guys I know you've probably done that before but we're gonna spread our filling out and then we're going to use the parchment paper to help roll them up into a pinwheel too there [Music] look at my filling I guess it's safe to say I need to remelt my butter that's great that's something you don't see them show yet you gotta put that one right off okay I'm gonna heat that back up [Music] oh gosh so sorry there okay I don't have a basting brush and this stuff is really liquidy now that I read he did it see disaster in progress please stand by all right we're gonna give this a second to actually get a little bit thicker because that's just too watery since I had to read it but hey at least you guys know what can't happen we'll let that sit for a minute and then we'll come back okay I have let this thicken up more that's much better this is not as watery as it was and just kept stirring it for a minute really literally not even maybe a minute so I'm going to pour this out on then here it may be a mistake but you're watching me do it so if nothing else will let it get a little thicker before we spread it out so at some point I would like to get a rubber basting brush and probably will soon my husband actually works at a store or they sell a lot of home goods and stuff like that so then I get the discount gotta love the discount so how about all stuff for the house there that I can it's not spreading too bad I think it would probably do a little bit better if I had a facing brush I kind I don't really want to go all the way out to the edge but I guess we probably should somewhat if you hear any music in the background which I don't know if you can turn off and I'm will we leave our cable on like music channels when we're doing stuff around the house it's we don't have a stereo setup or anything like that so it helps me and my perfectionism is trying to like make it perfect and that ain't gonna happen alright this is where we want to sing a little prayer and say please cook in God's let us roll up this thing the way it needs to be rolled so we're going to just barely start pushing it over like that and it may end up being black role but it's rolling so obviously like we said before it's probably not gonna be free but we're making it work trying to let you guys see it as I do it obviously like I said some of these edges we're not gonna be perfect see that there Oh making a mess negative mess disaster disaster wrap okay keep going girls keep going we're almost there it's not gonna be pretty but I bet you it's gonna be delicious seven rolls are like one of those things that I don't know don't do that things we don't realize how much you miss it so it's gone and that worked out good I put it right on that one piece look look so now we're going to actually put this in the fridge for I think it's just a few minutes 20 minutes 10 minutes yeah we're gonna refrigerate this for about 10 minutes and then come back to it and we're gonna slice it up so we'll be back to finish that step I hate what I did was actually I stuck it in the freezer since my ovens been preheated for a little bit now I should have probably waited a little bit to preheat it I don't have a sifter coz I don't use this stuff much either so for the icing what we're gonna do is which you can wait if you want to make the icing you can wait to make this after they're done cooking and put them all in there hot but I'm just going to go ahead and make it now so you can see how it works I have two tablespoons of softened butter not melted butter we've made this mistake before and one teaspoon of the powder swerve I'm so sorry that is incorrect it's 3/4 of a cup of powdered work I thought that wasn't right and the teaspoon is actually gonna be the vanilla hello teaspoon of vanilla and then I need a teaspoon of milk or half and half my husband actually uses milk for his coffee and it's just a smidge so no stressing on that if you have to use milk nootropic managed to put you know how numbers okay and then I'm going to use it's 3/4 of a cup of the powdered swerve I'm sorry about that guys I didn't mean to do that so there's one or two and three - a tablespoon teaspoon since we mix that in there by accident jump system Lee continues to check the directions so we're gonna mix this together yeah I'm using my Mandarin spare no you're gonna I get it you're that mess we are slinging it and I don't know how you call this icing that's some big stuff I think they actually had to add more when I was watching other people make it so we're gonna do like another little teaspoon or so of that and I would almost think that it was probably better if you actually had your butter melted and not softened I think if that was melted it might work a little bit better this pan is not doing it for me [Music] I mean if you want to stick a sink you can make it a thick icing I'm the kind of girl I kind of want it to melt a little bit so we're gonna wait and when these come out warm I'm gonna put it on it and see if it does the little melting thing and like you know the typical cinnamon bun ice and stuff does that you get in the fridge rated section because it's probably about that thick honestly so that extra teaspoon of milk Emily that helped a lot we're gonna go from there and see what it does once we actually put it on the hot buns hot buns baby so we're gonna put on the put oil in the pan now and we'll go from there all right so there's the log my log and I'm gonna use one of the best knives that we have I like to try to get these a little more round into here we got here obviously they're not gonna be even [Music] I'm some we're gonna get about ten use a good knife I think I'm getting thicker further I go down oh not too bad they're not too bad they're about as even and they're gonna get so what we're gonna do is that doesn't look too bad for the crappiest one and then the next to the crappiest one okay so that's what we have which doesn't look that bad we'll see and I know they say to put this in a pan around pan but that didn't work out for me I don't have one so we're gonna give this a shot I know it may end up being distorted once they swell out some I got this short one here that may cook out sooner the rest of them and they're not a hundred percent even but you know what that's life nothing's gonna be perfect guys so we're gonna put this in the oven for we're gonna start out with 40 minutes and check in depending on everybody's oven they can take as long as 30 minutes so check on my 20 check them again at 25 or however often you want to check them but at the most it should not take more than 30 minutes unless I have cut these too thick so we're gonna see and go from there [Music] [Music] [Music]", "wYVBNGhIs-Y": "consumer Ethernet has pretty much followed the rule of each generation having ten times the maximum speed of the previous one however the game is changing there are actually some quarter and half measures in the works yes my friends that's right you're gonna be seeing two point five gigabit and five gigabit ethernet devices popping up all over the place but why to answer we spoke to Ben hacker and Ben Benson over at Intel and we'd like to thank them for their contributions to this episode as internet speeds get faster it's becoming clear that we're gonna need something that is faster than the gigabit ethernet that's supported by lots of our home modems and routers even if you don't have fibre to the home new versions of the DOCSIS cable internet standard can support speeds beyond one gigabit per second in fact two gigabit connections are becoming common in tech mecca's like south korea and japan which is all fine and good but why bother with this tweener stuff when you can go out and buy a 10 gigabit network card and ten gigabit switch today well the issue is that the 10 gigabit standard doesn't work very well over most of the existing Ethernet cabling that's out there so if you go out and buy a theoretical cable modem with a 10 gig port on the back of it chances are that you're gonna end up needing to change out every network cable in your house in order to get the full benefit of it and in commercial installations this problem is much worse you see many buildings have been pre-wired with ethernet jacks in the walls that used the older cat 5e cable standard which was designed to handle up to 1 gigabit per second over a distance of 100 meters and for a long time that was just fine but 10 Gigabit Ethernet requires a newer cable called cat 6 to go 50 meters and an even higher end cable called cat 6a with the a4 augmented to do the full hundred meters the reason that CAF IV can't carry a 10 gigabit signal effectively over those distances is that it doesn't have as much protection against interference and crosstalk so what this means is that getting 10 gigabit to work in many places would mean ripping the old cables out of the wall and putting in new ones and that is alongside all of the equipment in the networking room and all of the client pcs that is a tough triple whammy to the old corporate pocketbook so the powers that be are instead introducing a two and a half Gigabit Ethernet solution because it turns out that a cat5e cable that was built to spec can actually handle a two and a half gigabit per second signal just fine over a hundred meters and even a five gigabit per second signal will usually work the holdup was just that the industry doesn't like to bother rolling out a new spec for less than ten times the previous speed because they typically view it as not being worth the effort it takes but given how excessive the ten gigabit speed is for general consumers and the fact that ten gigabit equipment is still a lot more expensive the industry has finally developed an interest in being able to sell faster equipment at a price that consumers can actually handle so faster ethernet speeds then are gonna have immediate benefits for enthusiasts and prosumers who want the additional bandwidth for things like transferring files between pcs and network attached storage or running home media servers as for the regular consumer well the benefits today might actually be limited but two and a half or five gigabit ethernet jacks rolling out in computers network adapters and modems over the coming years means that our underlying infrastructure is going to be ready for future advancements like 8k streaming video to multiple

welcome back to our channel for those of you who are just joining us my name is josie and this is my dad peter certified master baker our channel is primarily focused on teaching you how to make the highest quality baked goods and desserts at home weekly today we are going to be showing you guys how to make a couple of different holiday pies one is a sweet potato pie and then a caramel pecan pie i'm going to pass it over to my dad to tell us a little bit more about what we're going to be baking thanks josie hi i'm chef peter and today we're going to be starting out with our pie dough which is a pata fonse and i like this type of dough for those with soft filling or pies with soft fillings because it won't get soggy and it holds up really well with the liquid and it's a fairly simple dough to make we're starting out with flour and salt on our bench we're going to take our butter at room temperature so it's soft and we're going to blend it with an egg we're going to mix it up really well so it's all combined then we're going to use our fingertips we're going to blend that into the flour until it's a nice sandy kind of a texture okay then we're going to add ice water to that just enough so that it forms together into a ball and then we're going to chill it down and you need to chill that for at least two hours uh or otherwise it won't hold up real well when you bake it so then we're going to roll it out put it in our pie shell uh you know make it look nice we're going to blind bake it which means we're going to fill it with pie weights and bake it for about 10 to 15 minutes just so it bakes very lightly through the center of the dough and then once it's cool it'll be ready for our filling all right let's go ahead and get started let's do it all right so we are getting started with making our pie dough we have our flour and our salt and we've just made a little well and we're adding our butter and our egg directly into the middle of our well and we're just mixing that until we get that grainy texture [Music] [Music] um and then we're just gonna add little bits of ice water at a time until we get a dough that holds together and then you're gonna knead it briefly so everything combines and then you're gonna wrap it in plastic and you're gonna refrigerate it for at least two hours um before we do anything to it it needs to to chill for a little bit first [Music] [Music] [Music] the fridge and we are just getting ready to put it in our pie shell so we're kneading it out we have some flour on our workspace here and then we're rolling it out until it's about an eighth of an inch thick then we're putting our pie pan directly on top of that and we're just cutting the edges leave about an inch and a half or so around so you have enough space to form your crust [Music] now we're just gonna blind bake them um so what that means is we're putting a piece of parchment paper in and we're just gonna put um some pie weights in this case we're using rice and beans um and we've used the same thing over and over the same batch of rice and beans for our pie shells and we're just gonna stick it in the oven for five to ten minutes with that pie weight in there until it gets a nice golden brown so it can hold its shape all right so we are going to go ahead and start with getting our fillings made we just took our uh pie shells out and from being blind baked for about 15 minutes um you want to tell us a little bit about the two different fillings that we're going to do yeah so we're going to start with the sweet potato uh sweet potato is pretty simple we're just using sweet potatoes that have been peeled and steamed until they're nice and soft and we're gonna use about two cups worth you know kind of pressed into your measure we're gonna blend that up we're going to add some softened butter to it granulated sugar we've got several spices cinnamon nutmeg and allspice a little bit of lemon juice and that's all going to get just mixed up really well nice and even we're going to put that under our our pre-baked pie shells partially baked pie shells and we're going to go ahead and uh finish baking those until they're just sat in the middle they might be just a tiny bit jiggly when they're done but they should be and they'll set up nice when they're cool nice and then um what about the caramel pecan pie yeah so the pecan pie is a fun kind of a classic um again it's pretty simple everything's pretty much just mixed up together we notch it up a little bit on this recipe by making our own caramel instead of using the corn syrup which people often use you can use corn syrup if you don't want to if you don't want to go the extra work to do this but the caramel adds a really nice little kick to it um so we're going to show the process for doing that it's pretty simple but it takes about 40 minutes to get that ready and a little bit of time to cool all right let's go ahead and get started great now we're getting started on our sweet potato pie filling so here we have our sweet potato and we are just using our hand mixer to mash it up until it's really soft then we're adding our butter and our sugar and our eggs and our spices a little bit of lemon juice and we're blending that all together until it's really nice and smooth [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're getting started on our caramel bourbon pecan pie we're making our caramel syrup here first takes about 45 minutes to do um just some sugar and some water and a slice of lemon a little bit of lemon juice and you're going to cook it on low for about 45 minutes until it gets to be a light amber color and if it's too thick you can add more water and cook it down a little bit and that works just fine as well [Music] [Music] all right so once you have your caramel syrup you're going to take your brown sugar your syrup your salt your eggs your melted butter your whiskey and your vanilla you're going to take everything except your pecans and you're going to thoroughly blend it all together [Music] [Music] and what you're going to do is you're going to take your pecans about a half a cup and a half and you're going to put those into the bottom of the pre-baked crust um so you're just going to layer the bottom with your pecans and then you're going to pour your filling on top and you're going to bake at 25 all right we are back with our completed pies right here we have our beautiful sweet potato pie and then over here we have our pecan pie or caramel pecan pie and we're just going to go ahead and we're going to bite into these and do a little taste test on camera got a slice of each who's going to try come on liam we brought my little brother to make sure everything is all kit approved which one you want to try first that one's good like really good nice wow so both really tasty did you even get a burrito nope well i guess it's a good sign when it when it disappears from the plate all right we will see you guys next

Today, we will be featuring how to make an extremely quick and easy baked herb salmon. The total time for preparing this meal is under 30 minutes. The macronutrient ratio for this recipe is 3.1 to 1, and has 1.5 g carbs per 115 gram or 4 ounce serving. This recipe was shared by a neighbor, who received it from a relative, a poissoniere chef working at a popular Mediterranean restaurant. Step 1: as with all recipes, begin by assembling and measuring these few needed ingredients. Also, line your baking tray with parchment and pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius or 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Now for step 2: in a measuring cup or small bowl combine the grated garlic, the pepper, the coriander, salt, chopped cilantro, or, if you don't like cilantro, substitute with flat-leaf Italian parsley. Add the olive oil, or either avocado or grapeseed oil if you prefer. After stirring the ingredients, set aside for 15 to 30 minutes to allow ingredients to infuse and flavor the oil. Step 3: Place the salmon fillet onto your cutting board and pat it dry. It is important to dry both the top and the bottom of the salmon, because, if you do not, your ingredients will not stick well to the surface of the fish. I would like to mention that you do not need to use a full fillet. You can use this prep method for one or two serving portions. Just make less marinade. After your marinade has had time to flavor, stir again. Place the salmon fillet onto the parchment lined baking tray. With a basting brush, generously coat both the top of the salmon and also coat the skin side of the salmon. When both sides are coated, place skin side down onto the baking tray. While you are brushing on the marinade, be sure to evenly distribute the garlic and other ingredients, over the entire surface, in order that each mouthful will have the same delicious flavor. If you have any unused marinade, pour it on top. If you have time, or you can do this earlier in the day, cover the tray with cling wrap and refrigerate to allow the coated salmon to rest and absorb the flavors of the marinade for several hours. Although this gives you maximum flavor, it is not necessary as the marinade is very flavorful already. You can bake immediately. Step 4: To bake, place the tray in the preheated oven in the middle rack position and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, but I would suggest you test after 10 minutes. Test the fish because your fillet may need less or more time than I have recommended. Test by inserting a fork. If the meat flakes, but still looks moist inside, it is done. Remove from the oven and place on a serving plate to rest for a few minutes. In this way, the juices are reabsorbed into the flesh. To plate, place the salmon portions, either whole or cut into serving sizes, and garnish with lemon wedges and fresh cilantro or flat leaf parsley. For a complete meal, serve with your choice of side vegetables, such as a simple salad, cauli rice or roasted broccoli with parmesan and lemon. If you make extra, or have leftovers, the baked salmon is a great prep ahead meal, as a salad bowl for lunch, or dinner the next day. Enjoy! See you next time and thank you for watching.", "jP0cFtE9v5k": "hi my name is Alex with helix ports comm and in this video I'm going to teach you how to make a great anti-inflammatory recovery smoothie I workout on an empty stomach and then I need to restore Mike like Asian levels so I go for a fruit dense plant-based smoothie that is great for workout recovery and has some anti-inflammatory properties as well which helps with the muscle recovery to restore the glycogen levels we're gonna go for a 2 to 3 spotty bananas I go for the spotty bananas because they've got more sugars in them they're easier to digest and the antioxidants are more readily available I know a lot of people like green bananas but those are actually super starchy and it's way harder on your digestive system so I would go for the spotty bananas bananas are great they've got lots of potassium in them which helps with cramping and it's a great sugar source so that's why I choose bananas next we're gonna add blueberries blueberries have lots of antioxidants mood boosting brain boosting and arterial function boosting properties we're gonna add about 3/4 cup to a full cup of blueberries I wish I was making this movie in high school because it keeps me full for about 3 to 4 hours after I drink it in high school I used to just wake up have a bowl of cereal and like an hour or two later into school I would be starving already but with this I can last for about 3 to 4 hours before I get hungry again and want to eat so for the kale we're gonna do 2 large handfuls of the kale and out of this bag I can get like 4 or 5 servings out of that so I'm just going to dump the rest in because that's about what I would use next we're gonna add ground flax seed flax seed is great for omega-3 fatty acids there's lots of good minerals in flaxseed but you have to get the ground flaxseed unless you have a blender that's gonna break them up because it's really hard for your body to absorb it from whole flax seeds same for chia seeds and hemp seeds so if you're gonna use any of those I would say buy ground otherwise you should have a really high powered blender that can break it up for you so I just I'm just gonna eyeball it because I don't really ever measure this so it's really about two tablespoons okay next thing I'm going to add is peanut butter powder you can use regular peanut butter if you like I just don't like to have oil in the food that I eat ppph it is also it has less calories so if you're going to use peanut butter outside of this PDF it is a good way to go but really for me this is just a supplement for protein protein it will keep you feeling full longer and it's got some amino acids which which helps with muscle recovery and it's also got a little bit of flavor so it adds a little bit of dimension to the smoothie and again I'm just gonna eyeball this I don't ever actually met her my stuff and some people say tumeric I like to say turmeric the main active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin curcumin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and in our body we have inflammation to help repair cells and it fights off pathogens but we don't want our body to always be in a state of inflammation so we can have anti-inflammatory foods to help bring us back out of that into a more neutral State unfortunately the curcumin isn't absorbed into the bloodstream very well so we actually need to add some black pepper but first I'm just gonna pour some of this guy in here not too much all right and then like I said we have to add black pepper black pepper contains Piper in and Piper in is going to help the absorption of the curcumin it actually helps it absorb it by 2,000 percent so again we're just gonna add a little bit I don't really measure it but it's about half a teaspoon [Music] okay now we need to add liquid some people use water some people would want to use milk since I'm vegan I use a plant-based milk I actually really like the way cashew milk tastes I used to use soy milk for a long time and then I tried cashew milk is far superior soy milk Estes weird taste to it a cashew milk I think is much better I like the nuttier taste and we're just gonna add about a cup swerve just to make sure that we can get everything flowing and then if we need to we can always add more milk at the end but you can never take the milk out so I would start with less milk or less liquid and then add more as you go to get the consistency where you want it lastly I'll just talk about these supplements real quick we've got a polyphenol blend which is a ground-up powder of different berries and vegetables and I use this about once or twice a week or if I don't have the blueberries on hand there's lots of vitamins and minerals in here so I'll use that and I've got creatine which I'll use again about once or twice a week but just because I don't think you need to have creatine every day creatine helps keep your muscles full and helps with muscle recovery so that's the smoothie that's what I want to show you now we need to blend this up and we're going to just work our way into a slow blend - a fast blend and then we're gonna add more milk if we need to all right looks pretty good looks a little bit runny er than I like it so we can add in some extra flax seed added another banana or even some peanut butter powder to get it a little bit thicker to where I would like it so again just be mindful go slow with the milk you can slow with the liquid because you can always add more but you can never take it out so let me pour this and this is what I will have in the morning after a workout and keeps me going for a few hours and if you guys have any questions you can put them in the comments let me know what you think if you make it Cheers", "mvgVfZHT5Rc": "Hello everyone I am Maomao, Soft Europe Bread become especially popular in recent years  It has less oil and sugar with a chewy taste Today I will share with you a basic soft European bread spinach cheese flavor   It uses the method of Poolish wet sponge Dough Very soft the sponges used for baking bread include many different methods Today we will take a look at some common bread preferments Bread making is generally divided into direct method and indirect method The direct method is to stir all the ingredients directly at once and then ferment in other words You can start the process when you get the materials Its production time is short but Relatively easy to age the way to add the softness is to add Tangzhong which is use hot water to flour heat the mixture method to increase the moisture content of the dough Indirect method Before making the main dough Use part of the flour and water in the recipe A small amount of yeast mixed together first And then Then mixed with the remaining ingredients to form the main dough Generally, there are three types: Biga, Poolish, and p\u00e2te ferment\u00e9e (fermented dough) In fact, they have similar concepts Just various on its thickness which is different In the Biga method, 30% to 50% of the flour in the recipe is first mixed with Part of water yeast to form a dough Then ferment at room temperature for a while to activate the yeast Then, put it in the refrigerator Very suitable for office workers to control the mixing and baking timing Poolish dough uses less than 40% of the flour in the frecipe and adds the same weight of water With 1% just a little bit of yeast to firm a pretty wet dough Fermented at room temperature to be three or four times larger and there are some bubbles on the surface Then, put it in the refrigerator and continue to ferment until there are honeycombs When the surface is full of bubbles, there is the kind of fermented wine smell This dough has very high water content So it is especially suitable for making soft European bread with less oil and sugar It was invented in Poland So it was called Poolish sponge dough p\u00e2te ferment\u00e9e (fermented dough) is actually the baguette freanch toast dough we usually eat and leaves a piece of dough for using next time Why it is called French old sponge Is from Taiwan Taiwanese like to call baguette French bread as French bread So they will call it French Dough You will be more familiar with them as you bake more Let\u2019s first look at how to make Poolish preferment It needs to be made one day in advance and put in the refrigerator for use the next day First we put the yeast in the flour This yeast is only 1% content  very little Then combine it with flour Add the equal weight of water Use room temperature water Because the dough is very wet So we don\u2019t use hand but chopsticks or hand whisk to mix till no dry powder is left. I made two times of the amounts listed in the recipe here So I used 400 grams of flour According to the recipe, two Poolish sponge dough should use 300 grams of flour But like these scrapers, hand whisks There will be some residues stuck on them So when you do If you make 150 grams of flour according to the recipe I suggest you make 200 grams of flour In case in the end you don\u2019t have enough preferment dough for the main dough We cover with plastic wrap Write down the time start a timer in case you forget  The room temperature in our house is 23 degrees Celsius(72F) I let it rised for two and a half hours Don\u2019t take time as the criteria but the state of the dough Rise till the dough volume increased three times larger Bubbles start to appear on the surface then it can be used in the refrigerator the next day We look at this little About 0.5 gram to 1 gram of yeast when it rising the dough You feel it can rising the whole world So baking bread is a very fun thing to do I'm still learning recently How to grow my own natural yeast for bread making Look like this There seems to be few bubbles on the surface, then you can put it in the fridge In fact, at this time, it has already begun to have few honeycombs inside. But it doesn\u2019t mean that the wine aroma comes out completely So we put it in the refrigerator the next day it will be full of bubbles This This is the brand of bread flour I often use Its protein content is 12.7% Everyone must look at the protein content when buying bread flour the flour need at least 12% of protein for making bread We prepare the ingredients Especially the butter must be taken out in advance to soften it We prepare a pot of hot water softten this spinach first If you are not buying this kind of spinach leaves If you have a stem, you must remove the root part boil little then put it on the sieve net for draining Drain it Then use the drained 100 grams of spinach and  100 grams of water  Notice here , the spinach weight 100g is the weight after boil and drain 100 grams of dried spinach and 100 grams of water to make a juice why i write 100 grams of spinach in my recipe is to cover the cases that  If the amount is small, it will not be easy to blend and you may lost some when you pour So why not just do a little more you are good as long as you have enough 125 grams of juice to put in the dough We take the Poolish preferment from the refrigerator Let\u2019s see if the surface is full of bubbles This state is called full of bubbles Let\u2019s compare yesterday\u2019s with today\u2019s after another 12 hours in the refrigerator See the honeycomb inside Do you feel that you can smell the scent of that even through the screen Then it started to have some gluten formed If you grab it with your hands You can see that it is in the shape of a hornet's nest Then the dough Has begun to be sticky So its water content is particularly large Can make the bread very soft Can stay very soft for a few days Next we will start making the main dough We take the mixer pot out Weigh in 300 grams of the Poolish preferment This recipe need 500 grams of flour So we add the remaining 350 grams of high-gluten flour Put the caster sugar aside Put the yeast on the other side Then add salt and yeast Don't put it together and add spinach juice This spinach juice should at least add about 100 grams Then we start at low speed Mix all the ingredients evenly When mixed into a group Remember to take a spatula Dial in the dry powder around Help the machine Don't rely solely on the machine Especially when it first started when you can't see dry powder anymore We check it by pinching it with two fingers Look at the state of the dough At this time, you can see that it is relatively dry But not necessarily to add water yet We need to increase the speed After hitting it into a ball This state is the state you use to decide whether to add water Let's take a look at this dough It seems like it is little bit dry So I added about ten grams of spinach juice Don\u2019t underestimate these ten grams of spinach juice It can instantly make your dough softer I kneaded about nine minutes (including the previous low-speed mixing time) Let's take a look at the status I usually like to cut a piece with scissors And then turn it 90 degrees turn it again to see the state of the membrane The film at this time is relatively thick Not that thin Then if you poke a hole with your finger Jagged around Not particularly smooth But the dough is already very gluten We call it the state of eight percent of gluten formed Now add the softened butter Butter must be softened If it is too late to soften Can be microwaved for five seconds Five seconds to check the status Let it soften After adding butter We must beat at low speed Knead the butter into the dough Don't knead too fast at this time Because at the high speed Butter is slippery Where it will slip, it will not kneaded Where it\u2019s not slippery, it will be kneaded more In this case, the whole texture of the dough will be uneven Then after the butter is absorbed We will transfer to medium and high speed to continue kneading Generally speaking, three minutes after adding butter is disolved we have to check the status every minute Don't over beat it now the butter is disolved into the dough After that,incread the kneading speed on medium and high speed for four minutes Look at the current membrane is obviously thinner than before Then if you poke a hole with your finger Its edges are relatively smooth the whole dough is full of strong gluten structure when you pull the dough with both hands if you pull the dough it Just collapsed No gluten at all That means you have over beated the dough Although the film is very thin But you have already over kneaded This state is worse than not reaching the right gluten structure so You'd rather not reach the exact gluten structure  than to over beat this dough We take it out Use your hands to form a ball like this Ferment it in a bowl Make a shot Let's measure the temperature it is about 25 degrees (77F) It is best to keep it below 28 degrees(82F) We cover with plastic wrap You can put it at room temperature Just ferment it like this I like to put it in the oven About 28 degrees for an hour rise till twice the size Poke the hole with your finger without retracting Poke hole with this finger This way It\u2019s not really easy to master Mainly depends on the volume We put it on this chopping board Sprinkle a little bit of dry powder  then press little to release the air Just let it out a little bit Then split Divide into six About 150 grams About 140 grams of dough You just weigh the total weight and divide it by six. When dividing the dough, be sure to use a scraper to cut Don't pull it with your hands Try not to have small pieces division of large blocks is preferred Then we take a piece of dough Fold in two or three times Roll it into a circle So the general sequences for making bread is to making the dough rise the first time Split Rounding  relaxation Shaping , second rise and then baking After rounding We want to relax it Relax for about 20 to 30 minutes When the dough is at rest Let's prepare the filling This is the bacon is panfried in advance Chop it up And this is cheddar cheese  cheddar cheese I think it\u2019s more fragrant than mozzarella and bacon in bread If you don't like it Can also be replaced with mozzarella cheese Just cut into small dices after the resting time is over We take it out Exhaust that air slightly by hand Use a rolling pin to roll up and down from the middle to both ends At this time you will find When i roll down It retracted again It shows that it is not rested enough time yet But this time You can continue to rest the dough You can also follow the gluten like in the video It\u2019s okay to roll it up and down slowly and slowly But you must not use brute force to roll it so hard Will destroy the gluten After rolling like this We turn it over Put Squeeze the bottom edge a little underneath Then put on bacon and cheese Just roll it up with your hands This is a very simple look You can also make other shapes But as for the soft Europe bread Generally the shape is relatively simple the size is relatively large This is a feature of the soft Europe bread While making I want to tell you about the soft Europe bread Many people think soft Europe bags are European bread In fact, the soft European bag was invented by Asians Ruanou Bao are not particularly like Europe Bread which is generally oil-free and sugar-free But what about the soft bag It will have a little sugar Will be a little oily It\u2019s a lot less oil and sugar than sweet buns But the soft Europe is actually not low in calories It often adds stuffing in it Especially a lot of cheese filling Although the soft European bag is not really low in calories But it tastes very delicious Then we sprayed water on the surface to glue it with this Parmesan cheese This is also to give it a better appearance If you don't decorate like this No problem at all You can also sprinkle some nuts or something whichever way you like it The shaping of bread is actually like making a cake decoration Usually you can collect some of your favorite bread shaping methods Use the same dough You can make bread in different shapes here want to share with you  How to do a second rise at home without a fermentation oven You can set your oven to the lowest temperature Like mine is 100 degrees You can use 100 degrees heat about 30 seconds to a minute or so Then put a bowl of hot water at the bottom to increase humidity The best second rise condition is 35 degrees 75 % humidity And fermented to about twice the volume But still based on the volume then we start slashing or docking the bread notice here Be sure to cut a bit deeper with a sharp blade This way it will look better in the end Let me emphasize again For the second rise, you must look at the volume Don't look at the status Or a lot of people say it\u2019s a rebound with a hand jab or something Actually that is very vague The judging standard is still based on the volume You think that the bread is about twice as big It's almost big and almost enough Generally the second rise is around 35 degrees It's almost enough size after 50 minutes After scoring the bread, we will bake in the oven becasue the surface is covered with Pamasen cheese So the surface of this bread is golden after baking It\u2019s especially easy to judge when it is ready to take out of oven I used 180 degrees Baked for about 20 minutes In this way, our soft Europe bread is ready. One of the biggest features of the soft European bread is the texture of chewy taste. Especially this kind of crispy outside Soft and warm inside European bag  I thinkwe can only taste this delicacy by baking it at home You might as well try it the same This Polish kind also made a coffee Nuts soft European also tastes very good And the calorie without stuffing is also lower please watch my next video That is all i want to share with you today If you like my video Then leave me a comment subscription Like and share with others I will continue to share with you all kinds of different food I am Maomao See you in the next food video Bye bye", "xw23QboS7LI": "all right so thank you everyone for joining us this morning this is our second session of our week five of our couch socialization series we started these series I wasn't intent to provide a platform for coaches to connect to continue to learn from one another and continue to learn from professionals on a variety of topics so every Wednesday we were hoping to have some sort of like workout theme so this morning we have Craig a strength and conditioning coach from Canaan Sports Center Atlantic with us and he's going to be talking to us about recovery strategies and considerations which is an essential part of working out and definitely a habit that you u.s. coaches can start challenging and for your your athletes during this time and so Craig you can take it away from here I'll meet myself and he'll share his screen to present the presentation hi everyone hopefully we can all see the first slide there so yeah my name is Craig I've been at the Sports Center leg for a few years now prior to that I was NBC working at the spoor Institute's there I wanted to talk today about recovery strategy considerations with a special emphasis on sleep we do spend about a third of our life in bed and there are some other major vs. recovery components as well like nutrition and you know the mental recovery side of things but I often refer to our nutritionists in our mental performance insulins for her deeper dives into those topics so I wanted to start off with just a couple graphical representations before moving into sharing that's more practical information that can lead to help athletes that we work with so when we simplify things down to just training and time there are some dose dependent responses we can anticipate so this this - gray line would kind of represent an athlete's baseline fitness so if we hit them with a certain training load or a workout or week of training for example we can expect that during our special yeah at that time for their fitness to kind of descend a bit but then their recovery process takes place and we can expect their fitness level to jump back up so a few different possible expected outcomes that could occur so if we hit them with a stimulus that isn't a sufficient overload and the recovery is too high then we can expect that they'll return to a very similar baseline fitting this level alternatively if we hit them with a really heavy training load or insufficient recovery and we can expect that the recovery will not be sufficient enough to to arrive back at a equal or higher baseline fitness level and over time that can lead to things like overreaching and perhaps even overtraining alternately turn of Li and what we often strive for with athletes we work with is to let them with progressive increases in training load and sufficient recovery so that their baseline fitness and a certain parameter could be strength for example increases above at initial level gradually over time and then we can get to closer to competition where we try to peak these things however recovery isn't simply just a matter of time reliance we have to ensure the time spent in recovery you know whether this recovery is between sessions or days or something like a plan D load week is being used efficiently so this will be the focus of the presentation moving forward is you know how could we impact the recovery practices of our athletes so that what we plan is is what we get so one more graph and then like I said I'll keep it very practical but I think this chart displaying an interaction between training loads and wellness kind of relates to all weeks discussing so with a couple groups i've monitor athlete's wellness and training loads and i'm not gonna go into too much data detail around the data and the stats behind this work but i do want to provide a brief overview again because it relates to the interaction between training loads and athlete's wellness metrics so in this example athletes and training group I work with receive a daily text where they respond to wellness questions on a 1 to 5 scale so one would be bad or problematic and a 5 would be good or fine so we look at desire to train stress irritability soreness fatigue sleep quality and sleep hours and then each day we have a total wellness score these are dead scores but they just basically look at their overall wellness score and compared to how it usually is so if it's above zero then that means our wellness on that day is a bit better than it typically is and vice-versa if it's negative their wellness is off and a poor trend so we look at daily scores we look at three-day averages and seven-day averages just to see how the athletes are responding so this bottom chart here also shows these daily Wellness ed scores so each date we have this ED score a below zero here we're seeing and then a lot of above zero or positive wellness scores here the athletes also log training durations and ten cities on a one to ten scale so if they have a 60 minute session for example and they rate that intensity at a 5 out of 10 and to calculate training load for that day will multiply the 60 minutes by the intensity of 5 so the training load and arbitrary units would be 60 multiplied by 5 which would be five hundred six months by five three hundred so this this grey line here gives us an idea of where the athletes training loads are and research has shown that I should backtrack for a second here so these training load lines are ratio lines of what the athlete has done over the past week compared to the past month so if they had a really hard that's the week compared to what they were used to over the past month then we expect the train loads be quite high and research has shown that witness ratio of 7 to 28 days training load gets you know at 1.5 and higher and the athletes are an increased risk of things like injury illness in overtraining it should be noted though that sometimes we plan these you know overreaching periods it's a natural part of the training process followed by periods of recovery where we plan to reduce the train loads so that we can again get that recovery to see the applications we're looking for after the recovery now a during believes that increased training loads we do expect the small to moderate dips and wellness as they've been shown in research to be responsive to training loads so things like sleep and mood I've shown have been to be affected negatively by spikes and train loads and again it's a normal part of the training process see in moderate to small wellness changes I will say that with this athlete for example though these are these are dramatically negative wellness scores one of these is uh a negative to Zed score and statistically a negative to Zed score only happens I think it's one sort of every you know a hundred days so that's a pretty poor wellness chorus I'd be inclined to give the athletes the day off for example even though our focus is building up for train loads during this time so and some are you know expect we expect these small to moderate dips and wellness when we're increasing train loads dramatically if we see dramatic changes then we will look at adjusting training schedules so over the past few years though a few things have stood out to me oftentimes athletes will show these dips and wellness without associated training load increases so this relates to me the life complexities of our young athletes they don't they're not full-time athletes it's not just a simple process of sport training and recovery they have heavy physical cognitive and social demands again you know they're not full-time athletes so we can't expect that our planned training schedules will always have the impact we have in mind so due to these demands the recovery habits of our athletes are are so essential they need to be in a state where they're prepared for these training demands that we have planned and the ability to recover from them many athletes are kind of lacking this from these foundational recovery practices and are unprepared for exposure to you know sufficiently high train loads to prepare themselves for appropriately improved performance so we could argue maybe one reason why the athlete who experienced these increased train loads there maybe there Wallace did so poorly because their wellness practices were not in place to handle these increased training loads so we can arm our athletes with education and you know the practice of healthy recovery habits I think we can expect to see a lot smoother sailing responses to our training programs along with competition performance so in terms of a foundational recovery practices that I think we can all enforce to some extent or educator athletes on I think these are three big ones that really stand out nutritional habits mental health is and like stress or management and sleep hygiene which will be the big focus of later part of this presentation then we also have you know our more intermediate or advanced recovery practices like planning active recovery after you know intense training sessions for example foam rolling you know encouraging the athletes to access therapy when needed and then there's you know the more advanced protocol it's like a you know hot and cold water immersion compression therapies etc but I think the bulk of our athletes really need to focus on these foundational recovery practices and I think these are practices that we can easily impact so nutrition isn't one I'm going to spend much time on again because I'm not a nutritionist and I'm sure at some point our nutritionist will give presentations relating to nutrition but what can we ease aliy impact or educator athletes on I think there's a few things one is nutrition practices around training and competition others food choices you know I've seen athletes arrived at training sessions after school and consumed you know candy the fuel their workouts we're not nutritionists but I think we can generally tell the difference between appropriate and inappropriate food choices planning of daily meals and snacks I think planning it's probably maybe the biggest part of of you know are the nutrition laws that our athletes have you know a lot of them live at home or them are planning home prepared meals and snacks throughout the day most of our athletes should actually be eating every few hours you know full meals every few hours but to some degree they should be eating you know meals or snacks every few hours and again I don't think a lot of our athletes are planning out their days nutrition wise hydration we can using a little simple like urine color guides like a white wine color for example is coming maybe if we suggested urine color there's different charts as well that could be provided to athletes to give them kind of an idea of what your own color should look like and hydration time and so making sure athletes are hydrating you know well before not immediately before training making sure they're hydrating sufficiently during training and then the replace influence loss after training so we have you know basic nutritional guidelines around exercise for example which I posted below again I'm not going to go into much detail and trician wise because I'd rather leave that to the nutritionist with nerve sport Network similarly with mental health and stressor management's we have immense performance consultants through our SportsCenter so I will not go to much death and these topics but again what can be easily impact or educator athletes on I do think we can encourage playing of downtime just again due to the complexities of the lives or athletes so downtime itself can improve recovery reduce psychological stress reduce mental fatigue improve mood and reduce overall load earlier I talked about the training load ratio so looking at what the Train what the athlete has done over the past week compared to the past month physically but I've also considered how something like in acute to chronic low mental low it can be impacting our athletes recovery and performance so if they're at a period of increased stress to exams for example I'm sure that will be impacting you know the athletes recovery and and what we can hit them with and expect them to the death from so these this downtime is especially important prior to sleep which will further get into shortly here I think we can also encourage the information of relaxation techniques to improve mood and kind of balance so there are our autonomic nervous system as you know a lot of you a states who work with they're very up in a sympathetic zone headspace is a it's an app that can be downloaded by blasts and if they provide free guided meditations if you're looking to encourage some mindful practices for your athletes and also just simple deep breathing can promote a similar you know parasympathetic response to kind of shift the focus towards recovery and then life stressor management so again I know our athletes have really busy complex schedules and lives so I think we all need to understand when it may be appropriate refer for support and the encouragement of healthy sleep hygiene so if sleep is off then we can expect that to influence mental health metrics as well okay so now I'd like to get into sleep so sleep is vertical for her physical mental workout variants and I believe to be the single best recovery strategy available to release so someone who is dealt with chronic sleep issues I I can speak to how higher it is even to just you know maintain levels of fitness it's so important to the recovery of athletes and again we spend about a third of their life in bed so I think this is a big area where we can educate our athletes to provide better sleep hygiene practices there are a few things sport wise that can impact sleep so if we look at training and competition times studies have shown that evening exercise you know between 7 and 10 p.m. induced sleep phase delays where as morning or earlier afternoon exercise was bound to induce advances in sleep phases so higher intensity exercise in particular spikes Corozal which can impair the the sleep a lot of us are it's impossible for us to avoid these evening training times and competitions but it's just something to consider then when we look at the morning verse evening chronotype so some of our athletes our morning athletes in Western that some of them are night owls and the most dramatic example of where this could become problematic would be a swimmer exposed to early morning training who has it and evening chrono type so they're used to staying up late but they're required to get up early so I think to the best of our ability we need to respect these chrono types and if possible adjust training schedules or demands so the athletes can actually tolerate the training stresses were imposed moment and simply elevate rating loads themselves can cause disturbances in sleep along with other wellness metrics like we touched on it earlier so sleep issues sleep changes have been associated with overreaching and overtraining for examples so we can minor things like sleep to see to potentially of athletes are in these you know overreach zones so there are some negative effects on sleep deprivation I don't spend too much time on this but if anyone would like a more comprehensive and research article support ellipse please read it I've got some great tables showing examples of decrements from various sleep deprivation studies but with deprivation we can expect an impaired brain function or cognitive performance just so appreciated with obesity and diabetes unhealthy food creams as well and impaired glucose sensitivity which can impair that glycogen repletion any other muscle glycogen available for exercise and it can affect their appetite you know making lead to poor food choices and will hinder protein synthesis as well due to the these interactions and also hormonal e we have the growth hormone that'll be inhibited and cortisol increased scores also increases those pro-inflammatory cytokines which can also hinder our immune function so illness risks are also evident physical performance measures have also been shown to the affected so sleep education and hygiene practices can have a big impact not sleep obviously which we'll get into now so sleep hide and basically refers to the practice behaviors that they're still there salt ate sleep versus the baby airs that interfere asleep studies have shown you know clinically relevant sleep problems in 16 percent of athletes and one study closer to 25 percent of athletes and other studies with the rest of the athletes having no or mild clinical sleep issues a study last year nearly 60% of athletes had either mild or moderate sleep problems athletes with clinically relevant sleep problems are more likely to have poor sleep hygiene practices as well which we could expect and the good thing is though sleep behaviors are modifiable so this information in minds you know addressing issues with those experiencing you know clinically significant deck currents and sleep can impact a quarter of the athletes we work with combine that with educational strategies for those with you know more mild sleep issues and we're impacting the how often or have athletes we work with so looking at some sleep routine practices there's some basic experts experts suggested the practices here firstly oldest guys here so having a consistent bedtime and pre bed routine is T so schedule is is key pretty bed routine wise it could be like some light reading some relaxing music maybe a warm shower or bath to to get to sleep your body needs to reduce its core temperature and a lot of researchers suggest something like a warm bath or shower because once you get out of the warm water exposure your body heat dissipates away from the core towards the periphery or the skin so it can help lower your core body temperature after the bath or shower consistent wait times like I said sleep ends like the weekends for example ideally go to kep - no longer than an hour about their usual wake times the bedroom itself should be dark as possible and cool again and we need our core body temperature to drop what a minimize our time in bed so you know no TV computer or phone use in her bed and really just reserve the bed for sleeping yeah I guess intimacy as well but really focusing on utilizing the bed just for sleep practices you're not doing homework in bed I'm using the phone in bed and similarly not hanging the snooze button because that does impact sleep quality avoiding or limiting that bright and blue light exposure you know a couple hours before bed is a typical recommendation if electronics have to be used in the evening our athletes can install those color adjusted and blue lights reducing softwares if your if their home lights have dimmer switches those can also be great just help reduce that bright light exposure later on the evening I will say that many of our athletes are in a habit of using their phone so it kind of unwinds in the evenings I think gradually over time this was suggested by our mental performance consultants Tina that we can try to kind of gradually shift that habit to something that doesn't involve you know looking at the screen so maybe we shift them to encourage them to use their phone for no podcast of a bit more relaxing nature and not something that's too stimulating some of that flex music maybe an audio book just also upon awakening trying to get some bright or natural light it just relates to the impact of light on your body circadian rhythm there's artificial light lamps which can also be an artificial source of this natural light so I know I have one from Costco about 60 bucks but I'll use it when now you know our sunlight super limited or it's also used a lot of times with travel situations so an athletes wake up just kind of just reset their circadian rhythm a bit so getting that bright light exposure before or sorry immediately upon awakening or shortly upon awakening can help the circadian rhythm a lot of our athletes have trouble falling asleep so ideally when our athletes go into bed when they're sleepy and if they can't sleep within about 20 minutes it can be helpful for them to go to another room to engage in the relaxing activity before returning to bed so that kind of goes back to really trying to minimize time spent in bed awake and maximize time spent in bed sleeping we can also look at implementing meditation or simple deep breathing or other relaxation techniques again there's a lot of apps out there like headspace which helps provide some guided meditation [Music] it's made of you don't is your minds in bed due to schoolwork sport dance we've heard them to kind of shut down a bit so again we could encourage them to leave the room and engage in relaxing activities before returning imagery is something I meant to perform it's consultants recommend to athletes so they may suggest athletes to think of a three-letter word a car for example and then slowly picture every object that they can that starts with each letter of that word some additional considerations around sleep would be avoiding and limiting or limiting caffeine especially after lunch and I think caffeine's especially something to consider with athletes experiencing anxiety issues they're probably better off just cutting the notes over time because it will further perpetuate those anxiety issues and as we know anxiety will affect sleep avoiding alcohol especially right before bed that will impact sleep quality consider a void in high intensity exercise in the evening we discussed how that can impact sleep primarily by the increased cortisol which touch the back so you call will be one thing we forget about often those are mattress so most of them last about 10 years max and they may have allergens and just keeping in mind that recovery is global we shouldn't just be focused on the physical you know we need to make sure we reduce mental fatigue because that because that is important for a good sleep and we need to manage our life stressors now that's something I think we can help our athletes with is planning out their schedules as well I think parents can play a role there too and then again seeking help for stress and anxiety management that's needed if maps are needed and often they're cursed for athletes we should try to keep those to no more than 30 minutes and it should be time to about 12 hours from the middle of our sleep period so if you're a fifth year sleep period is 11 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. the middle of that would be 3 a.m. so around 3 p.m. would be inappropriate naptime sleep related to nutrition an adequate calorie intake during the day may impair sleep so supporting our athletes our maintain sufficient nutrition throughout their days at night avoiding large fatty meals however snack with the higher carbs or a higher glycemic index like ice or certain types of Rice's for example I think jasmine rice is one of the higher glycemic index Rice's and protein the idea there was some tryptophan before bed may help melt oh and then found naturally occurring in foods can also help so there's some examples of some foods that have melatonin naturally in them and avoiding too many liquids in the evening I think this is a big thing that is prevalent in some athletes I think it's a lot more effective for athletes to try to maintain hydration practices during the day instead of kind of loading up on the evening and because as you know they'll they more they may wake up a lot more frequently during the evening with too many liquids if anyone's unfamiliar with melatonin um it's basically just a hormone that regulates sleep that's suppressed by light by bright Sun in the morning and then it increases in production at night with darker light exposure by resulting in sleepiness travel wise is important to our athletes get accustom into to new time zones gradually versus just kind of quick one day changeover so a gradual shift over a period like four days to start adjusting you know sleeping week cycles or into their their destination time zones and they consider those consider use of those in the natural melatonin supplements as well like our cherry juice if they are sharing a room it's great them to discuss bedtime schedules with the athletes there they're ruining the way I'll consider the use of your plugs in my mask so this is a great sleep screening screening questionnaire myself and colleagues read a sport innovation conference in China last year and we had a sleep position who utilizes this flood of athletes but damn that's super basic athletes just go to this website here they fill out a quick questionnaire it takes about five minutes and then immediately after they fill out that questionnaire that will be emailed well be shown the results and will be provided fairly individual recommendations for or what they can do to improve their sleep and there's also links to a podcast on sleep education so this can be very valuable unfortunately they can't directly share with you know the coach for example the results go right to the athletes but I guess with approval the athlete could forward on to the coach but again a very helpful resource for athletes and just to wrap up with a bit more additional and advanced recovery considerations you know there's things like active recovery especially important after our more anaerobic training sessions stealth remove metabolic byproducts foam roll and of that is a way to to reduce muscle tension to and improve range of motion and perhaps or do some information therapy is welling a massage physio chiro osteo we can also consider therapies on the mental side of things too then we have our more advanced recovery considerations like cold water immersion protocols or contrast bath protocols I do have a kind of brief one-page document I put together there that outlines a lot of things I mentioned in this presentation though so if anyone would like to reach out by email I'm happy to provide those resources thanks so much great thanks Craig and I'll definitely get that document from you and maybe I can post it in the YouTube description box or something just so coaches can access it that's great there lots of useful tips and tricks not only for my athletes but for me as well I've been really bad for staying before bed so definitely going to implement some of these practices now does anyone have any questions for Craig yeah sure all right guys thanks for the the presentation was pretty interesting I just have a little question you said that you should exercise before sleep so do you have a like a ballpark of how long before sleep you shouldn't exercise like is it two hours or five hours over I don't I think the main thing is and again there's no it's possible but trying to limit the higher intensity exercise posted bedtimes I don't have an idea of how long I would assume one where the worst because that could result in you know higher Corozal accumulations but yeah it's timing I'm not sure like two to three hours before be enough time like because some of our our training happens III coach climbing and we coach some people that go train in the day like some some theatres which go to school who go to school before like in the day so they train during the evening and then some of them might have to go to sleep like at eight or nine or before and it would train from six to eight or more from like like that time what do you think yeah I mean I think the longer away from bedtime the better so that study I was referring to they they showed delayed and sleep waves for athletes that were trading between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m. so maybe the athletes trading closer seventy I'm doing experiences and sleep issues and I'm sure a lot of its also individual based on how the athletes how easily athletes sleep but yeah I would like I said probably the the further away from bedtime the better but the dog could also be very individual individualized so maybe we best thing to do would be maybe they've talked to the athletes or just make sure they're sleeping okay and if there aren't if they aren't then maybe there's something we can do to help but at the end of the day it also it comes down to just the nature of timing and what we can do yeah we will only make them go through the kitchen air or something like this or just maybe do our own small kitchen questionnaire yeah thank you all right question any other questions yeah Jake yeah answer the question around the tracking software Craig I was curious what platform I thought I know you said mentioned going to see the attacks and then does that kind of go to like a fillable excel sheet or does that program I guess available to the public or doesn't me you kind of created um so the source there Atlantic we have access to conduct which is a modern software so I'll use that with a couple of groups so the texts go through the conduct software and then I export all the data from the conduct website and then make those reports in Excel although yeah there's also some ports available and conductor just a little bit limited perfect all right thank you all right any last questions okay well thank you so much for joining us this morning and thank you to Craig for the presentation as mentioned earlier this will be posted on YouTube so if you have if you need to go back and check out any slides or gather any more information that will be accessible on our YouTube page so that's Canadian Sports Center Atlantic - coaches Channel and all of our previous sessions are posted on there as well our next coach coach socialization session is this evening at 7 p.m. Atlanta Standard Time so we'll have a mental performance consultant named Ashley because she'll be coming on and and discussing how we can work on our mental performance during this time of isolation and how to be mentally tough I'm to definitely check out that and then we have another session tomorrow afternoon with a dietician Angela who will be talking about relative energy deficiency in sport so a variety of topics definitely encourage you to check them out and check out our YouTube page for our past presentations so thank your own for attending and thanks Craig again for presenting if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me or to Craig give up this presentation thanks everyone Thanks", "A7EDIUQotjo": "[Music] hi this is becky nunn with nunn design and I'm a guest designer today with beadaholique to clay and crystal points to create interesting footballs such as you're seeing here what you'll need is a couple of pieces of crystal point I have a couple of jump rings that I'll be using this is already pre-mixed crystal clay so I pinched off two equal sized balls of a and B and mixed it together fully some options for designing you can use rhinestone chain and Perl X mica powders I also have some texturizing sheets to give it some interesting texture buds on these three you're not seeing any texture at all just on this one we'll also need some needle nose pliers to make sure that our flush were flush on our jump rings and a q-tip the first step is going to be making sure that you have a nice flush join on your jump ring so I'm just using two pairs of needle nose pliers holding it three o'clock and nine o'clock to make sure that I have a nice flush closure on my jump ring for this particular sample I'm going to show you how to make a blind emboss this would be using just baby powder on the texture but I'm going to actually put mica powder on the texture to pick up some other accents that you'll see in there so first we're going to go ahead and put a little bit of crystal clay onto the base of your crystal point so I pinched off a little ball worth I'm totally guessing how much I will need for this but I'm assuming that based off of the size of that crystal point I'm going to use about that much so using the palms of my hands I'm making a nice round smooth ball and then I'm going to Pat my little ball out into a little patty trying to keep it somewhat even in thickness then taking my crustal point I'm placing it in the center and then using my fingers to wrap it around the end of that crystal point now I'm using my fingers to just smooth it out and give it some interesting edges down here I like that your regular look so I'm using my finger to kind of press that down on the crystal point next to attach the jump ring onto the piece I'll take another little piece of the crystal clay and roll it into a nice ball again and then I'm going to roll it out into a little snake like shape then with my seam of my jump ring at the bottom I'm going to thread the crystal clay through like such and then attach it onto the end now I'm using my fingers to sculpt all of that together and make it seamless I'm moving the jump ring back and forth so there's a nice round Center of that clay [Music] once I have those two pieces attached and I like the shape of it I can go ahead and put a little bit of the crystal of the mica powder right on to the texturizing pad so if I wanted a blind embossed like this I would you choose baby powder here and that baby powder could be rinsed off after we were done but I'm going to try do it differently for this sample and use some mica powder right on the texturizing pad I'm going to tap that off the excess then I'm going to roll my piece across the pad or bring my pad up to the piece to create that texture I'm just wrapping it around and pressing it let's see how that looks so depending on if you like that look or not if you didn't like it you can go ahead and wipe off some of that just ripe off the crystal clay and try it again I'm going to try that again I'll show you so I'm just going to take my wet wipe I'm going to wipe off the best I can the crystal clay oh that looks really cool just just removing some of it you can see it's just making it even slider of an impression let's try it again so I what I didn't like is I flattened the piece and I want it to be more rounded I'm going to go ahead and put a little bit more mica powder down and this time I'm going to bring it to the side of my table and I'm going to roll it this way so I'm pressing down and rolling and you can use your fingers to sculpt that jump ring back into place that gives you a pretty good idea if you wanted to you could take a little bit of the rhinestone chain and wrap it around and embed that down into there like that one sample that we saw like I saw here this has no texture on it at all it just has a little bit of mica powder that's been rubbed into it and then the rhinestone chain just wrapped around inside of it takes about you have about 90 to 120 minutes to work with the crystal clay before it starts to harden but then it'll set in about two hours and then you'll have a fun little pendant using the Crystal point this is becky nunn with nunn design here at beadaholique.com a to make fun pendants thank you you", "rfgxDyNnekE": "they looked all professional and everything obviously not coming here hey let's look I know I left you the cliffhanger you know basically was actually an incline hanger alright I think we had a 5 kilogram force then let's just kind of start over on it a little bit and it's attached because remember what I said no one then we're going to get to Sir mix-a-lot here we're going to get friction on here in a minute so we got this got this somebody somebody try to play stump the chump with me today in the afternoon class and it worked pretty well in a way oh oh there goes a V fight we ok ok we're good I thought the AV crews gonna start duking it out back there all right but anyway somebody asked me in the they try to play stump the chump here and they said hey how do we know that this tension is the same and I was like hmm because it is it just is don't worry about it but that's that's a very unsatisfactory answer but the actual answer is Newton's third law because this guy is pulling on this guy so we have what an equal and opposite reaction so that's why the two tensions are the same okay right and and and the guy who asks the question actually came up with the answer he goes in the Newton's third law no way yes glad you thought of that as yeah I held off you know because I knew the answer I'd forgotten anyway all right so here's what I left off now remember what we did we're going to put this we're gonna make this guy flat all right because here's what we do is you look at the thing here's here's here's the steps you go through here's that she go through and know how to do this because I'm going to give you a frictionless I used to put friction on something like this now is this too ugly but so I'm gonna give you a frictionless thing a lot like this okay and you're going to have to figure it out all right and I might there might be the same thing but I'm gonna change what if I put the five kilogram the 1.5 kilograms here this is going to go different directions all right but anyway for right now we're going to assume that the five kilogram is going to pull it this way so you look at the whole thing and you go oh I've got an acceleration going this way so if this block is accelerating this way what's this block doing accelerating up he's got to be accelerating up okay now I think for those of you point it down I think you were getting confused with he's 1.5 G going down that's that's what's cool that's what's pulling it the other way otherwise the whole thing at the speed careening down this way now here's what you do you take each block now there is a way to do it where you take all the blocks you just send them in a straight line like a train but I don't like doing that the other thing that does is that cancels out your tensions and you get an acceleration then you have to go back to your individual systems to find the tension anyway so let's take each block so which it is you look at each block and you look at the forces working on that one and then you take this block and you look at the forces working on that let's take this one first because here's the question that got asked what is the tension what is T what is a what's the acceleration the that's and that'll be I'll tell you right now be question number one on tennis look at the diagram below find the tension in the acceleration of the system okay it's a simple question don't be worth 20 points so here and you'll go I I know how to do this I'm gonna take a look at this first thing and go okay some of the forces and I'm going to draw my Freebody diagram and the first one it's kind of tension going up it's got mg going down so I'm looking at the one point five kilogram guy okay and I'll say okay and he's got an acceleration going up this way I'm making that assumption now when I get all said and done if I get an answer that says a equals negative point five something or whatever it happens to be if a equals negative guess what that tells me I've got to go in the wrong way and better everything else is fine just don't give me a negative a a anything it's going to be a equals some positive number all right so there we go so this is racist so we look at this guy we go okay I just want you to get into this habit some of the forces in the X Direction equal what's going on here in the X Direction it's kind of a trick question but not really nothing zero nada so some of the forces in the X Direction is zero and there's just nothing on that side of the equation either now some of the forces in the Y Direction equals one point five a equals this guy times the mass which is one point five that's the first thing now we look at the forces we go okay I know it's accelerating up I said it's accelerating up I don't know what the acceleration is but it's 1.5 g it's a one point five kilogram mass and this will equal it's going to equal come on in one day it's going to equal those you think okay I thought molly was already here that is Molly by the way kids y'all moon dude okay not everybody knows and everyone in TV land no okay I've got t minus 1.5 g okay there we go oh whoa oh I need to find T I need to find a I can't do it because I only have one equation I got two unknowns so I'll go to my next thing let's look at the five kilogram block now this one remember what we did we made him flat we rotated in flat and then that gravity vector the five G vector of his weight now goes this way okay it's now caddywhompus because he's got a g vector going like this a G vector going straight down like this and then this then these two guys is what we're gonna do he's got a normal vector going up like this normal force all right so now well you know he's got normal he's pushing up with a normal force going this way there's a normal force at the table the incline pushing him up that way and since I've got a vector that's caddywhompus what do I do with all cattywampus vectors break them into components okay so going down coming back across that's 90 degrees now what's this angle right here what what's that angle it's gonna be 20 degrees we could go through a Miss crunch Meister geometric proof of similar triangles but I'm not going to I'm just gonna tell you just get into a habit that when you see the think line here then you draw your caddywhompus weight vector like this put that foot that's that angle it's 20 degrees now one of the bad things that I did was I I've kind of beat into your head that cosine goes with the x-axis and sine goes with the y-axis not this time you got to remember cosine goat is with for the adjacent leg to the triangle all right and sine goes with the opposite leg so the adjacent leg to this angle is this guy right here so he gets cosine the opposite leg is this angle so he gets the sign okay all right some of you that have had trig oh yeah oh yeah but there's quite a few in here there were had tricks I just want to make sure that you knew the seams you get one of these things make it flat and go okay this would be 5g cosine of 20 then this will be 5 gee sine of 20 that's the first thing you do with an inclined guy all right and then the second thing we do once we get those in place we go okay I'm going to take this vector and put him right here here's 5 gee sine of 20 and here's my tension come in this way T and there's all my forces acting on this guy okay there's all my forces acting so I moved him from here up to here now do I have to worry about this 5g force anymore I've I don't because I got rid of him because I broke it down into the two components that are now easy to work with I can stick them into FX and FY equations that's why I did that okay right so now let's take the sum of the forces in the x-direction sum of the forces in the x-direction oh I forgot one other thing remember he's accelerating this way so the first thing I'll write down is negative 5a because this a and this a are the same thing so that's the first thing I write down is okay Newton's second law the sum of the net force in the x-direction equals five a this is making it go five times the mass times that acceleration a which I don't know yet okay and that will equal we just look at these two guys oh here's my only - that's TD - five G times the sine of theta that sine of twenty now here's what here's the other thing that I found out in rehearsal this afternoon but the other class is when we get done I'm going to I'm going to disregard the negative signs on gravity because I've already taken care of it I've already factored it out here okay I could have made this plus five times and put the negative G in there but that's - dad gets too ugly so I just factored him out I made up - five G because he's going and he because this G is negative that's why he's going this way so I just subtract his magnitude like that okay now know I've got something to play with I can go oh I can find T and stick it in here oh but first it's taking a look at the forces in the y-direction just to get used to something here actually I want to put him above kind of like I did here because this will come in handy when we get to friction so I didn't think the sum of the forces in the y-direction now is this guy accelerating up or down is he crashing through the incline no is he flying up in the air no so he has an acceleration of zero in the Y direction right so this go I zero but I'll go ahead that will help us later on when we get to friction to go oh well he's got a normal force and here's the deal on a normal force when I push down perpendicular to the surface it's what's pushing back up perpendicular to the surface okay so if I push on this guy the normal force is going that way when I push on this guy no one for us to go and straight up if I push it in angle like this guy the normal force is perpendicular to the surface all right but now since I've laid him flat he's this end coming straight out - in mg cosine of 20 oh let's put the five in there I've G cosine of 20 and so I could go ahead and solve it to the normal force equals five G cosine of 20 if I wanted but there this I could that F of Y is not gonna help me to solve this problem but what is gonna help me is ah let's add 1.5 g to both sides and get T over here so I've got one point five A plus 1.5 g equals t aha I'm gonna take him that nothing does I'm putting right there so substituting this guy gonna plop him in for that guy they get -5 a equals 1.5 a plus 1.5 g minus 5 g sine of 20 there we go haha I have one equation and one unknown we did it we're awesome way cool let's go and finish so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take minus 5a we're gonna subtract one point five eight from both sides so we get minus one point five a city so this goes to zero equals one point five G minus five G sine of twenty all right now this comes out to be minus six point five a and this actually comes out to be like a negative three point four something like that hold on a second negative two point one there's actually Newtons because I got a mass times acceleration so I'd be negative - hey this is going to work out great because when I divide the negative 6.5 by the negative 2.1 what do I get positive a and a positive on both sides and so I so we guessed right and going the right direction so let's divide this by negative six point five divided by negative six point five and I wind up with a equals positive 0.32 meters per second squared tada now we found a we can find the acceleration now or the tension pretty quick we can just okay so for tension since I said over here T equals this well I could just put the a back in here and solve for T here if I wanted to it doesn't matter you just take this egg stick it in somewhere let's put it in here equals one point five times 0.32 plus 1.5 g and to be honest I forgot to figure out what that was so it's about 0.45 plus 14 it's about 15 point 5 Newtons there's only around 15 or 16 Newtons Eric do you have it okay all right yes this on the top part you said you already took it out with the negative in front of the five right yes so when you put that in you just put in a regular 9.8 these are taken care of because I made a negative over here also and so now when I bright so now it's just a magnitude if I'm taking care of the direction here so I'm just dealing with the magnitudes from here on out all right makes it much easier then carrying that negative night they're going plus 1.5 times negative 9.8 carrying it all the way through okay it's kind of a you know it's kind of a trust the force type thing you know in other words once you factor T Matt let it go make it just use the magnitudes is all positive now it's all good okay trust the algebra okay so this might be one of those that looks AIA is easy when you did in class now when I assign you one don't panic let's break it down step by step all right you look at this guy find an equation and when you look at one of them you'll find the equation for one thing and you'll substitute it in for the other works every time without fail all right let's talk about friction okay which friction is a good thing it's actually what's helping me walk across back and forth keeping teeny busy following me with the camera okay five so let's talk about friction let's not forget about the normal force either there's three types of friction okay there's three times how many of you have ever worked in an office or been helping somebody clean out their basement and you've had them move a filing cabinet without a dolly of course I study hall employ he's had to move lots of filing cabinets okay I move these records we have no idea why we kept them away their steer over there right well when you do that or you see everyone's tried to scoot something heavy right then didn't have wheels all right now friction friction is basically two services they had he's together okay and it's electromagnetic forces actually that are causing it and and there's no such thing as a perfectly smooth surface if you get down at the microscopic level the subatomic level that this whiteboard feels nice and smooth if I was a little electron on this thing how do we go wow look at all these peaks and valleys at different energy levels and everything else I mean it'd just be a mess that'd be it looked like they Paul okay and so those things is what that adhesion is what causes friction all right now if you've ever moved trying to scoop something without wheels to tap you like this thing perfectly example let me get it out here honestly that don't close anyway yeah I got you all right now okay yeah when I say the pulling this if pull is pushing back when it's not moving the force that's keeping okay I'm pushing this way what's the sum of the forces under snake what should that force is on it the sum of them zero because it's not moving so what's acting back what's pushing back the friction on the floor is pushing that way that is static friction because it's not moving okay and static friction looks like this the symbol for static friction looks like this static friction okay that vets and F of s equals this static friction equals mu of s mu of s mu of s that's the the small Greek letter mu times normal that's why I wanted to have all that normal stuff up here so we can look at some sliding blocks and things okay since mu of s is the normal now so push not pull on this thing now all of a sudden all we gave and it and then it starts sliding pretty easy all right now what is the net force on this thing it's going this way right all right so that is kinetic friction then that looks like F of K is that's kinetic friction then things look like this you apply a force you start applying a force these apply 42:5 here's your static friction the apply it boom here's your force that you're applying then all of a sudden bang then you get kinetic friction right here and you don't need as much force okay you don't need quite as much force hey kinetic friction equals mu of K times n and these news mu of s and mu of K are what is known as the coefficients of friction now different materials have different coefficients of friction okay there's some in your book just and they kind of make sense to you when you hear about them when you hear them because you'll be like this is your your forces your FS max this is your FC this is your maximum static friction and then your F of K stays nice and normal are nice and constant but anyway like aluminum on aluminum okay the static friction is 1.9 and the kinetic friction is 1.4 usually that's unusual in that in it how then usual to have kinetic friction greater than one maybe okay well you think about that there's your thesis that materials with kinetic friction greater than one figured it out anyway but like let's take F lon Jeff's not on Teflon the static friction is only point zero for very low friction okay whereas the kinetic friction is also point zero four in other words you're going to be given these and if you're not given them if those aren't given you will be given this and you'll be given this and you'll be asked to find what that is in fact they're all found by experiment by doing things like this okay okay so usually the kinetic friction is almost always the kinetic friction is a lot less than the static friction because you kind of break a barrier and then it requires less force alright that's good so let's do a problem and then the last kind of friction F of R or I don't know what it is but it's rolling friction and if you want to find out about that take physics 510 advanced mechanics and they'll tell you all about rolling friction because it's too hard I don't know about it I just know that things roll and then eventually they come to a stop okay but the reason they but the reason things roll is because we do have a little bit of friction we've got torque and actually this thing actually deforms a little bit okay and that's why it actually stops rolling eventually it will eventually slow down and stop rolling because it's actually got some deformity there's also sloshing around that the ink in there that are working against it and everything else but it's actually called things roll because of torque on the top and then they start to roll and then eventually they come to a stop that's why if you take a ball bearing on a steel surface it'll roll for a long long time because there's not there's very little in other words a ball bearing on the steel surface has a very small contact area okay but a tire on a road has this it's actually kind of like that it actually smushes down right so it's got a bigger contact yes question oh no okay alright okay so that's rolling friction we won't deal with it too much when we get to rotational things we'll deal with some but but not we won't try and solve problems with it okay yes right right and there's also why well actually do the static friction and kinetic friction along with rolling friction that dragster tires are big slick things why because they need the most surface area applied to the ground so that when they apply that torque they've got the most surface area applying the power to the ground to propel them forward okay and that's why racing cars have slick tires also so that they can get the most power applied to the ground to get them around the track but it's also why it's very very dangerous if it even starts to mist during a race because because they don't have tread now we have tread so that we can channel the water and so we don't have hydroplaning okay for a race car with no tread it's got a hydroplane almost instantly since there's any kind of film or water there whatsoever little hydroplane so that's why the yellow flag or the red flag comes out as soon as there's a drop array and that's all I know about NASCAR or Indy or any of that kind of stuff like I said I think I made an AJ Foyt reference well you don't even know if he's still alive okay but he was the he was the king of Indy back when I was growing up when Indy meant something all right now the show let's take a look at a friction problem it's just like what we did it's just like what we did except except we got another force we've got a frictional force working against us now fiction does not always oppose the motion for three years I thought physics I tell people fit fiction opposes the motion it doesn't you know why right here friction is actually going when I put my foot down what am i doing I'm pushing that way but what's happening because there's friction on the floor it's actually pushing me that way so that's why I can walk this way okay so that's not actually the force of friction is going with in the direction of the motion okay okay let's do this let's do a classic problem that would be on a test here comes question number two again feed in this question because question number two on your test some something like it they say got homework to do right but you can't teach physics without inclined planes and blocks all right now I'm gonna put a block on this thing okay and let's say that that smell do I give me smell here no they don't it's okay well let's say it's wood on wood let's say it's well waxed wood on wood so that way then give a creaky sound and people aren't going like this right so this is what its gonna slide down this thing right it's gonna slide down nicely and the coefficient and we're going to make that angle pretty big so that it will slide down so the coefficient of kinetic friction will make this angle pretty big so that it does slide looking like this okay we're going to call this a height of 15 meters it's going to be right up here and it's going to be 5 kilograms and this is going to be 70 degrees and the mule of KFOR our wood is 0.4 and I'm going to set this I'm going to let this thing go here's my question how fast is it going to be going into when it hits the bottom then to the dent now if I was just going to drop this thing from 15 meters you guys have known how to do that right away right because you'd be like oh well that's just a freefall problem I mean how fast is going to because mass has nothing to do with it but now it does let's figure out its final velocity all right ma'am right away I've got mg coming down like this I've got a normal force going up like this caddywhompus to that and I've got a frictional force going like this force of kinetic friction and I've got an acceleration coming down this way I don't know what this is I'm going to tell you right now what is this force right here it's coming down this way gravity times what the mass times okay okay it's gonna be five times G Robin got that much what's left when these go in there nope remember from our other diagram sine sine of 70 now you jump the gun on it you're jumping at now those are all the forces that are at work so far well we've got five G here and then we've got this one here okay so let's join flat this time we're gonna rotate it down this way so let's draw this guy nice and flat so what we're going to do is we're going to figure out what is constant acceleration is when those constant acceleration because we know an angle and we know the height we can figure out the hypotenuse so we can figure out how far you went so we can find this final velocity because its final velocity we're gonna say okay well it's final velocity squared is going to equal V naught squared plus 2a times the distance D that he went and here's the distance D and I'll show you how to find that distance D here in a minute this is what we're after but we got to find this guy first I got to find the acceleration so that's why I've got to go to my force diagrams their thing yeah when we get to chapter five and we look at energy things you're going to find out that if we even if we neglect evil with friction that there's a much easier way to find the final velocity okay so here we go let's take a look at the forces here now the first thing we do is we draw this five kilogram guy and we draw a force it looks like this that's our five g and here's what i stumped robin because she's like well it's 5 to 5 g but we got to break him into his two pieces Oh actually five g's gonna go the other way I'm sorry it's gonna go like this because I brought him down like that so five g's gonna go shoot it off this way and this is going to be it would have been way out here but this will be 70 degrees this is not drawn to scale by any stretch okay all right and so this will be mg or this would be 5g cosine of 70 and this would be five gee sine of 70 so that's the sky 5g sine of 70 and then I've got the kinetic frictional force pushing back this way I've got the normal force going up here so let's take a look at the sum of the forces in the Y direction now I didn't say anything in a problem not being cute or anything like that saying oh he's so heavy that he's crashing through the thing at the same time now we're not doing I'm not gonna play that one so what's the sum of the forces in the oh I forgot this guy we got to put the acceleration and I'm going to assume the acceleration is going that way in the x-direction I'm assuming he's going this way okay so some of the forces in the y-direction are going up is the normal force minus mg r 5g times the cosine of 70 and that equals zero so N equals 5g cosine of 70 and there's a method to my madness why I always start with the y-direction because especially when you're dealing with friction that's where I get my frictional force because if you remember you've seen it once in your whole life and I erased it after 30 seconds so you probably don't remember we said that the frictional force F of K equals the mule of K times 5g cosine of 70 what we're after you might be going well what are we after we're after a we've got to find a so that I can finish the problem I'll find D quick enough using a little trig I'll use the inverse sine of 15 I'll just divide 15 by the sine of 70 and get get what D is there's something making weird noises okay all right I thought it was my stomach growling but it's not all right so now we got now some of the forces in the x-direction okay we can do this we can do this we've got f of x equals well only two guys oh where are we supposed to put 5a right don't forget him because Newton's second law the net forces in the x-direction are causing that acceleration times the mass okay so we've got 5a and this'll equal the positive guy is 5 g sine-theta sign of 70 - nu k 5g cosine 70 so I'm going to divide both sides by a or by five then i get the acceleration is equal to g sine of 70 minus nu k g cosine of 70 and I forgot my calculator somebody have one Andy oh is that an 89 I don't know how to work those ah there we go you know a high school teacher ti-84 plus okay so I got nine point eight times sine of 70 minus point four times 9.8 cosine of seventy that's five point one meters per second squared then I looked really hot and scary when we first started right look like oh my gosh Nev case point for who decided me if K was point four okay so does that make sense to us in other words if something is being held up sliding down it's not sliding at 9.8 meters per second squared right let's go a little bit slower than gravity quite a bit slower just like half okay that's what I'm trying to be right out of my gourd I don't know why I'm sure you all go man all right okay yeah so if you figure out the final velocity I'll just tell you right now D is equal to 15 divided by the sine of 70 because D sine of 70 equals 15 so thank you Rachel what we get are you a radians Oh fifteen point nine Cylons call it sixty good enough fifteen point nine six let us say sixteen meters which makes sense seventy degree angle is pretty big okay so we've got V squared so VF squared will equal zero squared plus two times five point one times sixteen and so VF equals the square root of ten point one times our ten yeah roughly the square root of 165 will say ballpark it twenty times twenty four hundred thirteen times thirteen is 169 right so this is about 13 meters but I'd say twelve point eight seven that's twelve point eight 400 Wow I can still guess with the best of them twelve point eight meters per second that's how fast it's going now if it's just in freefall it'd be quite a bit more this would be nine point eight so it really be careening down there would be going twice as fat white a bit faster we're not quite twice as fast okay all right so that's the way you do friction and and that's so let's put it all together here Wow there should be more than this no we've pretty much done it all one thing I do want to tell you about now let's take a look at we're going to do the Superman problem which I kind of liked it's at the end of the book into the chapter but first let's look a little bit more at the normal force here let's look at static conditions okay at static conditions let's say I've got a block sitting on the carpet okay I got a list I like five kilograms I don't know why you're just kind of stuck with five kilograms okay and I'm gonna apply a force of 40 Newtons to this guy at an angle of 30 degrees so those of you who nobody can see that I'm applying a force of 40 Newtons at an angle of 30 degrees below the horizontal like that okay know what I want to figure out so I'm pushing on it at an angle what's that going to do if I didn't have a force there that 40 Newton force wasn't there what would be the normal force for this block there's a block sits in there by itself sitting on the ground just like my book sitting on that table what's the normal force yeah it's got it was Phi G right okay so right we I'm very picky so this is going down Phi G so the sum of the forces in the Y Direction here are equal to zero because it's not accelerating but I've got a normal force minus 5 g and so the normal force equals 5 g now I've got a question for you what I push push on it like this what happens to the normal force it should do what decrease or increase if oh if I'm pulling on it like this M will decrease if I'm pushing on it like this it's gonna go up right because look let's look at the sum of the forces so you have some of the forces here it's almost like if you want if you want to get smacked when your wife is on a diet or something like that she's weighing herself you come up behind her real quiet put your toe on the scale no boying because basically these scales giving you the normal force because it's taking in G but if you add to it anyway they're already crazy anyway when they're dieting but oh sorry I digress okay so anyway we've got five G going down we got normal force going up so let's take a look and so let's take a look at the free body diagram here we've got five G normal force I've got f of X going like this I've got F of Y coming down because I'm going to break him into his components here's F of X here's F of Y and I've also got since he's not moving there's got to be something holding him back and that's the static frictional force which would be this way okay so I can figure out what that static frictional force is pushing it back yeah an interesting problem would be what force do I need to push with f of X to get it to move let's do that let's say I don't push on it with a force I don't know the force let's say F I don't know what's going to get it to move do I need to get this to move that's a good question well of course I need to get this to move well what I have to do is I have to overcome FS max I have to overcome this so right at the cusp of that force will I got to figure out what for set is is going to make that equal to zero so let's do this it's still at 30 degrees okay so I'm going to take a look at my some of my forces in the y-direction it's not flying off in the air it's not crashing through the ground so Newton's second law says the net force is equal to zero it's not accelerating and it actually it's not accelerating in the a direction either I'm gonna find out right when I get that what force do I need just a little bit more of and then it'll start to accelerate so but that equals the normal force minus FY minus 5g they'll notice the normal force now equals FY + 5 g when I bring these guys over here I'm going to add FY to both sides and add 5g to both sides to the zero and so you can see now mathematically why that normal force increase is quite a bit okay and so the normal force is equal to F sine of 30 plus 5g okay and that's the frictional force the static frictional force is going to equal mu of s no we said it's a carpet let's same you the static friction is 0.84 because it's carpet times this F sine 30 + 5 g okay now so I got two of those I don't know this kind of don't know okay so let's come up with another equation well we've got this we got the sum of the forces in the x-direction it's also not quite accelerating okay just on the cusp not quite accelerating so it equals zero and what do we have here we've got FS oh sorry we've got FX we've got F cosine of 30 minus FS so now I've got to stick all this in there we've got F cosine 30 - knew of s times F sine 30 oh my goodness sine 30 plus five G equals zero okay let's do a little algebra F cosine 30 - from us F sine 30 minus U of S five G equals zero I multiplied that all the way through okay now I'm going to add new of s5g to both sides I'm going to factor out my F so I got F cosine 30 or cosine of 30 I keep putting theta in there - mu of s sine 30 equals nu of s times 5g because I added that to both sides now the force that I need to get that thing to move will be mu of s 5g divided by cosine 30 minus mu of s sine 30 boy is that ugly or what that's ugly whoo it's kind of when to come up with an easy example that I made it hard bidding follow the argument so let's do Superman real quick the risk of killing you all alright so we'll leave that up for a minute we're just looking at all the forces in infection now here's the deal we got Superman comes in all right we're traveling at 90 miles an hour in a car okay the driver applies the brakes to his fascinating kind skids out of control and a wet concrete horizontal road or an icy concrete or as I rode the car the 2,000 kilogram cars directly toward a student waiting to catch a bus on campus who is standing 58 meters down the road or in my case I don't know how many students I have almost ran over here because they're texting and they're walking over to cook fair and it just kind of wander across Rock Hill in the middle of like what are you doing lost your mind very but I don't hit him because fortunately Superman comes swooping down overhead and surveys the situation remembering from his physics class I guess they have physics on Krypton than any way that the coefficient of kinetic friction between rubber and rough wet concrete is 0.8 he quickly determines that friction will not stop the car in time so he flies down exerts a constant force of 13,000 Newton's on the cars hood at a downward angle of 30 degrees did he save the student we'll find out so here we go let's take a look what Superman's doing here he knows that there's friction being applied that there's kinetic friction now when you're in a skid kinetic friction opposes the motion hey I wanted to set up this problem just if nothing else to set it up because here's the car now the car actually hasn't philosophy going this way but since it's slammed on its brakes well since Superman's stay in front of it and slowing it down which ways the acceleration going the other way right so you can still have a velocity going this way but you can have an acceleration going that way that's how we stopped okay and if we and if every time our if enough our acceleration always followed our velocity like I said we'd be dropping transmissions all over the place because as soon as you put on your brakes your car go the other way so you don't do that so the velocities going this way but he's got a little force of kinetic friction going this way between him and the road okay the mass of the car is 2,000 kilograms and it was going 90 miles an hour so a quick conversion of the the initial velocity was 90 miles per hour quick conversion take that times 0.447 that's your conversion to meters per second come up with about forty meters per second it'll is that great curveball okay all right now Superman pushes down on this thing at 30 degrees with a force of 13,000 Newtons okay that's a 30-degree so we'll break that into its two components and of course we've got the mg of the car and we got the normal force there's our free body diagram of what's going on what's the first thing we need to do but we're going to break down into components here anything caddywhompus here do you think in a name right Superman its force okay and we'll take the sum of the forces in the x-direction and the sum of the forces in the y-direction let's start with the sum of the forces in the y-direction so we've got Superman's force yeah okay so let's let's get a clean board I always start with y because that's where we're going to get our kinetic for now these are forces that are being applied to the 2000 kilogram car okay these are forces being applied we want to know if this is going to stop will D equal 58 feet okay first thing we need to do let's figure out what the acceleration is that we need what's the deacceleration that we need this is the way I attack the problem I don't know how they did it but this is I would go oh then V final I want to be zero and so I'm going to go zero equals forty meters per second squared - 2a times 58 and so I get to a times 58 equals 16 hundred and so sixteen hundred divided by 116 that would be my acceleration that I need to slow down okay that's going to be my d acceleration which in this case is actually going in the positive x-direction because that's what Superman is pushing the car okay which I don't know what that is but i roughly worked this out ahead of time is it's roughly about 13.7 meters per second squared that's what's going to be required to make us come to a stop so let's see if our overall acceleration here now remember so this this means we've got an acceleration going this way let's see if we're going to find a and if a is less is greater than 13.7 we saved the day Superman saved the student okay does that all make sense to us so far okay good now so we got the sum of the forces in the y-direction is going to equal zero this is not that's the second law not going anywhere and we've got the normal force minus mg - thirteen thousand times the sine of thirty sign of 30s actually happens to be 0.5 so I know that 2000 times 9.8 + 6500 equals the normal force what I did was I just added both these guys over here okay and I did the I you just eventually know that the sine of 30 is 0.5 it's none of these things when you've done it for a while okay and so when you do that the more the force is equal to 26100 Newton's remember the normal forces and Newton's ma'am the kinetic friction then the kinetic frictional force is equal to mu of K which we said was what I had point eight is that what we said that was earlier problem this is point eight we have K sorry to give you all the data you have K is equal to point eight okay so the B 0.8 times 26100 high so now see I used my Y components even though it's not accelerating anywhere to find my frictional force that's what it's good for okay all right now some of the forces in the y-direction our X Direction is equal to the mass of the car times some acceleration is equal to this MA which looks like we've got it's all positive we've got F of K so we've got 0.8 well let me write it up algebraically first you got F of k plus 13,000 times the cosine of 30 well look at that we've got all numbers this is great so the acceleration is going to equal point eight times twenty six thousand one hundred plus thirteen thousand cosine cosine of thirty is about point eight six did I do the calculations here well no it's times thirteen thousand cosine 230 okay divided by two thousand and we need when that's all said and done a equals I did get this far 16 meters per second squared did Superman save the person with a lot of room to spare because if we put in if we put in 16 here and solve for D for the distance there'll be a much less comes out to be like 50 so by 8 meters 24 feet he saves the students life yay that's putting all the ideas together in Chapter four we didn't do any one type of problem that will give you okay we've got time to do it on Thursday we got to look more at when I push on something then it pushes back how that Newton's third law we got looking a little", "Pf2A9SzW6YY": "[Music] i need this [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys so we're about to go for a ride in geo's 1200 horsepower aim-built board this thing has been a beast all day on the track and i just i told him we had to go for a spin on this thing i got to feel it all right so this is a special day for the og trc fam when was the last time i've been in a street car of yours 2013. i'm pretty sure it was 23 the same night that i met you girl the same night bro you grow dx2k i walk up to some random dude with one of the most gorgeous subarus i have ever seen in my life and it made like 1300 or eleven hundred thousand hundred hundred at the time that was like one of the best racing nights of my life and i was like i was literally like 130 pounds heavier sure that you were not expecting the shifter to be worked that way by a big dude that was like the best night of racing of my entire life it's good to be back wow wow dude i don't know if i've ever been in a manual porsche that's this fast legit bro i think this is the fastest manual porch i've ever been in wow and like like always you are banging gears in this thing man that is my absolute favorite part of this car you know like i'm a 6b fan hardcore people sometimes give me you know crappy because i obviously i drive a race car that has a th400 but at the end of the day i'm a true clutch fan i mean i i probably could have had a 991 with the amount of money that was invested in this car but i didn't want that i wanted a manual transmission card as far as i'm concerned this is one of the best platforms so i mean this is uh this is not a dog box this is a bone stock 72 000 mile transmission that's wild i mean like the i don't know if it's going to come off on video but the the loud like banging noise that like he's he's raping this drive drivetrain and it's taking it like i said holy i was uh you know when i started this car was you know has always been one of my dream cars i absolutely love super guys i'm a super fanatic i'm always going to have a supra but this was the car that i always you know wanted so um you know hopefully i'll be able to have another 6-speed supra but it's not going to be i'm not replacing it with this car it would be next to it because they both have their place you know but yeah when i started looking around and people are making you know 15 1600 horsepower through bone stock 997 transmissions rubbing to 9 000. really yeah dude that's what those name guys are doing and i mean i saw that i'm like i gotta have it i gotta do that i mean thankfully i had a relationship with those guys already and it was just super easy like we're you know the super guys if you know we hope that if you have a super pro we get to be a part of your build when i saw what they were doing it was a no-brainer i wasn't going to try to do what they do and take years to perfect some platform i was like nope i'm letting you guys handle it i want that just give me exactly what you have i didn't end up going too crazy because you know these cars can get up there and i didn't want to i didn't want to ruin the car so i built you know i hadn't built me something that i thought was going to be 100 reliable it's going to come up to power it's not going to be anything crazy so we uh we i asked for a thousand i ended up with 1200 wheel you know and it seems like a 1200 wheel 7 500 rpm is a very very happy place for this car kind of like a supra is like a a thousand horsepower it's like the number for a supra after that things get a little crazy you know the the guys that make 1600 there are some bad days of 1600 1000 horsepower supra incredible all day all day so it looks like the 997 1200 1300 all day you know i got this car today is a decent testament i think you have more time slips than anybody out there right now i think you were you were hot lapping it against the tier 2 sequential evo and then tim comes over he's like well i got to let it cool like we've just ran four times back-to-back and honestly you're you're putting this thing throughout i think you've had like you said you had it you got it back what december december and i think i'm i'm pretty sure that i've probably got more hits in this car than most of the of the you know most of the guys that do this type of thing like that a lot of porsche guys are not super hardcore you know that right it's a different clientele obviously but it's because i think people don't understand that this platform can do things like this you know so it's kind of like these transmissions could hold so much power i honestly think that's like it's like get ranked territory you know like that's that's awesome yeah so that's good you're gonna have to drive it i don't even have to like think about that okay i will absolutely take you up on there all right so let's do that [Music] ah what do you think that is a good time dude this you just made you just you just made me fall in love with porsches i just know left in a five to six fish it is it is just pure bliss this car it's like okay so you like brake boosting it right and it gets squirrely on the head because it's it's making a ton of power it's all-wheel drive but it like broke traction a little bit from there it was rock solid planted and it's it's just it's an experience that's honestly the only way i can explain it it's so different than like the pull of like a super like just as a comparison but wow man it's a different animal i tell you i mean i like this car because it's so raw it's so raw yeah very controlled a supra extreme rawness i love it for that because it's a wild ride that's a perfect way to explain it yeah this is wild for a second and then it's controlled and then let's go and my favorite part it actually has usable back seats yeah either kids or adults with no legs or one or the other you know but like yeah dude like you have full interior we have the ac blasting you just ran 167 167 a little bit quicker the car the power band on this car is ridiculous you know it's funny because whenever i was talking to those guys uh that aim and they were going to build their car and they used to tell me it's like listen man a thousand horsepower in that car it's not a thousand horsepower like on other six loading applications i mean this thing is gonna make a thousand foot pounds of torque from 4000 rpm all the way up you know so it's a it's a very different power van it has power for days i could shift this car slow and the boost recovery happens immediately so you know it's a really really cool platform i'm extremely happy with it i think i don't i don't need to make it faster i've uh you know i've been around long enough to know that you know there's a line for every car and i think i'm at a very very good spot so i think you're going to really enjoy driving this car well you really might have to buy one so this this might be very expensive just from just from writing it i can already tell you like so i've been like i've always been a porsche fan and while all the pdks they perform like incredibly like i would want a manual one i didn't know that these like factory transmissions were so sturdy like so stout and and this car is expensive the experience in this car is just is wild like you know i i wanted my goal was to be able to go 200 and a half mile i run nines on the street with a six-speed car and 19-inch hre wheels and i did it it went 201 the first time i went to the to the half mile and i went 9-7 at 161 on off the shoulder on some random bridges quarter mind [Music] foreign yes [Music] you know and i could do that all day even on the lower business and i know with more seed time i can definitely go further into the nines on on no prep with a stick shift car i mean i mean rolling it's damn near 170 mile an hour car oh yeah for like i mean just for some perspective the trc sequentially though all in has been like 165. like you don't really pull up to the club in an evo but like this thing you could take you know out with the wife and then you can go to the racetrack for sure so cool speaking of that today was the first time my wife actually got in the car so i'm happy that she's nice we went 159 on lower boost levels i wasn't trying to go crazy i let off like at 170 so how'd she like it oh she absolutely loved it i wish she could if she could drive six speed she would definitely be all about it but be careful you asked for man she might be asking you for a car soon oh that might be that real expensive real fast yeah let me forget about that all right man so i'm gonna hand over the keys and i'm gonna let you do your thing you're gonna buy one my man thank you so much brother all right guys so geo was nice enough to let me let me take this thing for a spin i think it's making about 1200 right now so i am super freaking stoked i've never actually driven a manual porsche so let's see how it goes just an fyi you guys just saw geo beat the crap out of this thing i'm gonna be a lot nicer to it ready bro yes sir damn bruh yeah so he said take it to about 4000 rpm just matted [Music] damn bro this thing rides out holy hell this thing rides bro i need this this is sick this is addictive dude this thing will get you in trouble bro yes this thing will get you in trouble real quick that's a rush bro dude yeah absolutely and now we're just chilling honestly this is probably one of the most fun cars we've been in wow like it's it's just rowdy enough like like shifting you know it's like raw though yeah it's like it's a it's like a it's i consider this like a supercar right yeah but it's like it's like still raw yeah like we've driven other dcd porsches but this is like it adds that the rawness back into the mix and it's just the perfect bit of everything right it's so sweet oh man i like your little light rolling third gear let her eat bro [Music] bro oh my god wow bro yes oh yes oh my god geo was not kidding wow i know a guy that'll take that r32 off your hands you can pick one of these up geo my man you were not kidding so we don't have to turn back into the track yeah i think we ought to just head on back you know yeah i'm not gonna lie i was a little worried when geo got a porsche because the paces that he puts through his cars is not like the average person yeah especially like in like the porsche community it's more just like it's a different crowd they're not all racers you know yeah but damn this thing this thing is mega badass it's too much fun this is something else man i'm honestly gonna just absolutely without a doubt certified drc at room hundred percent [Music] thank you so much for that experience man this is honestly you were absolutely right you were absolutely right like this right here i have so many thoughts going through my head and future life decisions that i shouldn't probably make like if you're a fan of a clutch this is this is one of the cars the one thing i was a little iffy about at first i was like man i don't want to shift it too fast like i don't know butter smooth motors that i've ever had that shifted better than this stock was the s2000 and this is as close to an s 2000 as you could possibly get and again 72 000 mile never open transmission no it's man and i shift that thing you see it no it's broken it's not the fastest thing in the world it's not the slowest it's just extremely fun this is yeah oh dude it's unbelievably fast but we drove some of those dct porsches before but this is like it adds everything back that you're missing from that and it's something else not only that the size of the cars you know this is about the same size of the supra i mean again i'm a big super guy this is the closest thing that i could get to super that was just in my opinion the next step you know they both have their all-wheel drive bro it's just the right amount of shoes if you drive this car and don't come back with a smile on your face i don't know yeah you're doing something wrong a supra unless you're a driver it's harder to race that car because if you shift it slow it takes forever to come into this thing i mean it makes all the power like you can floor it at 3 rpm and it just happens like that there's so much brother of course i'm glad you know congratulations driving except you know the guys that built it and if i was gonna let somebody drive it's gonna be you thank you now i gotta convince jay to drive it i think he's afraid because he's gonna love him [Music] we're here with geo 2008 911 turbo six speed man pedal that's right so tell me a little bit about the car because i've been listening to this thing all day and it sounds freaking amazing yeah so it's a car that i uh i got from a good friend um he basically got it with 13 000 miles and did an alpha 9 package i bought it with him from home whenever i had the alpha 9 package you know it was a fast car i brought it you know here went 10 30 at like 137 i definitely wanted the car to be a little bit quicker than that so basically i have the guys that aim performance build you know one of their fast setups as soon as i started looking at who was actually going fast in these cars they were the only ones that were doing the things that i knew that i was going to do which was ripping on the street like actually racing you know i already had a good relationship with those guys so it was uh it was simple you know we we do supras they do porsches and i got the car over to them i told them what i wanted and literally i got the car back in december and on the same day that they delivered the car we went to cape canaveral to johnny johnny bowmer's uh proving grounds and uh did 201 in the half mile one of my goals that originally it escalated originally i wanted a thousand and then ended up making you know 1205 to the wheels i went 200 and a half mile the first time i went 9-7 on the street off you know off some random bridge you know at 161. it's an awesome setup that's unbelievable yeah it's pushed those kind of numbers right at the gate too just getting the car back and that's a significant power difference from the old setup right it's about three 400 horsepower almost more with their turbo kit uh precision 6262's uh were the turbos uh that we decided to go with just because we didn't want to run a lot of boost to make the power that we want and it ended up making 1067 on 30 which is how i drive the car perfect the majority of time really happy there and then you know i have another map for uh things like this where i go from you know 32 to 35 pound ramp and it makes 1205 to the wheel that's pretty impressive for five more pounds on there too well those turbos are very efficient yeah that's amazing unfortunately i'm out of fuel system um the car escalated you know originally i told them a number and we ended up going with six injector dynamics injectors knowing what i know now i probably would have done a 12 injector setup but it's one of those things where i'm very happy with with what we have going right now it's a streetable car yes you know super basic it's a you know 3.8 liter build um you know rps carbon clutch cybex tuned by uh es motors which you know whenever i started looking at the other porsches like the guy you know was emery from es motor so having somebody like that uh behind the keyboard is is awesome and ever since i got it i today was actually the first time i popped the hood i hadn't popped the hood in a month and a half so there's not too much going on in the hood over here absolutely badass car looking forward to watching you do some more passes on the track today [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "4ht7ToTY7d8": "this one guys is having okay right here i just look you know you guys can roll cones pretty easily all right so what you do as you got your papers right the box paper thing all right so you cut up the top part right or sometimes you use it for scooping whatever right i'm using the top part the ucb one which is these ocb papers and then your your cone on top of whatever you don't smoke or whatever you can still roll all of that so but you know i roll sometimes on the cigarette you know put it on the cigarette roll like stick take it out take it out to the point put in the cone pack it in the cone pounds are not hard if you don't know how to roll weave you should at least know how to roll coach don't forget to like and subscribe on the youtube channel i don't know when this is going to be uploaded i got a couple of videos to be uploaded you can see the girls are packed dude perfectly all right then what you can do is thank you i don't know this is one grams of this laughter figure could be half gram and then just like like you know filter or like kind of cardboard mostly like the cardboard like the ones out on your papers or the ones in the back and but not so tight to the point where you can't breathe right like like the one grab that they roll or if i roll one grams i like to roll this way all right or it's like a cigarette style whichever paper i use either ocbs or raw but i prefer more off that's the paper so ocds are nice too and these are really good yeah it's almost half of it oh he spoke three around i think it was around two i smell three round two i smell um cut back smoked wine smoked another two and then this one will be three this one folks expensive oh my god there's a spider here [Music] i don't bother anything like that but i prefer to relax smoke yeah you know oh what are you really supposed to see there's a usual thing smoke right so like i do switch it up and when i smoked i tried the elk kush 47 which has just the oakfish 47 not the not the one crossing the warlock it's totally different but it cuts to the high see how it shows you okay there's a mouse here oh huh unpack them in just the right amount not too tight all right you want them tight i can't see up to 10 minutes well like uh i think this is about one gram or a half gram or seven but that's what it was this is gg number four so all right so i don't also got more luck too but i'm ready bust down the gt number four i got one of those like celestia gg number four two of them i bust them now i rolled into this so but i did get the warlock too at the blitz today i got the the buds which is which is it's about 15 14 for two joints for 699 seven dollars my half grams that's that bad okay past 10 minutes wow yeah well it should be past 10 minutes because i smoked a bit of cigarettes like a minute too be requested right also they can run gaming you can't run gaming at twitter i'd also facebook them if i get that correctly oh hey what's up all right so there ain't much love just like a roach i'll put you to the edge usually i'll keep broadcasting all right i'm using my foot as a kickstand almost oh don't forget to like and subscribe

Chandra thanks so much for joining us now we're talking about a ban which is about three years out if it happens what does it mean trans fats what are those and how bad is it for us Mike the trans fats actually were manufactured about a hundred years ago oh wow and if you know Crisco was the first trans fat that started selling its products in 1950 trans fats have been used by manufacturers because they improve the flavor of food and they can actually improve the shelf life but for the last 15 years we have found that they have some really bad effects on health mostly on heart disease we have about a hundred thousand people who may have debts attributed to trans fats because of their prevalence in manufactured foods what would it mean for these to be eliminated from our diet would we be a much healthier nation if this were to happen of course trans fats caused a significant loss of health by increasing the bad fats in our system and reducing the good fats they increase the risk of heart disease diabetes and if you remove these fats from manufactured foods processed foods fast foods then we are obviously going to improve the health of our communities you said good fats which is kind of funny to hear that but there are Google oh there are in fact the research has shown that we should actually improve and increase our consumption of good fats and they go as polyunsaturated fats mono and saturated fats olive oil is good for you walnuts fish which is the FDA wants you to have two servings of fish every week so if you increase your consumption of good fats you are actually in a better position to reduce heart disease do you think this will make food not taste as good or are we going to have a problem with that in fact what they have found it which is really like because a lot of friars you have trans fats because they improve the taste of food voluntarily a lot of fast food chains including KFC Wendy's in 2006 made voluntary reductions of their trans fat use and the FD has now ruled that over the next three years all trans fats will be reduced from foods which are in the market yeah they're going to have to figure out something because come 2018 we've got to get rid of it so thanks for explaining appreciated thanks recommend that learn more about the trans fat ban just go to our website it's fox45 now.com dr. Saunders thanks again appreciated", "4Kkb0FzTBmc": "on-site vibration analyzer calibration a webinar presented by the modal shop and pcb pisatronics my name is mike scott i am the industrial product manager at the modal shop and today we'll talk about the technical concepts of how to calibrate a portable vibration analyzer on site either electrically or mechanically this is the final webinar of the 2021 industrial market series again presented by modal shop and pcb pisatronics you can see the list of previous webinars there all of these webinars are available on our youtube channel and i have a slide at the end of the presentation to showcase that but you can always go back and re-watch any of these webinars on our youtube channel just real quick on some of the topics we we have a digital accelerometer that turns your phone into a vibration analyzer we talked about calibrating differential charge accelerometers on gas turbines we talked about automatic tank gauging and liquid level measurements we had a webinar february 11 on combustion dynamics february 18th was wireless vibration monitoring and last week my friend mike nero presented on 4 to 20 milliamp vibration transmitters some of you came to this webinar because you were invited by the modal shop and some were invited by pcb pisatronics so let me just say something quickly about each company but the modal shop is located in cincinnati ohio that's probably going to come into play later and uh we are a world leader in uh in metrology we're a calibration lab here we have a scope of accreditation on a2la.org and of course on our website with stated uncertainties we create we manufacture calibration systems here including the portable vibration calibrator we also have rental um structural test products and non-destructive testing systems pcb pisatronics is just outside of buffalo new york in depuy it's about 10 minutes or 15 minutes the way i drive from downtown buffalo i'm a slow driver i've been getting passed in the right lane a lot lately i'm in the middle and people pass me on the right i feel like i'm driving in michigan where you know school buses pass me and anyway um pcb is just outside of buffalo new york and uh it is uh might be the largest i don't know if i can say the largest but at least one of the largest uh piezoelectric uh vibration sensor manufacturers in the world when i started a pcb it was only one building it was uh let me try to use the pointer here it was uh just the building that you see here but now they've expanded to a machine shop that runs 24 7 in this building here um this used to be a wine wholesaler when i started at pcb about 16 or 17 years ago but the the building has really expanded they also have manufacturing in north carolina as well and some other places but the vibration sensors are mostly made here at pcb in buffalo and in north carolina it's completely vertically integrated facility where you know raw parts are coming out of the machine shop for advanced assembly under microscopes over here on the uh the right hand side and they make some of the best accelerometers in the business tri sheer tri-axial designs with full frequency sweep calibrations which is going to come into play later in this presentation if i can just only get on my soapbox for a little bit but the sensors made here at pcb are the best in the world uh this is me so yeah um what do i want to say well i've been here at modal shop for six or seven years now i remember it all blurs into one big beating and previously i worked at uh pcb pisatronics so i sort of transferred within the company if you will from buffalo new york to cincinnati ohio got out of the cold a little bit got out of the cold in the snow i did pass a cat to a vibration exam conducted by vibration institute dave corelli was my instructor and uh yeah for 40 years i've been a fan of some of the least successful sports teams on the planet none of them have ever won a championship so just recently i got into uh champions league soccer or european football and my wife and i went to some games on a trip to uh to england and we watched the premier league as well and we just decided to be supporters of every good uh european football team that you can possibly imagine and then this so we just bought scarves for all of them so i own like uh i got psg i got manchester city and manchester united i got liverpool um i got bayern anything you name it i got it so that whoever wins we can celebrate and with our team because we're so tired of losing in all the other sports i figured you know why not just be a fan of all the best teams in uh in european football and then we can't go wrong so that's that's how we decided to roll with it so here at uh pcb and the modal shop we understand powergen we understand the industrial vibration monitoring market we offer a lot of different solutions uh vibration monitoring system verification troubleshooting the verification of uh of alerts and alarms we offer ground fault detection systems that monitor for straight current and poor resistance on a brushless generator we offer troubleshooting for proximity probes we don't make proximity probes of course we have combustion dynamics pressure sensors and industrial hygiene products so there's a lot of instrumentation available through our group of companies for the industrial vibration market and for the specifically for the energy market if you will and oil and gas as well um you know both of those markets so let's get into it when we uh advertise this webinar we somewhat playfully advertise this as ditch the service contract but to be fair product support plans offer more than just calibration and repair of the analyzer we're going to be talking about calibration of the vibration analyzer today it doesn't mean that you can just ditch the service contract if you will it all depends so um most of the offering in a service contract centers around technical support which the vendors like to break up into a lot of different variations to sort of bulk up the the value prop of the plant you know if you have a piece of marketing literature there's going to be three or four bullet points just on support you know it'll say well you can call whenever you want you can email whenever you want you can have access to a self-guided uh tutorial uh where you can link up with other experts in the industry and share your you know there's there's a lot of value there but a lot of it's centered around uh technical support um you know personally i don't connect so much with the value proposition of the service plan i've i've never really met with a vibration analyst that raved about the service plan but i understand why you know it's i understand why people go for it um to me it feels more like a necessary evil if you will you know all of the all of the companies are doing service plans so you don't have much of a choice as to whether or not you um you you go for it because if you don't go for it you might not be able to get the technical support when you need it so just because you can calibrate your own vibration analyzer doesn't mean that you can you can ditch the service plan you know the um and the support is certainly the biggest thing you know to me it's you know you know i grew up in buffalo new york and here in cincinnati it snows like once or twice a year but every single um every single condo downtown i live right downtown i got a condo everyone we looked at had an hos you know a homeowners association and part of what you paid for was snow removal and it just drove me nuts because you pay 25 a month for snow removal and it only snows once or twice a year you know i'm from buffalo i can handle the snow i'll take care of it on my own it's fine so you know it it's um it's difficult you know you might say well i spent three hundred thousand dollars on a dozen analyzers for my team you know why can't i get technical support see here i am getting on my soapbox again so can you ditch the service contract not necessarily it depends whether or not you value some of the other elements our our goal in this presentation is to sort of teach you how you can do on-site portable vibration analyzer calibration and leave it at that um the the uh the goal of the webinar is to show you that element of it and then it's kind of up to you as to uh whether or not you um uh i think this is the wrong slide actually there we go uh as smaller piggy bank i wanted the picture on the slide up to you as to whether or not you still connect with the remaining elements of the value proposition if you take for the service contract if you take calibration and start to do it on your own so if you can execute on-site vibration analyzer calibration the the elements in blue on the slide are suddenly under your control obviously the calibration is done by yourself and would include the accelerometer if you went with the mechanical method which i'll talk about later and because you're doing the calibration of the analyzer on site it doesn't need to ship anywhere which depending upon who you use it could take a long time for the analyzer to come and go now sometimes they do offer a replacement analyzer while your unit is in for recalibration and then of course from a tech support standpoint if you can immediately validate the measurements that are being made by the analyzer you do remove one of the failure modes uh regarding uh the acquisition of bad data if you're getting some strange results an immediate recalibration of the accelerometer computer and vibration analyzer could be useful to you as far as just making sure that you acquired quality data the rest of the service contract of course remains in place technical support e-learning the self-help portal etc sometimes you get an analysis services and of course repairs and cleaning of the analyzer itself so whether or not you can uh save on the service contract kind of depends uh upon whether or not the oem is flexible with that value proposition can you pay for certain things a la carte when you need them or do you always need to buy the whole contract whether you value it or not um can you pick and choose the services that you offer can you have access to technical support without paying for calibration you know these are all questions that i can't answer but um you know you can evaluate it with your service provider to see if maybe there's a cost savings to be had there can i really calibrate the analyzer myself yes there are two methods there's the mechanical method and the electrical method which we'll talk about in a moment but first you should know that unlike accelerometers there's no standard that governs vibration analyzer calibration and the analyzer oems you know like skf or emerson allen bradley and tech ird whatever you want to call them azima dli a-none of them are accredited for their calibrations the analyzers can be calibrated in a lot of different ways you could look at amplitude linearity you could look at accuracy accuracy of the frequency measurement you could do multiple points you can do a single point and that's part of the problem um to doing it yourself there's not exactly a blueprint for how to do it uh the picture on the right bottom right is snipped right out of the iso 16063 standard for accelerometers so for accelerometers there's actually a standard and and it provides a blueprint so that people have some instruction whereas with a portable vibration analyzer it's kind of the wild west in a way and the oems are not consistent as far as what they provide on the calibration certificate and a lot of people just want to default to to sending the analyzer back to the oem and i can't blame them you know people do the same thing here with the portable vibration calibrator that we manufacture they always send it back to us for recalibration and we are accredited for that but it even if we weren't people would send it back to us for recalibration because we're the experts on it and that you know that's that's part of the value proposition from the oems is um they are the experts on it they understand how to adjust it if it's off and um they can just duplicate the original calibration that they they performed on it so it's both it's both a curse and a blessing to not have a standard because you can look at your analyzer it gives you the freedom to look at your analyzer and calibrate it how you want to calibrate it you know specific to how you use it but at the same time it leaves open to interpretation the fact that there's no blueprint can certainly make it intimidating to calibrate the portable vibration analyzer so what are we actually doing when we calibrate a vibration analyzer are we calibrating or are we just validating well it kind of depends what you what you do calibration implies that an adjustment can be made to bring the device under test within tolerance versus a more accurate standard like for example the heart pressure transmitter can be trimmed or adjusted to be brought back within tolerance um that scale on the top right um that has a zero button on it somewhere i don't actually the reset button is the zero button whenever you press that button you you're calibrating it you're calibrating it with zero payload you're teaching the shaker what zero the scale rather what zero payload is and you're calibrating it so in the case of vibration analyzers when we calibrate the entire unit as a system accelerometer and analyzer which i'll show in a second if we make an adjustment to the input sensitivity of the vibration analyzer to match the output of the accelerometer then we're actually doing a calibration if we don't make any adjustments we're really just doing a validation and a validation is done uh when the the um unit under test is compared against a more accurate standard but is not adjusted and an example of that you know both of these things come into play in the in the vibration market piezoelectric accelerometers are generally uneconomical to adjust so in the world of vibration we actually use the word calibration all the time when we kind of mean validation but it's just so commonplace to say calibration here in the vibration world when an accelerometer comes in here for example to the modal shop we offer calibration services we don't say validation even though maybe that's the more accurate word because we're not going to open up the accelerometer and make any adjustments to it if it doesn't pass calibration or if it's off by whatever percentage three or four percent it's not like we can bring it back to to where it's dead on 10 millivolts or 100 millivolts per g that's just uneconomical to do so it's the terms are kind of interchangeable in the vibration market to open up a vibration sensor would involve obviously opening it up it's a hermetically sealed sensor in most cases so to open it up is difficult in itself and then the picture on the bottom right there is a tri shear design sensing element is located between those three masses that you see around the preload ring loosening of that ring is one of the primary reasons for signal drift but to get in there and actually make the modifications to bring the sensor within tolerance is uh generally uneconomical it's cheaper just to buy a replacement sensor so electrically testing a vibration analyzer would be an example of uh validation this is electrical analyzer calibration in a sense a function generator is used to simulate um the signal from an accelerometer and compare it to the measured vibration levels on the analyzer so um we'll use a function generator like that tektronix will measure the output independently using the agilent dvn that you see just below it depending how many channels we do we might use the whole stack of agilent dvms on the plus side electrical analyzer calibration can be accomplished with you don't need a shaker you just use a function generator or a simulator and the uncertainty is a lot lower because there's no mechanical motion the uncertainty of in general if you look at various scopes of accreditation the uncertainty of ac voltage dc voltage frequency measurement is much lower than the uncertainty of mechanical accelerometer calibration so there's no moving parts in this system which allows you to have a very low uncertainty of measurement where on a mechanical side you have to deal with distortion and transverse motion and things associated with that mechanical motion of the accelerometer also uh it allows so one of the cool things you can do with electrical analyzer calibration is actually simulate advanced vibration faults to test the processing algorithms for like a lot of vibration analyzers have stuff there's a lot of marketing terms out there like peak view or spike energy where they're going to do some advanced signal processing to try to pick up at an early stage bearing faults or gear mesh you know stuff that can be hidden in the overall vibration signal just pull that out of the fft separate it and present it to the user so that that's a really nice feature of a portable vibration analyzer you could actually test the accuracy of that methodology using electrical analyzer calibration you know that said you need to have a very thorough understanding of how that methodology is applied in order to do that and it doesn't help that the analyzer oems typically do not perform that type of testing but it would be really cool if they if they did on the downside the accelerometer is not tested so it's not a complete test of the measurement system you have to keep in mind that your accelerometer is um probably the weak point in the system it's the the element that's more likely to fail and it's the only part of the system that actually is touching the machine um you as i mentioned before it does take an understanding of how to correlate voltage to vibration amplitude like we calibrate uh contest that's a vendor i didn't mention yet we calibrate com test vibration analyzers here and we apply a voltage that's easy to convert to inches per second um we just pick a frequency it's 159.2 is the frequency at which um velocity intersects with uh acceleration so if you apply a signal at that frequency um it's a one-to-one conversion so let's say it's an analyzer set up for 100 millivolts per g um if i apply a 100 millivolt ac signal i'm applying 1g and if i do it at 159.2 hertz i'm also applying one inch per second so that's kind of how how it goes um and the final con is the analyzer adjustment most likely requires oem intervention or someone qualified to open up the analyzer and make an adjustment that said it's somewhat unlikely that the that the analyzer is going to require adjustment mechanical uh mechanical analyzer and accelerometer calibration involves using a shaker doesn't have to be the portable shaker table any shaker using a shaker with a known vibration amplitude to test the vibration analyzer by exciting the connected accelerometer and measuring the deviations and on the plus side it tests the accuracy of the accelerometer and analyzer as a system and it does allow for calibration or adjustment of the vibration analyzer to match the accelerometer's output and it can be a little bit more simple because if you have a shaker that gives you the scale of the amplitude vibra of vibration you can do the calibration in the same scale so you don't have to convert units or worry about what frequency you're at that all depends upon what shaker you use and what you use to measure the known vibration on the shaker itself um on the downside it uh uh you really you really can't well you can if you you could use like um you could use like a new shock or a shock tower something to generate really high frequency vibration signals from the accelerometer and then see if that applies to the advanced signal processing methodology it's just very difficult to do and it might take some specialized equipment depending upon how high you want to go and of course it has a higher uncertainty of calibration when you're doing a mechanical calibration why should the accelerometer be tested the these are some of the general traits of the accelerometers that are supplied with a portable vibration analyzer by the oem usually those sensors are only calibrated at 100 hertz but we use them throughout their frequency range but they're not calibrated throughout their frequency range it's a single point calibration which is not iso 16063 part 21 compliant typically the frequency response is plus or minus 3 db which converted to percentages is surprisingly high and low it's 41 percent high 37 percent low and you know the vendors they do that because it allows them to specify the highest frequency response it's a very competitive market so in general within the industrial market plus or minus 3db has become the standard when you're advertising an accelerometer you'll say oh it's good to 15 kilohertz plus or minus 3db where in the test market they they don't do that usually the sensors are good to 10 kilohertz plus or minus 10 or 5 percent 3db is not really used in the r d market as prevalently as it's used in industrial so it's sort of become a specimen ship thing um and like i said the accelerometer is not calibrated throughout its frequency range so you may you may be depending upon an accelerometer to make a measurement at a bearing fault frequency or gear mesh but it hasn't been calibrated anywhere near that frequency see i told you it's going to be hard for me to stay off my soapbox during the course of this presentation so you have to pay attention to the usable frequency response of the accelerometer and and and just be aware of what plus or minus 3db really means it's a small number because no one wants to see 41 percent high or 37 percent low so they use 3db they use it for marketing purposes and and you know the company i work for does the same thing sensing element on these sensors is ceramic ceramic elements are artificially polarized and they are more apt to drift over time than quartz some of the reasons you know and and i've had i've been doing this a long time uh 16 17 years i have used the emerson 2130 2140 i don't think i ever had a 2120 in my hands uh csi emerson rockwell ntc ird alan bradley whatever you want to call them i did some troubleshooting with the datapack 1500 before which is a real old one i've used a dash skf proof technic proof technique was interesting um i'll talk about that in a second i want to get off track and com test and the only analyzer where i was impressed with the accelerometer itself was actually a zima dli they had a triaxial accelerometer with a full frequency response suite calibration on all three axes which i i thought was fantastic that one kind of set itself apart otherwise uh in general you can expect 3db tolerance ceramic elements they're all ceramic even the azima dli one and uh just a single point calibration at 100 hertz this is um the skf that's just an example of what i'm talking about the cmxa80 is supplied with two ss 2200 side exit accelerometers so how do we look at this uh specification um first of all we see 100 millivolts per g sensitivity and we can see that the precision is plus or minus 10 percent usually this type of tolerance is going to immediately follow this number or be on the line directly below so for this accelerometer to pass calibration and and down here i blew these notes up these are kind of the fine print it's only calibrated they don't explicitly say it but it's only calibrated at 100 hertz so in order for this accelerometer to pass calibration it needs to be between 90 and 110 millivolts per g at 100 hertz it's not calibrated anywhere else in its frequency range and you can see they do give you the 10 range tolerance range to 5 kilohertz and the 3 db range to 10 000 hertz or 10 kilohertz so just an example of of what is typically supplied i don't mean to pick on skf i could have pulled up emerson and and given the same example um but uh you know usually it's going to have kind of a wider tolerance um you know of 10 or maybe even higher and it's a single point cal and then of course you have the uh 3 db range a little bit deceiving there so in the case of this transducer if you had a lot of skf analyzers you know technically hopefully this doesn't happen but technically if you had you know 10 analyzers and 10 sensors you might have some sensors that are closer to 90 millivolts per g you might have some sensors that are closer to 110 millivolts per g so if you interchange those sensors and maybe the last quarter you took data with a 90 millivolt per g accelerometer and then this quarter you're using something that's 105 millivolts per g you know your vibration trend automatically going to be 15 percent higher when if that's a scenario so it can be uh it can be tricky and and i you know if you're in the market for a vibration analyzer it might be in your best interest to to look for one that or just buy the accelerometer by itself or you can get one that's plus or minus five percent or something a little bit tighter okay so um that being said so the accelerometers got a pretty wide tolerance should i adjust my analyzer um that's a question i get all the time it it can be difficult um i want to say yes i mean in in the in the perfect scenario okay everyone would quickly run a sanity check at least on the accelerometer before they go out and they do um data acquisition and to do that you don't have to spend an arm and a leg you can you can get a simple handheld shaker like the one i have on the screen and if you want to use a separate power supply and a volt meter that battery powered signal conditioner is like 200 somewhere in that range actually that one specifically has gain but they have cheaper ones than that and you can excite the accelerometer at 1g at 159.2 hertz and just quickly get a sanity check on the sensitivity of the accelerometer before you go out and make uh vibration measurements should you change the setup that's i i can't really answer that question for you that kind of depends upon your program because there's there's pros and cons i mean if you take the time to program the exact sensitivity at 159.2 hertz of your accelerometer it's more accurate than not doing it but you have to remember that now that accelerometer and analyzer is paired are paired as a system so if people mix and match their accelerometers or they pair a different accelerometer now your system is going to be off so it i guess it would depend upon the tolerance of the sensors that you're using if everything that you have has a plus or minus at least a plus or minus five percent tolerance at reference frequency and remember that's only at reference frequency but for simplicity of the conversation we'll just say plus or minus five percent at reference frequency which is usually a hundred hertz if everything you have is five percent maybe it's not worth it um you know the worst case scenario you grab a sensor that's 95 and then the next time you grab a sensor that's 105. if you're using sensors that are 10 15 or 20 percent tolerance then i think there's more value in checking them before you before you go out and of course you can go out and acquire um for not too much money sensors that are um more accurate the you know not to to our own horn here but the the precision sensors that are made by pcb they advertise a five percent tolerance but when they make them they generally turn out a lot closer to 100 millivolts per g their the specification i would say is conservative because what happens is they they actually do a pre-calibration on those and so they'll put them on a shaker just at 100 hertz now i'm not saying they're going to do a full sweep precal but they will build the sensor try sheer design and then they'll tweak that design before they seal it up so that they have the best chance of being dead on 100 millivolts per g at reference frequency and then that also gives them the best chance of passing the calibration process throughout the frequency band so might want to think about if you acquire really good sensors you you have less to worry about here about adjusting your your vibration analyzer so um it can be a slippery slope i like it in theory but if if it's forgotten about and then someone goes to use that analyzer and it's set up for a 90 millivolt per g like in the picture i have it set up for 90 millivolts per g if i forget and i go and i use it with a more sensitive accelerometer then i'm not going to get good data so um you know there's there's a trade off there also not every analyzer can be adjusted i forgot to mention that that's where that proof technic analyzer comes into play i had the proof technic analyzer in my hands and in order to make an adjustment to the input sensitivity of the accelerometer i needed a special passcode that the my customer didn't have the code it seemed like they had to call the vendor to get it so i'm not 100 sure if they give you the code in the manual with proof technic or if you have to call them to get it or even if they will give it to you but not every analyzer is uh is adjustable from from my experience let's talk a bit about the uh mechanical uh comparison method before we uh sign off for the day so the mechanical method is uh using a shaker like you see in this picture we're shaking at 10 hertz so it's easy for everybody to see we're going to use a shaker to excite the accelerometer connected to the vibration analyzer and just use the comparison method to in this case we're shaking it 0.81 gs is the analyzer going to measure 0.81 g so that's that's what we're looking for in the uh the comparison method so it's it's really simple it's a one-to-one comparison um and in this method like i said and here's an example where we were shaking at 1.5 g's peak at 3 000 cycles per minute i was using a digital accelerometer in this case and i took the fft on the digital accelerometer and my peak was at 1.549 g's and it did occur at 3 000 cycles per minute so i had a little bit of error there which would be 1.549 minus 1.50 divided by the known of 1.50 essentially gives me my error in this cage which i should have done the math on but didn't do in advance this presentation it was a little high it was in the um that's in the 10 range as far as the error goes for this particular measurement um or close to it and then in here's another picture of the comparison method just using the emerson 2130 i'm shaking at 0.2 inches per second peak and at 30 hertz and it's kind of hard to see because the numbers are so small and to get this image on the slide um so it depends on your screen resolution but you can barely make it out amplitude in the bottom left of the analyzer itself was .197 inches per second so i was only off by .003 inches per second so this was very accurate and my frequency was 30 hertz so again 30 hertz was dead on versus my known that was coming from the shaker tape like i mentioned earlier there's a variety of ways to calibrate a vibration analyzer you could go for linearity um and no one's going to tell you that the um that you're doing it wrong or doing it right there's there's no standard like i said it's the wild west a little bit so this is just an analyzer example uh here in in linearity where we started down at 0.25 and we measured the linearity of the amplitude measurement uh holding the frequency that will be here and going all the way to to 3g's peak and then here's that that same data just broken out for accuracy so in this case it was very linear the entire time but my measured values were usually about two and a half percent higher than my known values so i have my known values here on the left i have the measured values here on the right and my deviations like i said that's that's measured minus known divided by known expressed as a percentage and so each of my measurements were about two per uh two and a half percent high as far as frequency goes um just this is just my experience very rarely very rarely is the frequency incorrect i seldom do i see any deviations on the frequency measurement on a vibration analyzer some people might have a different experience but that's just my own personal experience it tends to be right on so but you can measure of course the accuracy we depend upon accuracy of frequency response measurement in the analyzer so it's not a bad idea to test it i just think it's it's one of those things that's probably unlikely to fail your most likely inaccuracy is going to be on the the amplitude side of things this is my favorite way to express the data this is what i would recommend testing over the usable frequency band or your frequencies of interest and in this case i stopped at a thousand hertz you could go higher of course i was doing this in inches per second peak it was a little bit sloppy on my part i didn't note that in the uh the amplitude scale here which i should have done but you can only go so high with a shaker table in inches per second peak so i stopped at a thousand hertz um and in this case we just have the uh the measured amplitude here measured frequencies here and of course your knowns over here and it'll calculate the deviations um for amplitude and frequency on the right-hand side um i would would have loved to hold the amplitude at a half inch per second peak throughout these frequency response points um but the um shaker itself is is uh difficult it's difficult to stay in the scale of inches per second it's difficult to hold at 0.5 with a shaker the higher and higher you go the more stroke you need so it starts to become difficult to keep that at 0.5 inches per second whenever you do a vibration analyzer calibration i do recommend documenting the analyzer settings and your window type can of course affect your this isn't my field of expertise per se but the way it does the frequency response is in bins so your window type certainly affects the bins flat top window is probably the best one for pure calibration but i don't i'm not saying you should calibrate it in flat top if you're going to go out and use it in handing or hamming or something else you should calibrate the analyzer in the window that you intend to use it in but documenting the important thing is documenting the results is critical because if you if you happen to go out on a route and and take bad vibration data and you want to know you know it just gives you that documentation where you can compare the settings on the analyzer versus when it was calibrated that's that's kind of the key so be sure to document your your results and of course document your test equipment and this is very important for the accelerometer that's paired with the vibration analyzer in this case it was a csi triaxial accelerometer document the serial number the date that that one was calibrated the sensitivity at 100 hertz etc you know make sure that that information is documented on the calibration report and that way if someone happens to swap accelerometers and the data becomes strange you'll you'll have a record of what accelerometer was paired with the analyzer when you did the calibration the cheap plug here i mean all of the so all of the charts and graphs that you just saw in the last four slides they are supplied with the workbook that is supplied with our portable vibration calibrators a little bit of an advertisement here my apologies but the portable vibration calibrator does come with a workbook that allows you to create the linearity frequency response accuracy charts that you just saw in the last four slides and of course document settings and document the equipment that was used to calibrate the vibration analyzer we didn't do anything revolutionary per se we just uh i mean people have been performing system testing and calibrations on analyzers for a long time all we did was add a report kind of using our background in calibration we added a report that people could use to create their own calibration certificates and sort of remove that hurdle from the process like i want to do this but i don't know how to get started well the report helps you and we also have instructions in the manual but the report helps you to get started with the process if you're interested in taking this on on your own and and i'd like to point out that the portable vibration calibrators are available for rental as well i mean a lot of people only need to use these calibrators once a year i mean you might you use your analyzer every day but you use the calibrator once a year and you might calibrate the analyzer once a year so they are available for rental because you're only going to need to use it once a year if you're just calibrating an analyzer so it can be a big cost savings if you are maybe able to change that service contract or modify the service contract to save money there because running the calibrator is uh is very inexpensive okay i would encourage you um to uh watch our full-length video if you're interested in in how i calibrated the uh csi 2130 this video our website and it's on our youtube channel it's called field calibration of emerson csi 2130 vibration analyzer i go through the whole process of doing a um i guess i'd call it a frequency response calibration in the scale of inches per second peak okay wrapping up um this was our webinar series from the end of 2020. if you go to our youtube channel you can see the um uh all of these webinars are posted the the video recordings of each of these webinars are posted so we did uh we did um high temp turbine vibration sensors we did troubleshooting shutdown alarms we did noise exposure and noise does symmetry trying to go a little quickly here ground fault monitoring on brushless generators human vibration measurements and the importance of that last one i really enjoy the combustion dynamics pressure sensor calibration but we also talk about accelerometers in that one as well if you go to our youtube channel we have all of the webinars in playlists so you can click on playlists and you can see the whole series from the fall or winter time if you will of 2020 and the current series as well springtime 2021 for the industrial vibration market is up there this is the final uh webinar in the series like i mentioned earlier we did our digital accelerometer we did the calibration of differential charge uh we did liquid level measurements combustion dynamics pressure sensors wireless vibration and 4 to 20 and this is the final webinar in the series and again all of these webinars are on our youtube channel i hope you take a minute to check them out that was fun i i hope i didn't get on my high horse too much uh about some of the sensing technology that's supplied sort of by default with the analyzer oems or the service contracts i want to give people the option and and maybe show how analyzer cal can be accomplished in the inc shop or in the reliability department if the customer so chooses to do so the main goal so i want to thank everyone for taking the time to attend today's webinar i hope you enjoyed it hope you learned quite a bit and again if you would like to have us send you a certificate for continuing education please let us know we are happy to do that you'll get it right away

to be making red velvet peanut butter chocolate chip cookies and what we are going to do to start this recipe off is preheat oven to 350 degrees what still has another minute but while we are waiting we can get right to the recipe the dry ingredients the wet ingredients in the directions we need to take to master this recipe not mind you this is the first time ever making this but after user requests I decided why not let's give it a whirl first thing I'm going to do is take a half a cup of oatmeal or 40 grams and I get mine from my oatmeal com if you do not know about my oatmeal com 22 billion different combinations of oatmeal headed by a guy named Anthony and let me tell you some of the finest oatmeal you can get customizing to your liking customize it to your calories delicious flavors highly suggest it a link is in the comment box below for you to pick up some yourself so half a cup of oatmeal get it grind it up in the magic bullet or any kind of wonder that's going to be our first step now that our hope meal is grinded i'm going to take 8 grams of sugar free fat free jello pudding mix which adds good texture and moisture to the final product one scoop of core performance red velvet cake batter away which is 34 grams 60 grams or 1.5 servings of extra fluffy complete pancake mix i get this at walmart if you would like to use flour or any kind of other complete pancake mix perfectly fine a dash of sea salt to help with flavoring a dash of baking powder to help with overall baking in the final process making sure our cookies were eyes three grams or a little bit of Splenda which is about a quarter of a cup this will help sweeten the final product and give a good flavoring and that makes up all of our dry ingredients besides our peanut butter chocolate chips which I have right here which we will add and last on use 20 grams of these if you want to use regular chocolate chips by all means and with that said everything is right here my oatmeal is the last to add as you can see let's get to our wet ingredients I am going to use one whole egg cracked and throw it in there a dash of vanilla extract and one dannon light and fit greek yogurt I'm going to use the vanilla flavor so this does not take away from the red velvet flavor in the final product this is a 150 grams a little bit over 5.3 ounces so I'm going to take this spoon and drop it into my make all of our ingredients are together just going to take a hand mixer beat this on a low speed until your batter is complete place it in low speed and just mix it up until your batter forms a very thick batter and that will only take about a minute or so our batter is formed which is a very thick cake like batter like consistency we're going to take our peanut butter chocolate chips add them into the mix and just give them a swirl with a spoon okay that way they're two balls in the final product and now what we are going to do is take a baking sheet or a cookie sheet take some cooking spray and lightly coat the bottom to prevent sticking of the final product like so very simple we are going to take our spoon and get a nice little portion drop it on the sheet like so now when you place your cookies make sure you give them at least an inch inch and a half as far as space goes because they will expand in the cooking process so I'm going to rinse and repeat and separate these cookies so that way when they bake they are not overlapping and I'm going to do that for the rest of the red velvet peanut butter chocolate chip cake batter cookies toss them in the oven for about eight to ten minutes we're going to pull them out and show you our final product give you the rundown we'll go there right out of the oven and as you can see guys Rose very money's on the bottoms they are just a touch golden brown and very soft on the top what I would suggest is letting them sit for about five to ten minutes to cool before consuming or eating them for the whole recipe you can see here it's about 800 calories 15 grams of fat slightly over 110 grams of carbs and 60 grams of protein but if you break it down to per cookie it comes out through a little bit under

social media if there's somehow a way to make a keto pumpkin spice latte at starbucks but the answer is you actually you can't order a keto pumpkin spice latte at starbucks it's impossible because they use a pumpkin spice syrup to make the latte they actually don't use any real pumpkin or anything like that it's just a pre-made mix and there's no workaround to make that low carb or keto so having said that the best way to squash yes that's pun intended your pumpkin spice latte cravings is to actually make one in the comfort of your own home which i will show you how to make the best pumpkin spice latte recipe today this thing it's so good so flavorful just kind of like warms your body from the inside out and every cup of it has just over one net carb which i mean you know that's crazy for a pumpkin spice latte anyways with that said let's not waste any more time let's get right into it and i'll show you my low carb keto pumpkin spice latte recipe all right so the first thing we're going to do is get out our blender and add roughly 23 ounces or 720 milliliters of unsweetened vanilla almond milk to it then when we've got that in there we're gonna add one ounce or 30 milliliters of heavy cream to it now we're gonna add some of this stuff some pure pumpkin and this is not to be confused with pumpkin pie mix which has a ton of unnecessary sugar carbs and calories anyways we're gonna pop our can of pure pumpkin open then we're gonna add a heaping third of a cup or about 95 grams of it to our blender and if you're wondering if i just licked the pumpkin off my finger yes yes i did so once we've got that in there we're going to sweeten up our keto pumpkin spice latte without adding any carbs or calories by using some confectioner's swerve and for today's recipe we're going to add just less than a half a cup of it or about 60 to 70 grams depending on how sweet you want your pumpkin spice latte to be now after we've added our keto friendly sweetener we're also going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract along with a half a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice however if you don't have pumpkin pie spice or you can't find it at your grocery store you can always make your own all you have to do is mix one tablespoon of ground cinnamon with just less than a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and ground ginger as well as a heaping quarter teaspoon of ground cloves and boom bada-bing you just made yourself some homemade pumpkin pie spice anyways the last thing we're adding to our blender is a nice pinch of salt to really bring out the flavor in the latte and then as you're seeing here we're gonna grab the base of our blender as well as the top for it and then we're gonna blend or i guess i should say obliterate our ingredients until they're combined okay so once they've combined we're gonna pop our blender off of the base and add all that pumpkin spice deliciousness we just made into a small pot then we're gonna heat that on medium and whisk it occasionally until it just starts to boil once that happens we're gonna set our whisk aside and really take a second to appreciate all of the pumpkin spice aromatics coming from our pot it's good to do this not just for the body but for the soul then when we've taken all that deliciousness in we're gonna add six ounces or 177 milliliters of it to a measuring cup of course a typical pumpkin spice latte has a nice bit of foam to it so we're gonna use a frother to give our keto version an authentic feel as well then when we've got that looking good we're gonna set that aside and pour a shot of espresso into a coffee cup of course want to follow that up with the frothy milk that we just made and then we can stir those together add a little whipped cream and some more pumpkin spice to the top of our drink and that my friends is how to make a low-carb keto pumpkin spice latte as always for more info on today's recipe check out the video description below and i hope you enjoy it you", "0KptOpLZH4k": "hello my feet Oh bleeps its Amaya and welcome back to my youtube channel I don't sugarcoat today I'm so excited you guys I'm so so so so excited because I get to share with you guys a recipe that I have been wanting to share with people since the first time I made it and this is a recipe you guys that has changed the game of keto eating for me the last couple of months and mostly because I am using something that is brand new to me a wonderful new ingredient that I have been using it's not necessarily new it's been out there but I didn't know about it and I also noticed that not too many people seem to be using this ingredient as well so I can't wait to share it with you because it is a phenomenal product if you ask me okay so what is my new favorite ingredient you guys you guys I don't even know how to express how much I love this stuff and if you don't know what Lupin flour is I didn't know what it was two months ago either Lupin flour comes from Lupin beans and before you jump down my stuff about beans being a legume and a no-no for keto I know I know already but I want to say that we should accept that there are some great areas where kill is concerned and if you don't believe me let's bring up peanuts because although they have nut in their name they're not actually a nut peanuts are a legume as well but people want Ito because they are low in carbs and that is the same deal with Lupin flower blooming flower has a total of 12 carbs but 11 dietary fiber and that's just one people one net car / 1/4 of a cup and you don't even have to use that much of this stuff when you're cooking with it I incorporate it with other ingredients and other flours like almond flour and hashing flour and the stuff that I'm using here today so what are we making break guys good good keto break and before you sign or roll your eyes thinking to yourself oh not another keto video about bread wait hear me out because this bread if you ask me is the closest you're going to get to white bread and I'm serious I mean that this is not just me saying that because I have come up with this recipe that's not what it is at all I am being very serious with you I would not recommend anything that I personally do not love or do not eat myself so let's get started [Music] now I was inspired by another lady's recipe her name is Deidre she has a YouTube channel it's called Deidre's kitchen and I love this link because if it had not been for her in her recipe it might have taken me a long time to get to this point with my recipe so thank you Miss Deidre love you you guys check out her channel and you probably will love her bread recipe as well ours are very similar there's just a difference in ingredients okay let's get started for real all right so first you want to start off with adding one cup and a fork of vital wheat gluten you guys this is not wheat it does not contain wheat it's just gluten it's just a clue okay to that we want to add some oat fiber again this does not contain oats is just the fiber from the oats and this is a zero carb product zero net car and now for the star of the show I know it's not mine I didn't create okay and now we want to add I like to add three tablespoons of a sweetener because if you pay attention to most bread recipes or just the back of a label of store-bought friends they contain sugar so this isn't going to make it sweet or anything it's just going to make it taste more like regular bread now I would say you can play around with this and do anywhere between two and four tablespoons and you want to add some salt I'm using pink Himalayan salt this is just my teaspoon of salt [Music] okay and now we're going to add some xanthan gum this is a half a teaspoon of xanthan gum guys I'm still nervous okay so if you can tell that I'm so sorry because like this is still very new to me but I will get better as I make more videos but bear with me because okay now I like to take a whisk and whisk this all up get it all nice and coorporate it together so that way by the time we added into our wet ingredients all this stuff is nice and blended and everything is gonna come together nicely alright my daughter okay now when I work on our wet ingredients we're going to pata shwa more I really should have had her and now you want to let this water come down to I believe between a hundred and twenty-five to a hundred and thirty-one degrees and I'm just going to use a meat thermometer [Music] hold up that sitting there and watch this time and I'm actually going to just pause this while this water gets down to the temperature that we need and then we'll come right back and get started on the wet ingredients alright guys my water is now at a 131 degrees so we're going to go ahead and get accordance to my KitchenAid Bowl here and today I'm using this stand mixer because I just love using it for making bread if you don't have one you can still make this recipe um you'll just be happy to knead the dough by hand which will take a little more time but I know some people prefer to do it that way anyway alright to our hot water we want to add one tablespoon of instant yeast and now I'm going to add the paddle attachment and I'm just humming let that mix just a little bit so it gets incorporated into the water [Music] the nice smells rarely comes out at you once you start to mix it up you can really smell these okay and now I'm gonna do a step that you don't technically have to do and if you want to pass on this you totally can but I like to do it just kind of as a precaution so I'm going to be adding one teaspoon of honey and I know again honey is one of those things that you are not to consume on on keto but it is only one teaspoon and when you think about how many slices of bread you're going to end up with that's going to be somewhere between one car or less than one car per slice I mean so you can do it you cannot do it I'll leave that up to you [Music] all right and I'm going to let that get the nice little bits on it real quick okay now we want to add to room temperature lightly beaten eggs to the mix and in two tablespoons of room-temperature butter and we're going to let that mix up together and now here comes my favorite part adding the dry into the wet and you want to just go ahead and add it all in try not to spill okay attachment on and just go ahead and turn it on low and let it incorporate okay now something you'll notice when cooking with Lupin flour is it's a pretty it absorbs a lot of liquid and usually I find that I have to add more liquid than normal to recipes that I used to make prior to use a little bit loose and fun but with this bread recipe I didn't need to add any extra and I was surprised by that but it turns out great ok and now you want to go ahead and take the pilots panel off and I like to just use a spatula and just bring the dough together into a ball because it's going to make it easier once you put the dough clip on or to catch and start to spin it and you don't really need to scrape down the sides all that well because at its meeting its gonna scrape those and add them into the dough so you don't even worry about it okay so you put your dough attachment on make sure you lock it in place and now we're going to put this on to medium speed and we're going to let this go for eight minutes all right you guys it's done it's been eight minutes and our dough is ready to come out of here so let's get it off the hook and don't worry about if a little bit separates it's easy to put back into the ball of dough okay now you'll see you've got a nice stretchy good texture dope here all right now you can take this and go ahead and put it in one baking pan and then let it start to rise but what I like to do is I like to split this dough in half and make two lows because it makes two nice sized slopes so it's just your prep it's just your personal preference of what you want to do [Music] and I'm going to weigh them because I like to make sure that my macros are as close to accurate as possible so I'm going to weigh each one and get it as close to even as possible oh my god you guys is perfect they're both 1269 okay so now I'm just gonna mold my dough into the shape of a loaf of bread that's what I like to do just make it come out nice and creamy linearizes and then I'm gonna set it in the bottom [Music] and I just like to pull it and kind of tuck towards the bottom right here that way the top is nice and the next thing you want to do is you want to cover them with either a wet towel or um we want to cover them with a wet towel or not wet damp damp you guys not what it's kind of late so I'm a little tired okay so you want to cover them with a damp towel or you want to use some saran wrap that you spray with some cooking oil and I'm gonna do saran wrap today now I usually don't use the arrows I think I don't know but I usually don't use this canister or spray anymore and I forgot the reasons why it's bad for you but I'm out of the other stuff if you know the reason why using these types are bad for you go ahead and leave that in the comments below because I forgot all right now if I can have my assistant all right this is my daughter some more some more say hello to people she wants to get out of here okay and this is my favorite part [Music] because saran wrap doesn't like to behave I have to have someone holding it so I can spray it so I didn't get you I didn't I didn't you our promise may be a little bit and then you just want to lay it gently on top of there wait wait I got another one come on last one last one all right all right and now you can go you've been an amazing assistant okay and now we're just go away over this one and my kitchen is pretty warm right now guys so I'm going to leave this city mouth room-temperature unless these rides and one of them rice for about an hour to an hour and a half so they'll get a nice good rise on them but if your kitchen is kind of cold go ahead and do this method get a microwavable safe cup put some hot water in it stick it in your microwave turn it on for one minute so that way the microwave can get nice and warm and kind of humid with the water then put your bread pan in there and leave the water in there as well and you got to let it sit in there and rise so it's got a nice warm space but for me my kitchen is kind of warm right now so it's gonna stay right here and rise and we'll come back when they're ready to put in the oven all right guys welcome back it's been an hour and a half and look at our bread it looks amazing they look phenomenal they have risen so beautifully this is why I like to cut this dough into two because look it totally makes two and it also cuts down on the carbs per slice when you cut the loaf in half like this so now we're going to go ahead and take the plastic off Oh guys this is beautiful I mean this one has shaped a little bit better than that one but it makes them never mind because once they get in the oven one stick up guys they're going to you and when you smell your kitchen while these for cooking I'm telling you you're gonna think you have white bread in your oven that's what it reminds you of look at this like look it is phenomenal I swear it's great it looks great it's so great you guys look it's so great so what we want to do now is we want to put these in an oven that has been preheated to 375 degrees now you want to set your timer for about 10 minutes because something I noticed about this particular bread recipe is I believe it's because of the loop and flour it Browns really quickly so what I do is is after 10 minutes and it's got a nice golden brown I like to lay the sheet of aluminum foil over each one you don't want to put it on tightly you just gonna lay it over them so that way it'll stop browning and it can cook the addition to the additional seven minutes that it needs to cook to be completely done so set a timer check it after 10 days now it could be that my stove cooks a little bit faster than others maybe your stove will do the same thing maybe it won't but just to be safe such a time ten minutes check it and if you feel as though it's at the perfect color you want it covered if not you wait until it's at your desired color so I'm gonna go ahead and pop these in the oven and when they're ready I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna show you what these beauties look like once they're all done all right guys the bread is out it is done 17 minutes have passed and look you guys look at this it's so beautiful and if you have made this bread and you can smell what it smells like right now I bet you cannot wait to cut into one of these loaves and do something with it but right now these are steaming hot very hot and I'm gonna let these sit a little while so that way I can get him out of the pans and then I'm gonna get one sliced open for you so we're gonna take another little short break but it's gonna seem like an instant and I'm gonna come back and we're gonna go ahead and slice one open so you can see what the inside of one of these babies look like now I should say do not worry about your bread the flaming a little they're gonna do that that's natural for awkward and will deflate just a little but it will still be a wonderful loaf I'm telling you this is the best friend you've had on keto I promise you all right I'll see you in a minute hey guys I'm back and the bread has cold enough for me to be able to put and I'm going to be using this little gadget here for cutting bread I know that probably seems strange but I'm a little bit anal about symmetry I can't help it I like things to be geometrically symmetric so I'm gonna slice a few slices of the bread let you guys see with the inside looks like [Music] excuse the noise you can hear the only thing about this little doohickey is it doesn't like to be still [Music] [Music] [Music] okay let's see if I got it okay you guys can you see this look ice what did I say yes it's a little yellow on the inside because that's the color of the little bit flower but you guys look at that that is a slice of bread regular brain it's so soft it's so so tender it smells like bread I'm telling you you are going to be in love with this bread recipe you're not going to want to make any other time except for this one this is my name babe this is the one my husband likes I'm telling you it is fabulous now I do want to let you know that at the time that I'm shooting this video the actual brand that I use of Lupin flour is out of stock so hopefully it'll be back in stock by the time that I post this video and you guys can purchase some but if it's not in stock I will go ahead and leave a link for an alternative because I really want you guys to get going making this bread so you can see just how fantastic it is and once you guys have made it send me a picture in the comments if you can or let me

day after this uh outro because uh for\u00a0\u00a0 some reason i went to the gym and then suddenly i\u00a0\ndon't know my fibromyalgia or something just went\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely and i felt absolutely terrible for the\u00a0\nrest of the day i did now on the sofa i had that\u00a0\u00a0 stonking head a groggy head i just had no energy\u00a0\nand felt terrible so uh i'm doing it the day\u00a0\u00a0 after which is today now cause i'm recording\u00a0\nanyway yeah let's have a look at my macros\u00a0\u00a0 for the day and i'll just finish off the video\u00a0\nquickly yeah let's have a look right now check\u00a0\u00a0 it out then here is uh my daily macros and daily\u00a0\nfood as you can see here's a list of all my um\u00a0\u00a0 all my supplements i had and then yeah the the\u00a0\nbrie cheese the eggs and then the mango i had\u00a0\u00a0 before the gym all my workout stuff down up\u00a0\nhere the calories here the deficit on the side\u00a0\u00a0 obviously don't take that for like the exact\u00a0\nsciences it's just going to be used as an\u00a0\u00a0 estimation okay and these calculators are never\u00a0\n100 correct and then obviously the rest of the\u00a0\u00a0 food i had for today and as you can see i had\u00a0\na huge huge busy ass day so i burnt round about\u00a0\u00a0 three and a half thousand calories which is quite\u00a0\nquite high and uh only uh consumes around about 2\u00a0\u00a0 000 so yes quite a deficit here you don't normally\u00a0\nwant to be in this much of the deficit okay\u00a0\u00a0 probably 200 to 500 a day depending on your\u00a0\nsize but yeah do as i say you know what i do\u00a0\u00a0 so as you can see uh up here on the protein uh\u00a0\nor on the um calorie summary you've got the fats\u00a0\u00a0 at 49 protein at 33 and carbs 18. now i know what\u00a0\nyou're thinking those carbs are way too high for\u00a0\u00a0 keto but uh if we look down up here i got the\u00a0\num the mango right at the top which i had for\u00a0\u00a0 my pre-workout which is the 45 grams of carbs\u00a0\nand then after my workout i had that massive\u00a0\u00a0 salad so that was where the rest of the\u00a0\ncarbohydrates came in so don't worry about that\u00a0\u00a0 it's loads of fiber in there it's going to fill\u00a0\nyou up and you're going to be losing weight like\u00a0\u00a0 i say depends what you want to do keto 4 for the\u00a0\nwell-being or weight loss and then 130 grams of\u00a0\u00a0 fat not too much on the fat but you can get your\u00a0\nfat from your body sources so that's all right\u00a0\u00a0 and yeah there we go then that's pretty much\u00a0\nmy day then and as you can see uh 96 percent of\u00a0\u00a0 targets met protein slightly over but uh yeah not\u00a0\ntoo bad at all i'm not worried about that because\u00a0\u00a0 uh yeah done loads of exercise and yeah nice\u00a0\nthermogenic effect of protein so help you burn\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit more calories and then yeah here's\u00a0\nall my other sort of breakdown of the micros\u00a0\u00a0 and whatnot as you can see all the vitamins are\u00a0\nputting pretty much full up apart from a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit low on the vitamin e and then the minerals\u00a0\ndown here all pretty good as well apart from\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit low on the sodium there and um the\u00a0\ncalcium as well but yeah not too bad at all so\u00a0\u00a0 yeah you go then guys that's my macro breakdown\u00a0\nand what i had uh that day i hope you found it\u00a0\u00a0 entertaining and useful and informative and\u00a0\nall that malarkey and that's that's it

them and i've seen all the views and everything fantastic thank you so much i appreciate everyone that looks um the only thing i'm not saying is there's not many likes now either you just don't like me or you're forgetting to hit that little like button so can you make sure that when you watch the video down at the bottom it says like hit the like button because then that way that tells youtube that it was a good video and more people should see it and it'll go on higher up the list so other people get to see it when they search so yep please if you don't mind hit the like button that's really great because we had about over 150 views on one video and like six likes so it looks like sort of 144 people didn't like the video but then they didn't dislike it so anyway enough about that uh today we're coming to you we're going to do a couple of little keto treats one of them being a savory treat as in crackers and the other one being a more of a sweet treat which is just a real simple free ingredient peanut butter cookie type thing so i'll get all the ingredients together and i'll come back and show you what we've got so firstly with the crackers we're gonna have almond flour just plain old water ground flax seed make sure it's ground if you've got regular put it in the blender grind it up regular salt fine-ish and then more coarse salt you'll see why later on in the video as for the crackers for this side you've got the peanut butter you can use crunchy or smooth whichever you like half a cup of sugar and here is one whole egg and two egg yolks so i'm gonna get me mixy things ready and then i'll come back and we'll get them mixed up and we'll make a start okay um first of all we're to do the crackers um all of the measurements will be down in the description below uh i'm going to go for that now so start off with your almond flour let's put that one on that wax don't need that one add your salt your flax seed and your little drop of water and then literally just make this into like a kind of dough really um i've already i've already made a boo-boo peeps i should have actually mixed the flax seed and the almond flour together before adding the water because they would have combined easier before the water as you can see i've now got streaks of uh flaxseed but never mind it will mix up in the end okay as you see now we are all combined now rather than the nice streaky bits so from the bowl we get a piece of parchment get that out onto that like so smush it down a little bit and just simply roll it out nice and thinly because you're trying to make the consistency of a cracker roughly you want it to and we're actually going to leave it on the parchment because we're going to bake it like that on a sheet tray now that's going to go into the stove or into the oven sorry uh gas mark gas mark yeah 350 guess mark how old is that anyway 350 for about 25 minutes i think i'll have to check my paperwork but before you do that you want to cut it up now so start off cutting it down the middle and then middle again and sort of middle again and then middle again oops cool dui riddle again he's actually come out a little bit smaller than i did last time so it don't matter just means you can have a couple of them and with the the carb right in these you can eat i think it was about 10 of them yeah okay well i sort of really done that good dinner okay what you need now is something like uh something i don't have stay there look at that you know that'll do right now what you want to do is just go around each one just put like a little hole in it i'm whizzing through this now just for the benefit of the video so don't you do this you can take obviously a little bit more time and do it nice and neatly um when it does come to the time of cooking um last time i've done this the ones around the edges actually start um browning quicker so what you can do is actually go in and take them out and then put the middle ones back in again to finish off now this was what your your course salt was for and what you want to do is just lightly spread that all over the crackers because then you get a nice little salty crunch when you're munching on them okay once you've done that i think i'm going to use all of this just literally just give it a gentle pat to sort of put that salt into that okay i'm gonna go and get the uh the oven on and ready and throw this in and i'll be back in a little bit something a little amusing just move the egg bowl look at this look it's what you call happy treats okay right so as i said one whole egg two egg yolks um apparently um i'm gonna be rewind where the recipe comes from the another keto cook i'll put his details down in the bottom so you can look at his page as well he said apparently when they'd done just the one egg um they found that the treats were a little bit dry so they added two egg yolks which makes it better and probably the reason why it's dry is because it's organic no junk peanut butter rather than all the sugar and all the emulsifiers and other crap that you get in your normal peanut butter um that's probably why the peanut butter is a little bit drier so the egg yolk makes up for it so anyway let's get on to this right we've got got the eggs start breaking these up and then i'm going to just mix the sugar into that and get that mixed in first so the sugar sort of dissolves a little bit first again all of the uh all of the measurements will be down in the description once i've got that sugar combined enough then i'll get the uh the peanut butter in okay it's looking good now for the fun part actually i'm gonna dump the whisk because i think the whisk is gonna get too gummed up in with our peanut butter sure look at that let's get out of there the only funny thing is this peanut butter is when you look it in the jar you know it's good peanut butter because when you come to it all the oils on the top and all the peanuts are settled that means it's good peanut butter so all right let's get a lot of blobs of it get that away all right let's mix this up get this all nice and combined and then once i've got this combined what we're going to do is going to bang it in the fridge for about sort of 30 minutes just to um let it stiffen up which will be easier for you to make the little balls that we're gonna then end up baking in the oven so okay oven's up to temperature let's get these crackers in so i'm going to put these on a just over medium shelf and i was right on the time it is 20 to 25 minutes but keep an eye on it because like i said the edges will start going brown first because uh they're slightly thinner and as i said as they do go brown you can go in just take them ones off put them back in and finish off the middle bits so while that's doing our peanut butters going sort of solider or cooler however whatever you want to call it and once that's done we'll then get them all mixed up into little balls and put them onto our sheet tray so be back in a sec righty-o nice cool peanut butter so now this should be a little bit better to handle he says see this is for rehearsing right that's very oily okay easy way of doing this to get it into portions is ice cream scoop so get that pop that out pop that on your tray and then just basically do that with all of them just gives you a uniformed what should we call cookie just such so get these all spread out like that um just let you know the crackers are in the in the oven doing um what i'm gonna do sorry what i've done is about 10 15 minutes into the time of the cookie uh cookie cracker being done i actually just turned the tray sort of a quarter turn just so because i noticed i don't know what your stoves are like but i know it's sort of like two of the edges we're doing more than the opposite two edges so i'll just spun it around so that it would uh sort of be a little bit more even and uh as i can see now it does look like the edges are going a little brown so i'm gonna pull them in a second and maybe get out the uh the ones that have gone brown and then pop it back in and then by time they're done it should be ready for these to go in and we'll get them cooked up as well with these um you want to go about five or six minutes and then pull them again which i will show you but i'm just letting you know now in case i forget to show you um put them in about five or six minutes and get yourself a fork dip the water and just mush it down to give it a little pattern but again i'll show you that so okay let me get these over into the stove get the crackers out and we'll be back in a sec okay crackers done let's get them out and see what they look like forgive me they are not on a sheet tray because as you can see the peanut butter cookies are on a sheet tray oops look at them nice crispy and brown i'm going to set them to one side i'm going to put this down because it's getting hot i'm going to set them to one side let them cool and then we'll pick them all off and then you'll get a look at them we'll put them in a tub pop that over there to cool peanut butter's in remember uh just remember butter your um your tray slightly before they go on you shouldn't need to because the peanut butter is quite oily but just in case so they're going to go in for about five to six minutes and whilst we're here i just wanted to show you something that we've done the other night as an experiment we made some nice zesty lemon pound cake it's absolutely great and then the lemon zest drizzle on top that's going to be a future video people if you want put down in the comments we want to see the pound cake and the more people that put a comment in there about it the quicker i'll do a video on it so put it down in the comments and remember hit the like button nobody's hitting the like button i thought you liked it so i'm gonna let them go five or six minutes and then i'll come back with a full can do the pretty pattern that i said and we'll see how it goes from there okay um i've got something to confess i tried one anyway good thing with parchment paper they're all nice and cold now how easy was that so here's our crackers again and then all we do is just simply put them in a don't think so my lady do you well give me one oh then you have one thank you okay so right little keto cracker and see snaps and hmm you could use that for a dip some i know hummus cream cheese whatever you did whatever you normally dip your friends you like them yes i do okay so there you go people there's your little crackers little bits of salt on the top makes all the difference now i've got to do is like these from my daughter because she goes from like nobody's business so we're gonna obviously eat a couple more of them so they're lower so we can get the lid on uh put them to one side by which time hang on back up back up back up back up let's try now okay we're gonna pull we're going to pull these right now what i was saying drop a wall smoosh and smoosh okay simple as that smoosh and smoosh smoosh smoosh just gives it a bit of a pattern that's all well than just a blob of whatever i've done these before they come out quite well have a nice just like snacking on with a cup of coffee okay so now bang them back in the oven and they should be good in about five to six minutes alrighty then there you go back in five or six minutes bye okay it's been about another six or seven minutes depending on how thick you do yours or how much you mush them down you might need to adjust the time slightly more slightly less so let's pull them so i think we're ready to go you may also notice there's observant people of you i actually moved them off of the tray onto a rack and then put them back again because the oil that was running out of these was causing like a puddle and i didn't want them to go soggy so hopefully that was a good move i'll let you know um we're gonna leave these now let them cool down once they're cold i'll come back to you we'll have a little taste test and see what they were like we've already tasted the crackers we'll taste the little bickies and then see how it goes from there be back in a little while okay they're all cooled down in a little bowl ready for us remember as their um keto crackers we're now at the point of our keto would you call these peanut butter fat bombs is another name they call them but anyway let's have a try little crunchy peanut buttery um i think i'd like a little sweeter just touch um maybe you could also put some um healthy chocolate on the top a little bit just so it melts also if you need to be good with ice cream so camera lady you think okay uh this was a quick video just a couple of snacks for you guys to have something you can snack on i don't know because the one thing i found difficult with this diet is when you're specifically eating certain things it was hard for doing like little snacks and that so now you've got the crackers so you've got a savory snack you've got a little peanut butter treats you've got another tank also got some lemon cake in the background do your deal if i get 20 plus likes then i'll make the lemon cake next so hit the like button comment subscribe uh what else catch me over on my um what i'm calling i'll put it up here my uh instagram channel and hope everyone's staying safe staying healthy until next week later [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "4EXpnsLUsqg": "hello my keto peeps it's samaya and welcome back to my channel i don't sugarcoat today i'm going to show you guys how i make my his and her k brownie so let's get started before we begin today's video is sponsored by wholesome provision they're a company that specializes in keto friendly foods they're also located locally here in the us go on their website and check out their catalog of products you can also find some of their stuff on amazon two of which are my new faves and that's their lupin flower and their allulo sweetener blend i'll leave a link to their website in the description of this video now let's jump into this recipe all right we are going to begin this by mixing together our dry ingredients and that's going to start with one and a half tablespoons of lupin flour next i'm going to be adding in 1 tablespoon of oat fiber to this we'll add in 1 tablespoon of some coconut flour and then we're gonna add in one tablespoon of vital wheat gluten in here i have two tablespoons of some organic cocoa powder but you can also use cacao if you want it to be more of a dark chocolate flavor and now in here i have six tablespoons of the allulo sweetener blend and the reason why i'm using six tablespoons is because this is a two person serving so that's why there's so much sweetener in this but you can adjust it to however you want adjusted to your sweetness but this is a double serving and finally i'm going to be adding in 2 tablespoon i mean two teaspoons sorry two teaspoons of some baking powder a quarter um teaspoon of some xanthan gum um an eighth of a teaspoon of pink himalayan salt and an eighth of a teaspoon of some baking soda okay now we want to add in our wet ingredients in here i have five tablespoons of some non-dairy milk and you guys already know this is cashew milk that is my favorite but use whatever type of milk you prefer and to this i'm going to add two tablespoons of some grapeseed oil but you can also use like some avocado oil as well for today's video i'm going to be making this more like a cake like brownie i just really love the fluffy cake like texture and i'm gonna be doing that by adding two tablespoons of some yogurt and this is too good yogurt it's the vanilla flavor now if you don't want it to be cake-like and you want it to be more brownie-like then you can just totally skip this part right here also if you got to see the post that i put in my facebook group and on my instagram about this recipe the car count is going to be a little bit different than what i posted when i first made this recipe i made um a batch for four servings and i used one egg in that batch and now that i've broken this down to just two servings i'm still using one egg and i'm adding the yogurt so it's going to take the carb count up just a little bit from what you saw on there but you could not add the yogurt if you don't want to add it and if you want to split an egg in half you can totally go ahead and do that but i'm just gonna keep the one egg i have a half a teaspoon of vanilla i'm gonna toss in and i'm gonna give this a good mix you guys you know what i totally forgot to pre-mix every all my dry goods together so please do that before adding the wet ingredients i don't know where my head was just then make sure you pre mix your dry ingredients because that allows the all the other stuff to get a chance to get nice and evenly dispersed throughout like the xanthan gum and the um baking powder and soda and stuff so just remember to do that next time and this is going to be a nice thick batter okay and now i have in here 21 grams of some lily's chocolate chips and the reason why i measure this in grams is that's because that's what the package gives me so when i have packages like that that measuring grams that's when you usually see grams in my recipes and so i'm going to put most of that most of my chocolate chips in there but i'm going to leave some to put on top and so now you just want to fold this in and in case you're wondering why i've named this recipe his and her k brownie obviously this the k stands for keto but it's because it's a two serving size and it's meant to be something that you make and share with your significant other i don't know maybe you're having a date night you cook up a nice dinner maybe a couple steaks maybe a couple lobster tails i don't know something like that you have this nice beautiful dinner and you can just whip this up really quickly really easily and the best part about this recipe you guys you're totally gonna get to throw this in the microwave and even though i'm not really big on doing microwavable recipes i wanted to do i wanted to start doing some because i wanted to have some quick and easy stuff that you guys could make also sometimes i like some quick and easy stuff and so when i don't feel like making something that's going to take me an hour or so i wanted something like this okay so now what we want to do is we want to take this and we want to put this in the microwave for three minutes on high now depending on the power of your microwave depending on what what it is depends on how long it'll have to cook mine is a 1200 watt so i'm gonna make this for three minutes yours might be a little bit less so you might have to cook it longer and if yours is a little bit stronger you might have to cook it a little less so just be mindful of that so i'm going to go ahead and put this in and we'll come back and finish this up look at this it looks fantastic it rose up all nice and big and beautiful it looks absolutely delicious and it smells amazing so what i want to do now is i'm going to add some powdered sweetener to the top of this i'm just going to add just a little a nice little dusting to make it all nice and beautiful but you can dress this up however you please and then i'm going to add the rest of my chocolate chips right on top and because this is nice and warm these are going to get all nice and soft and melt into it it's going to be perfect now this is beautiful you can even top this with some whipped cream if you want you guys and it smells so darn delicious i i can't even describe the smell it's just wafting up it's so chocolatey so rich smelling so amazing so let's go ahead and just throw a little whipped cream on top i mean what the heck now that looks like fun that looks like a party you guys now i'm gonna go ahead and give this a quick taste for you guys oh it just goes into this cake brownie like just so smoothly like cutting into butter you guys oh my goodness i got chocolate on my finger here that is so delicious um about right there that is amazing i'm serious you guys can't go wrong with this cake brownie or if you just want to make it like a regular brownie you cannot go wrong this is a fabulous dish it's so soft look at that so soft so moist and it's so delicious if you eat it when it's warm i made another version of this brownie you guys a salted caramel one oh let me tell you that one is fantastic for those of you who are my patreon subscribers you guys will get to

"mw57eR1g_5s": "Hello Friend how are you? I'm Esbieta. Bread\nFrench that I bring you today for me has been a great revelation. Its very small size and its beautiful shape,\nits crust so crunchy and its crumb so fluffy make it a real treat. This bread, friends, eat like pipes\ndelicious that is. And I've known him thank you to you. Thanks to you have spoken to me\nof him, asking him to do it. And for them I am very grateful. The recipe is from Panera magazine, where they say\nwhich is a Peruvian bread although it is recognized the French influence. It is considered the\nbread of greater consumption at breakfast. And it does not surprise me because it's ideal for\nbreakfasts and even for snacks. East bread, friends, is a clear example that the\nshape and size influence taste. Everyone who makes bread at home in should\nTry this marvel, as an experiment. To prepare the French bread you will need\nthe next ingredients: 350 g of all-purpose wheat flour or flour\nof wheat with 10.5 - 11.5% proteins 8 g of salt\n8 g of butter 4 g fresh yeast or 1.4 g dry\n210 g of water 105 g of fermented dough Old mass 65 g of all-purpose wheat flour or flour\nof wheat with 10.5 - 11.5% proteins 40 g of water\n1 g of salt 1.5 g of fresh yeast or 0.5 g of dry If you do not know what old mass is, do not worry\nbecause it becomes very easy and in less than 1 minute.\nPut the yeast in a container. Add the water and stir. The water is about\n25-30\u00baC. You can use the yeast, both fresh and\nthe dry, the amounts are in the ingredients. Add the flour. Add the salt. Remove very well. Close the container and let it stand until\nthat goes up a little, about 30 min. Deflate the dough and store it in the fridge\nfrom 8 to 24 hours. I do it at night to use it the next day. Remove the old dough from the refrigerator. In a container put the yeast. Add the water of about 25 - 30\u00baC. Stir until the yeast is diluted. Sift the flour. Add the salt. Remove a little. Add the old mass. Finish making the ball with your hand. Add the butter and integrate it into the dough. Close the container and leave the dough at rest\nabout 20 minutes, so they get properly moistened the flour particles. Pour the dough on the table clean and dry\nand massage it until it becomes smooth, elastic and stop sticking to your hands. You can knead the dough in the mixer, they would be\n10 minutes in 2 speed. I've been slow to knead the dough for about 10 minutes. It is a very pleasant mass to the touch, very manageable\nand it's not sticky at all. A joy of mass. Put the dough in the container and let it rise\ndoubling its size. At 27\u00baC my mass took 45 minutes to rise.\nAt a lower temperature it will take longer to rise and vice versa. Roll the dough on the table and knead it\nminute. We are sorry Divide the dough into portions. Usually the\nportions are 40 g but I made them 55 g each. Make balls. Grab a cloth or a piece of cloth and sprinkle it\nwith flour. Form the loaves starting with the first ball\nwhat did you do. Put them on the cloth mouth low. Let them rise almost doubling their size. When 20 minutes are left to finish the levado\nturn on the oven at 250\u00baC with heat from above and below. At the bottom of the oven put a tray for\npour the water and create the steam. At 28\u00baC my rolls have been slow to rise\n35 minutes. At a lower temperature it will take more in uploading and vice versa. On a tray lined with baking paper\nplace the muffins face up. Put them in the oven. In the bottom tray, pour half a glass of\nboiling water. Bake rolls 18 - 20 minutes or until\nthat remain as you like. Remove the rolls from the oven. Place them on a rack to cool them down. I do not know what they usually eat in Peru,\nI would love that our Peruvian friends they will tell us, but I have eaten them so much\nwith salty things as with sweets and superbly. Tell me in the comments what you think\nthe recipe. And, if you liked it, share it in social networks with your friends.

Until next time.", "8Scu1su2OcI": "hi guys so how have you been in MCO so a path problem maybe also trying out cutting hair and washing up your car one of the things you have done so today let's go back to the topic of cars and I thought since we are in a long time period so why don't we talk a little bit about the the different different brands as Malaysia so today to Brenda I'll be talking about Sachi about oh you're done so to attend where were they previously leisure I think before not really came up and took the title or non national number one title that was there and previously I think that cars to be honest doesn't look really then great and last time when he passed me whether you should buy it or that car no you know I always tell them it doesn't drive good you know the only thing can depend on is they are reliability so like even my mom might tell her and all the car isn't really his thing is degree okay but no the older generation they tend to think the client is very dependable which is very true so there was a reasonable goodbye mainly for the reliability result okay but what about the return now I mean I mean has been some time since then my real experience with it was with the first generation of yours so until today we have a lot of generation of years now and currently of course they are not doing so good in terms of sales if you really look into the numbers they are probably sitting around number four if we could the National may be number two if we don't include no brands in there so but what about the design of the cons I actually think that design is getting better and better I prefer it globally also their design starting to look so much better and I started a little bit and and I think that that design can just just did the design that hits this the right sponsor okay really lovely looking cars sporty aggressive and of course the new tnj platform okay which is rumored to be to drive very well I haven't really couldn't test it out very much myself I've only tested the Camry but new Corolla how I don't have a chance yet to go and try out and now that we're in the MCO well you should not go out right so prepare to go and try out late and let you know what's my impression of that car and of course the direction of the company is actually going towards a driver's kind of car so for me there is a very good direction okay because I'm doing a good drivers car is where you can increase actually the safety because the car is very much out of the driveway is very much in human with the cars control and it tries well you know you don't have issues of like you know rolling or skidding and it's kind of even due to loss of control less a chance I would say no chance but lesser chance okay and of course the the newer cars also they have beauty with greater quality doesn't feel as empty as the olden days that are now anymore so if you ask me what's my impression of the bar right now I would absolutely recommend their products okay it's a very very good products that they have right now making right now and then what is so special about Toyota well I've always had this time in my mind Toyota is a brand that the rest of the automotive industry to respect heavily okay I think actually they do but it's just my opinion why I think so is because if you're really looking with the global sales volume totai somewhere in the top three region okay the other two major players right now I think is the Volkswagen Group and of course the Alliance okay Brando me son mr. Bashir Lyons okay but if you look at it the number of brands in sight okay Volkswagen has about 12 the Alliance has about around 10 okay including some brands that probably you have never heard of because the brands are mainly based in you Eastern Europe in Lana - yeah its current brand yeah what's going on of course you have a lot of famous brands including I think all the heavy-duty trucks like Scania you know things like that but the to meet our brand if you look at it they only have about I think four to five brands under the whole group so that makes think about it the brands have to sell one brand in the other group had to sell even more than the Volkswagen just to you know to make them to be their top three so I think this that is something is own that's crazy from Toyota and I I think that is actually McDo does something about how powerhouse as well of course nobody said that I not powerhouse but that is one each meeting that they are one of the really true powerhouse of day one brand able to sound that many volume you know to fight me the maca leaders know that is crazy okay so there's gonna be a very short video so do you agree with my views on the total brain itself well if you like it give me a like if you don't like feel free news just click the dislike but whatever you do just give me a subscribe you know Shelley video with your friends and family do

"-HfC7AkYr9w": "hi I'm looking at Benny's diet in the kitchen my name is Kenneth Ultima and this week's episode we're going to go back to Matt's skin we're going to make an ant a lot of I know I've made an actual ID chicken recipe in the past but we're going to get home make the enchilada sauce this time and we're going to put that over top of faux Spanish rice so come along with me and we'll start just making it up all right so I've added one and a half tablespoons of oil to the pot and one small onion we're gonna cook these out onions up until they're translucent and tender in this back pot that in this back frying pan I'm going to add about two tablespoons of oil as well and add some colourful cauliflower that I pre shredded up in my food processor it's been minced to look a lot like rice I did it with the shredding blade as well as the chopping blade at the same time now we're going to cook this on the back pot until the Kaipara gets dried out and you can we'll catch back up at that point see you then guys okay so you can see the onions are getting slightly Brown and I've turned my colleague Halloran back to a low heat because I don't need it for quite quite yep so I'm going to add about three cloves of garlic I'm using that scarlet to this I'm going to add three tablespoons of chili powder two teaspoons of cumin two teaspoons of coriander half a teaspoon of salt give this a good quick mess so the spices can start blooming in the onion and the oils that are in there all right really start to smell the spices and there are essential oils coming off do this I'm adding a 15-ounce can of Huntz tomato sauce again in check for the ones that do not have sugar on the label there are some out there obviously hunts of a major name-brand does not have I'm going to add about 1/4 of a cup of water just to thin it out a little bit and further help the spices to mince in in the back pan well this is busy simmering for the next eight minutes we're gonna start heating up our chicken the chicken is just taken right off a rotisserie chicken that I got from the local grocery store and I just broke it up into little pieces to aid in cooking all right and we'll give this the cauliflower one quick stir turn down that to a low heat and we should be ready to be about eight minutes to put it all together and you'll see the finished product hey realized I guess I missed one key ingredient I need to add three teaspoons of Splenda into the mince or I'm doing the liquid equivalent three drops of liquid Splenda so like I said we'll be waiting for this to finish up in about eight minutes and we should be good to go at that point took two guys in but okay welcome back while you guys were gone I put one cup of the enchilada sauce over top the cauliflower rice to make it that rich red color that it is now the sauce is further reduced down to a very thick rich sauce and the chicken in the back pan is fully heated up into heated all the way through so we're gonna take one cup of the sauce and layer it over the chicken we'll turn down the chicken to about of to will simmer for two minutes and we're going to later layer on top of a bed of the full of Spanish rice I'll show you the finished product thank you guys for watching and have a good day all right you", "0lPUyqJ4HC8": "20:19 toyota yaris whether you're interested in the five-door or

you are new here hi welcome my name is Melissa and today I have a what I eat in a day video for you guys but first off I just want to say I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during these crazy times right now but while we are all sort of you know quarantined and stuck to our homes I wanted to share with you guys a bunch of what I in a day videos so I'm going to be sharing quite a few in the upcoming you know weeks or month that I want to know I don't know we'll see how long this goes on for so anyways today as I said everything will be vegan and keto I've been doing the vegan keto diet for over a year now I have a whole playlist I'll leave a link to right above here for you guys you guys can check that out so let's get into today's full day of eating vegan keto all right so we're gonna start with breakfast of course so for today's breakfast I'm going to be using visa Guardian breakfast sausage patties these are so good I absolutely love them there is a little bit of some maple syrup and some sugar in them but when I do scan them on my carb manager app it did say it was a grade-a because the card manager app will give you like a grade of how good it is to have when you are on the keto diet so I highly recommend that app it is a free app and I'll sponsored or anything here's the macros for it one patty is only 60 calories you got some 303 grams of fat the carbs are three net carbs because I always subtract the you know the fiber from the from the regular carbs and what I did was I just stuck them in my airfryer I could cook them up for about like six minutes then I also made some coffee filled a water bottle of course always gotta have that water I'm gonna use this harvest false harvest blend coffee I have a stockpile of this I had gotten it at the end of after the fall season I should say on clearance at Walmart I have a whole plate I have a whole eye clearance Walmart playlist I think I'll leave that linked above here for you guys so I'm also gonna add some of this silk dairy-free heavy whipping cream this stuff is so good it's zero net carbs the calories are a little bit high for one tablespoon but you know on keto you know you want all those you know don't worry too much about the calories because it will all work out once you add up your net carbs and everything and you have some good fats as well so there is my coffee all brewed you're gonna add about three tablespoons of the creamer then I'm gonna add a little bit of some of this Jordans skinny syrups you know I know the stuff is debatable on what how good it is but I love my coffee a little bit sweet this is the maple bourbon pecan so good so I'm gonna add a little bit of that as well and then we're gonna just blend it up and by that time my sausages will be all ready to go and out of the airfryer do you guys have an air fryer I absolutely love mine I got it right I got it for Christmas as a it was one of my Christmas gifts yes I love kitchen appliances for a Christmas gift or any kind or any time of day it's started for the beeping I know I'm on the computers you might guys might hear some beeping in the background sorry anyways my sausages are all ready to go as you can see they crisped up nice and you know nice and crispy and good but you can also put these in the microwave they are microwavable and then for some extra fats I'm gonna throw on some of this Country Crock plant butter I love this this has been my go-to vegan butter lately they have it with avocado oil olive oil and almond oil as well but I really love the avocado oil one so this will give me some extra fats because on keto you want to have those you want to make sure your fats you know have a good amount of fats throughout the day that will you know it sounds contradictory but it will help you lose the weight so here is breakfast today we've got two sausage patties we've got the coffee about a tablespoon of that Country Crock vegan butter and this is going to be how I'm gonna start my day and then a little while we're gonna go out for a walk beautiful walk is is it was a beautiful day this day so we're gonna get a walk in and then we will be back later for lunch [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you alright guys so after my beautiful walk today it was absolutely gorgeous out as you could see I walked for about two and a half hours I did a little bit of running I've been incorporating some sprinting as well so it was just so beautiful so it's like two and a half hours so what I'm going to do now is make a smoothie I've been loving this new smoothie mix from Sun warrior this is the plant-based clean keto one that they came out with I think a few months ago and the macros on this are really great it is you get two you can use two scoops sometimes I use one scoop so two scoops of it is only like three yeah three net carbs you get some MCT oils in there as well as you can see there are the ingredients you get a lot of great great nutrition out of this one I have a lot of different favorites but this is my current one I'm also gonna use some of this good karma flax milk this is about one net carb for a cup which is about what I'm going to use always make sure you get the unsweetened when you are buying your milks if you do follow a keto diet or a low carb diet because you don't want to have all those added sugars and you can still get a lot of the benefits and you know and it still tastes just as good you know I find some of the sweet those the sweetened milks are just a little too sweet for me so I'm going to add a cup of that and then I'm going to for a little extra like iron and magnesium I'm gonna add some of this cocoa powder from Trader Joe's it's the unsweetened as well I'm going to do a tablespoon of this as well this is only ten calories and it is only one net carb because you can see there the total carb is three fiber is two so you're getting one net carb and like I said a little bit of some magnesium and iron as well and then I had some frozen some spinach that I had kept in the freezer I'm gonna use a little bit of this as well it's probably gonna not even probably be like a quarter of a net carb in there I'm just gonna add a little bit just to you know make the smoothie a little bit thicker and just add some extra nutrition so like said going to do with the cup and then we're just going to add our smoothie mix and our cocoa powder and we're just going to blend this up and it will be ready to drink so it's been about four hours and so hats inside my smoothie so I'm gonna start preparing my dinner so for dinner tonight I'm going to make these beautiful asparagus I got these and one of my recent grocery hauls from shop I had them like $0.99 of pounds I'm gonna cook all of these not gonna eat all of them tonight but you know I like to when I make something make a bunch of it so we're gonna get these cleaned up what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put these in a bowl with some vinegar white vinegar and water mixture if you're not familiar with that I show it a lot of some of my meal prep videos how I wash my produce I also just cut the bottoms of the asparagus as well they see just to snap it so you know where to cut it but I usually just cut it right below the rubber band and then I said put them in the bowl with some water and vinegar let them sit for me like 10 15 minutes and then what I did was I just kind of patted them dry a little bit and then I laid them on a baking sheet and put some slabs of this the Country Crock plant-based butter which I love so much because we got to get those fats in there when we are following a keto diet so there was so much asparagus so what I did was I put it on two baking sheets like I said laid it out sort of you know a single layer as much as possible and use that you know that vegan butter I did a little bit of some white peppercorns which I recently found these at Big Lots which I was so shocked to find them because I find when I was looking for them online one time they were quite expensive and then some sea salt as well just sprinkled that pretty basic you know you can you know other seasonings if you'd like but I just kept it pretty simple gonna toss these in the oven let them cook until they get kind of get brown and crispy and this is what they're gonna look like when they come out and they're so good I love the way the ends get like nice and crispy and like very tender and this is going to you know give me some veggies for several days so then what I'm going to do to have along with this is I'm going to have some Bokke turkey Berg turkey burger um and if you can see right now I'm doing air quotes because not necessarily turkey goes it's vegan but I'm gonna use the Boca turkey burgers and this is what the packaging looks like I bought the big box of them because we had just started our you know I guess you could call it our quarantine so I wanted to make sure we were stocked up on these items these are vegan be just be careful not all the Boca items are vegan so just be aware of that here are the nutritional facts in case you are interested there is a little bit of wheat you know I do try to stay away from we as much as possible but sometimes you know kind of gets you know it gets a little sneaky great ingredient and it gets in there but a little bit is okay the carbs on these are only two net carbs per burger and then what I'm gonna do is when everything is done I'm gonna drizzle some of this MCT oil on the top as well and here is my finished dinner and then I also forgot to mention I put some so I ended up making two burgers so that was only four net carbs and then I had a little bit of some diet cheddar cheese I put a little bit of that melted on top and then I added more butter on that asparagus because I just wanted to make sure I had enough fats in for the day because when I entered everything into my car manager my fats were still a little bit low so I just wanted to make sure that was why another reason I added some of the MCT oil you know you don't always have to drink the MCT oil you can also drizzle it on your food and this was my dinner for this evening so for tonight I felt like having a little bit of a decadent little treat I don't always do this I'm more of a savory eater rather than a sweet sweets person but I felt like having something a little bit decadent and I loved this silk dairy-free whipping cream like I know I've said this is several times on my channel and and you saw I had it this morning as well but I'm gonna going to make this into a whipping cream and this stuff whips up so easily so quickly within like two minutes you can whip this up by hand you can use a hand blender as well if you would do a bigger amount and then I'm gonna use some of this this hot cocoa mix I got this in my Fit snack box and this is very keto friendly it does say it's good for diabetics as well it has 12 carbs but 11 grams of fiber so it for two tablespoons it's only one net carb I think I'm only going to use about one tablespoon of it just to give my whipped cream this like you know a little bit of chocolate flavor it's gonna basically be a chocolate mousse so there's the whipped cream and then basically I just whipped it up by hand with a little you know a little tiny hand whisk and it only took about like I said not even like two minutes and I got a nice thick cream then I just added a tablespoon of that cocoa mix and just mixed that up in there and I had a yummy delicious chocolate okay so I hope you enjoyed checking out what I ate for a full day of vegan keto I am also gonna leave all my my carbs and my fat and protein all my macros you know for the day right here up on the screen so you guys can check it out and also how many steps I did for the day I think it was like well over 21 thousand steps I'm trying to use my time while wisely while while we are all sort of stuck at home during this you know a little bit of craziness that is going on in the world right now but anyways if you guys enjoy this I would love for you guys to give this video a thumbs up it helps me know that you enjoy them also helps YouTube

Today I want to share a Cantonese dim sum which is called Cha Siu Bao Sweet and sour flavor is really lovely I will share from the scratch like how to make ChaSiu (Barbecue pork ) the fillings and the dough of the bun as well. I hope you all like my version Correct me if I pronounce in a wrong way I would like to know what kinds of dim sum you like Please share with in the comment down below For the filling , we need to marinate the pork shoulder  a night before we make the bun Pork shoulder has a perfect combination of fat and lean meat     Stick some holes with a toothpick in order to marinate and cook For the sauce part,  I use some Chasiu sauce Oyster sauce and a bit dark soy sauce All the ingredients are listed down below the info box. please check     If you do not have Chasiu sauce on hand you can make it at home,  based on many recipes online Then we need to massage the meat to make it soak the sauce besides,  I need some leek Ginger slices and chopped garlic for the marinating sauce Then put a lid on the container Put it into the refrigerator compartment Now Let's make the starch that will be used in the filling Pan-fried some chopped onion leek and red pepper until the onions and leek become a bit caramelized Then add the sauce prepared before bring to a boil, then turn off the heat sift through the sauce remove the onions ,leek and pepper What we need is the juice only Then pour the juice into the pan pour the starch prepared before keep stirring while pouring then turn on the low heat keep stirring until like this, a bit sticky then add some canola oil to make it brighter then transfer it to a bowl wrap well put into the refrigerator compartment until it becomes like solid jelly I make this also a night before I make the bun to save some time Now the pork has been marinated for 3 hours Take the leek out As the leek would be stinky if marinated too long The pork needs to be marinated for about 24hrs If possible, you can flip over every 6-7 hrs A day later Remove the garlic and ginger Then put the pork into pre-heated oven 200\u2103\uff0cbake 15 minutes first during this time, let's make some mixture to brush on the surface of the pork   a tbsp of honey with a tbsp of water I also add a tsp of ginger juice to balance the sweetness of the pork   It's really nice I recommend you try this way after 15minutes, take out the pork, brush the honey water around the surface then put back into the oven 200\u2103\uff0c bake for another 5 minutes Then repeat brushing the mixture bake another 5 minutes For the filling Chop t  the pork into small pieces Take out the starch we made yesterday Mix them together For the dough, we need some cake flour   dry yeast baking powder granulated sugar and water put all of the ingredients into a stand mixer beat 10-15 minutes on medium speed wrap the dough well Let it sit for about 20 minutes then take the dough out spread into a rectangle shape then fold and spread twice after these steps   roll it divide the dough evenly into 7 pieces Press it and spread to a round shape Please make it thicker in the center, a bit thinner around the edges You can wrap it your way   or simplify like what I do         Please do not press too tight after they are done put them in the steaming drawer put the lid on Let them sit for about 40 minutes I cut a benz logo shape with the scissor So it would be blooming when steaming   Then put on the drawer on boiling water Steam about 10 minutes on high heat Then Chasiubao is done This is a simplified version So that you can easily make at home   You can try sometime I hope you like the video Please thumbs up if you like it Until next time Bye", "IBl2EE_wbVk": "oh scar no people man this is your butt levi yes i'm back in the building man got another uh y'all see it man him

Nikolas Lucca and dr. period powers the idea of doing this webinar is because the 19 California Building Code sought revise the side coefficients and as you know these side coefficients are not that reliable the soil class becomes looser or softer and the ground motion becomes stronger so a solution for this problem to this issue it is proposed to do site-specific emotion for several cases with some exceptions especially for example for cyclists II and almost all California now requires to do such specific in seismic hazard evaluation we understand that a long term solution will be will be introduced in the next cycle of the AC center but for now we have to deal with is how to do site-specific motions back in Monaco in San Diego we organized a one-day short course with the same speakers up today's webinar was well attended and I think Nico and Peter gained a lot of experience also they had got some feedback from attendees and now they are improving some things you know especially in terms of presentation of the tools so using these USGS tools geotechnical earthquake engineering community in California can do the site-specific seismic hazard evaluation so Nicolas Luca is a research structural engineer with the jewel two years in Golden Colorado and he serves as a liaison between the USGS national seismic hazard mapping project and the American Society of Civil Engineers as mix up committees for the ASC seven and forty-one standards before joining us years in 2004 he was a senior analysis engineer with the catastrophe risk modeling company a I our worldwide corporation he kalki PhD and be a bachelor degrees in civil and structural engineering engineering and Masters of Science in statistic from Stanford and his master's in civil and structure engineering from UC Berkeley the other presenter is dr.

you serve three he now developed software and tools to support updates to USGS national hazard models are related research so now I need the proof hello this is Nicolas Lucca or Nikko a short research structural engineer my colleague Pierre powers is a research and development geophysicist with the US Geological Survey in Golden Colorado before I started I'd like to thank you for arranging this webinar and in particular think ask Peter and I had to give a short course in for eg I San Diego last August that sure course have all been to this webinar as you can see the title of the presentation is yours just web tools for site-specific ground motion hazard analysis site-specific is in quotes because a terminology use used in a lot of different ways let subscribe the next slide so one make sure it's clear who what types of site-specific analyses were covering in this webinar versus not so let me start with what we are covering if you're doing it's like specific analysis because you're interested in specified that is not a reference iCLASS or specify the venus 30 or if you're interested in specified or numerous spectral periods for your ground motion hazard analysis we're interested in specified base and depths or specified rather than spatially interpolated and the crab motion hazard has a results for your particular location these are all things that will be covered in this webinar not not addressed sites for response analysis it just really doesn't have at this time any drills for site response analysis the other aspect we won't cover is the jewel that yes just does have and as HMP has you see there won't cover in this webinar how you could change the USGS hazard model for the nation via that software that that can be a separate webinar so with this understanding of what types of site-specific analyses will be covering when they go through line we'll start with a few slides of motivation several slides talking about the ASC 716 site-specific crown motion procedures with us just web tools for the probabilistic part of those procedures and probabilistic crap motions go to the unified Hazard tool over hazard curves the risk targeted ground motion calculator for risk targeting ground motions then we'll talk about the USGS web tools for deterministic ground motions that are also part of the ASC 716 procedures specifically we will talk about this building seismic safety council 2014 scenario catalog for a quote unquote characteristic earthquakes and the response units just respond spectacle for 84th percentile ground motions lastly a little bit about the u.s. just web service for the 2020 her provisions ASC 722 it's obviously coming in the future but it could be useful there as well summarize with a recap of all the the tools so start with motivation the primary motivation for this webinar is the 2019 California Building Code which references ASC 716 the design loads and associated criteria for buildings and other structures chapter 11 of ASC 716 which we imagine most of you are familiar with provides the seismic design current area and so 11.4 provides the ground motions as mcgraw motion values dropping down further section one point four point four is where the risk targeted maximum considered earthquake spectrum explants acceleration parameters are defined as you seen the equations here where that's SMS one or the ground motions from the maps and AC 716 and FA and F V our site the site coefficients to reflect local conditions fa f v sy coefficients provided table is like you see here for absolute Vee this is pulled directly from supplement one of ASC 716 so the highlighting you see here shows the differences with respect to the original version of ASC 716 it's really motivating interested in site specific motion hazard these two rows of this table for psych class where you see site coefficients but you also see a footnote that says see requirements for site specific ground motions in Section 11 point for point looking at that section eleven point four point eight describes the requirements for site-specific ground motions the first time is here essentially a specific is required for sy class F sites with some exceptions and following that importantly for us there's a crown version hazard analysis shall be performed in accordance with section twenty one point two there's a chapter twenty one that we'll talk about later for these following cases the first being seismically isolated structures and structures with damping systems if it's high enough hazard on the second side Class E sides with [Music] importantly the third one structures on sigh Class D which is quite common sight glass and also these sites where s 1 is greater than or equal to two point two so someone high hazard but this requirement kicks in quite often as you'll see there are exceptions to these requirements as you see at the bottom there I'm not going to go through those in detail in part because at least the wording of those exceptions is being improved in pending supplement three of ASV 7/16 so where does this third requirement for psych class deep East sites kick in those where is s 1 greater than or equal to point two so you can look at the best one map into a 7/16 a part of which is shown here it's difficult to follow the contours for point 2 G so here's the map just simple map that shows where s 1 is greater than or equal to point 2 G so as you can see most of California West Coast but also places in Nevada you know Salt Lake City area and the Madrid Seismic zone in Charleston South Carolina so there are quite a few places where these site specific requirements for cyclists D and E apply but this motivation for her USGS web tools for site-specific crime ocean hazard analysis let's talk through the ASE 7:16 site-specific rat motion procedures themselves these site-specific crab motion procedures for seismic design in Annecy 7:16 are in its chapter 21 the first section of that chapter covers site response analysis but the sexy second section that talks about grand motion hazard analysis for computing these risk targeted maximum considered earthquake RMC sub are ground motions section twenty one point two point three there defines the MCS of emotions as plethora of spectral observations from probabilistic ground motions and deterministic Ram motions so talk through how these two different types of ground motions I'm going to show you a lot of text because I think it's important to see these specifications section twenty one point two point one here for the publicity ground motions it talks about the grab motions being for the direction of maximum horizontal response which will be later slides also these ground motions are expected to achieve this one percent probability of collapse within a 50-year period so there the risk targeted part of these probabilistic ground motions there are two massive methods for determining these probabilistic ground motions the first method allows the user to calculate uniform hazard spectral accelerations like two percent and fifty you hear ground motions like was done before ASD 710 and apply a risk coefficient to approximate public risk targeted ground motions the approximation comes from the fact that these risk coefficients that are in mapped in ASC 716 were calculated for a reference site condition and could be different for the site conditions of interest so this method one actually the plan is to remove this from ASC 722 and just in favor of method two which tells you that the probabilistic ground motions are computed German from iterative integration from a site specific hazard curve with a log normal probability density function representing the collapse fragility so those very concise and precise wording not particularly helpful it's a wool we'll talk a little bit more about this method to and the USGS tool for applying it the deterministic ground motion part of the site specific procedure ASC 716 to find the section 21 point-to-point you they'll be calculated as 84th percentile 5% games fredrik spots accelerations in the direction of maximum horizontal response so 84th percentile ground motions again max Direction ground motions like the probabilistic and you calculate these 84th percentile ground motions for quote unquote curve to characteristic earthquakes on all known active faults within a region of interest and with the largest of these 84th percentile grand motions across any of these earthquakes is is what is used the second part of these provisions says that if the largest spectral response acceleration of the deterministic response spectrums of the peak of that spectrum and it's less than 1.5 psycho efficient az7 16 tables then this response spectrum shall be scaled by single factors that's not the maximum response acceleration equals that one point five this is actually a floor on the deterministic ground motions there's also exception in this section for the deterministic ground motions says that they don't need to be calculated when the the peak of the probabilistic ground motion response spectrum is low enough load up being less than one point two times that F a site coefficient that gives you an out for calculating deterministic ground motions if you happen to be in love enough hazard area here's a flowchart of the ground motion site-specific motion procedures of chapter 21 that we just went through and let me step through these one by one so let's start with the first step which is calculating the probabilistic his risk targeted response spectrum next we check whether that probabilistic response spectrum is lower than 1.2 for example if you're in a high hazard area for psych class D that value would be 1 point 2 if this probabilistic response spectrum is then your MC sub R spectrum actually is just equal to that probabilistic spectrum but if the probabilistic response spectrum is the peak of it is larger than that one point you you do need to calculate deterministic 84th percentile ground motions a response spectrum there that could potentially cap the probabilistic response spectrum again the beginning of chapter 21 the section program ocean hazard analysis so they take the lesser of this probabilistic deterministic response spectrum so after you calculate the deterministic response spectrum you look to see if it's it's peak is large below this 1.5 again for example over high hazards like class to you that would be about 1.5 g if you're not the deterministic response spectrum the peak of it is not lower it doesn't need to be floored and so your maximum considered earthquake was targeted spectrum it's just the minimum of the probabilistic and deterministic response spectra and in black here now if your deterministic response spectrum it is quote unquote too too low then you have to scale that deterministic response spectrum up and and then that scaled deterministic respond spectrum is what is compared to the probabilistic response spectrum and again you take the smaller of those do to define here MCS of our crown motion spectrum having gone through the ASC 716 site-specific growling procedures I will turn to talking about the USGS web tools first for the probabilistic ground motions that are specified in those chapter 21 procedures later we'll do the deterministic part chapter 21 actually allows you to do your own probabilistic seismic hazard analysis the tools you'll see here are redoing your own pshe a rather they can use most recent P sha results from USGS B of these various tools so let's start with the USGS unified hazard tool that you see here for our purposes important sections here the input and hazard curved sections shown here opening me input section their various dropdowns and fields to fill in toughest choice and addition the user model that you interrogate here currently the most recent version is shown here the Conservatives US 2014 version and specifically it's it's dynamic version meaning this tool will then be doing publicity seismic hazard calculations on the fly coming soon in an edition of the terminus US 2018 as you modeled to this unified hazard or at least a revamped version of this of this tool that's gonna provide some more information that all summarized shortly but note now that for California at least the only difference between the 2014 and the 2018 editions here will be in areas of Los Angeles in San Francisco where there are basin effects so another part of this input from the unified hazard tool is specifying the site class or the shear wave velocity B is 30 you can see the options here and for our example that he'll show you will use that class D couple notes how things will change what we add the term is us 2018 addition to this web tool the site class options will be expanded probably a total of 8 psych class options that will be provided and ultimately also you could specify your own vs 30 besides these psych class classes there are also be a basement effects option added he's currently for the Los Angeles San Francisco Seattle and Salt Lake City regions initially this will be an option that really just lets you look at our primary results which are with Basin effects for the 2018 edition versus results without those Basin effects an offender in effect or with default based effects instead of region specific effects so one quick assign is the results now that you get in for her for a little while maybe for specif for pre-selected use of the shear wave velocity vs 30 again ultimately we hope to provide a tool that would let you answer any vs 30 but in the interim it is possible to interpolate seismic hazard results from those for some pre-selected PS slur he's like those for the site classes that you're shown on the previous line this just points to have white paper from the Geological Survey of Canada that looks into this interpolation and it's it's accuracy if this paper is not available online but if you email the authors and I think they're they're happy to discuss with you looking at the other inputs for this unified hazard tool in order for us to get probablistic promotions consistent with ASC 716 site-specific procedures we've gone through the addition that's the most recent now but that will be updated to 2018 to a latitude and longitude in this example it's a location in San Diego specified as a site class or using psych class D here and as you don't see the tool returns a hazard curves for all available spectral periods so really specify the spectral period and the time horizon here isn't strictly necessary inputs to the unified hazard tool you can scroll down on the tool further and there's this has a curved section you could push compute effectively and get out what you see here our focus here is on these hazard curves grab motion values versus their annual frequencies of exceedance or return periods or probabilities of exceedance in a 50 year time period saying as you see you get back hazard curves for a range of different spectral periods from zero or big ground acceleration 2 to 5 seconds couple notes about what's coming with the term as US 2018 additional look quite similar the spectra were periods will be expanded instead of 0 to 5 seconds as shown here you'll get spectral periods from 0 to 10 seconds and here we have 11 spectral periods there will be 22 spectral periods for which you'll you can get these hazard curves the theater update that we're working through is providing users the option not only for hazard curves like the ones you're looking at here which are for the geometric mean two horizontal components of ground shaking but locals have the option for as a curves that are in terms of the maximum direction that is specified in KSC 7/16 and was specified in ASE 710 as well guarding scale factors to go from geometric mean hazard curves to max Direction hazard curves ASC 7/16 in chapter 21 does provide seeing here such scale factors but it also mentions that if you can show that other scale factors more closely represent the backs of a response and maximum direction crown motions that those to be used in 7-1 alternative there is actually what's going to be in the new year 2020 provisions and it's already a resource paper in the 2015 near provisions they shown here on the right so the same section in chapter 21 but with with updated the maximum Direction scale factors that are based on research from rocky and Baker at Stanford and others so these scale factors are what I'll be using in the example for San Diego that we're working through and we can get scale factors at other periods as shown here by linear interpolation has shown there on the bottom right with the unified hazard tool we've gotten hazard curves we can scale by the max Direction scale factors on the previous slide the next step from the NSE 7/16 chapter xxi a site-specific motion hazard analysis procedure is to turn the those hazard curves into risk targeted ground motions the an iterative integration with an effective fragility curve so that's what this tool here does service target grab motion calculated here it's pretty simple the input is that hazard curve left there you see spectral response acceleration values or the X values of those such as a curve and annual frequency of exceedance values the Y values of such a hazard curve pressing compute risk target ground motion there and you get back the risk target grab motion shown in the yellow there and this is just a pre-populated example of what this risk targeted graduation calculator can do in addition to the simple input and output the res target grab motion calculation calculator also provides some figures like these the figure on top just shows the hazard curve that was input the next figure down shows the fragility curves which are iteratively generated because they depend on the final miss targeted ground motion value and other plots are shown by this this tool that show you more of the calculation the iterative calculation of the risk target to ground motion well this risk target crap margin calculator operates on one has a curve at a time a future goal of the USGS is to tie this calculator together with the unified hazard tools that you can calculate risk targeted ground motions for the full suite of hazard curves corresponding to different spectral periods tying together the unified hazard tool and the risk targeting commotion cap field hitter already be done with web services that are behind each of these web tools this here shows MATLAB code that does just that the first part of this MATLAB code uses this programmatic web service behind the unified hazard tool to get all the hazard curves for our San Diego location of interest in our site class d vs 30 the second part of this MATLAB code just scales those hazard curves from the unified hazard tools from geometric mean to Max traction growl motions and the third part of this MATLAB code uses a web service again programmatic web service behind the risk targeted grab motion calculator to for each of the hazard curves for different spectral periods compute the risk targeted grab motions in the loop that you see at the bottom of the slide using the MATLAB code on the previous slide or manually using the unified hazard tool to get the suite of hazard curves for his suite of spectral periods and then one by one plugging those hazard curves into the RISC targeted commotion calculator you do generate a risk targeted grab motion spectrum as shown here first was just these dots I've been showing the restarting ground motions has response spectrum using the terminus u.s. 2014 edition in the unified hazard tool which of course at this time is the most recent version overlaid on top of that the result that you will be able to generate yourself once the Qataris u.s. 2018 Edition is included in the unified hazard tool and you see the same results here because this is the location in San Diego and it's outside of the Los Angeles and San Francisco California regions where basic effects are are applied in the 2018 model but not in the 2014 so this is just to confirm to you that you know even with the 2014 edition of victorious us hasn't won from the USGS you can get results like what you'll be able to get from the 2018 let's remember that the peak of this was targeted promotion response spectrum is approaching one point behind going back to the flow chart of the chapter 21 Yesi 7 site-specific ground motion procedures we calculated the probabilistic risk targeted response spectrum at the top there knowing that its peak was about 1.9 G our site is in this example is a site Class D we are not below at the one point two ethane so we will need to calculate a deterministic 84th response spectrum for our site of interest but before I do that let's summarize the calculation of the probabilistic response spectrum to summarize the steps for calculating probabilistic grab motions and following a se7 site-specific promotion procedures and using USGS hazard rolls there are three steps first is to get has occurs for your site class or BS 30 of interest and for all of the available spectral periods from the unified hazard tool the second step is to scale scaled the ground motions of these hazard curves by period dependent maximum direct and scale factors note here if they didn't if they're not already scaled because as I mentioned future additions of the unified hazard drill we're hoping to provide users with the option to get other curves that are either geometric mean of two horizontal components or the maximum Direction horizontal shaking so you know keep track of that and it skill if needed and then the third step is to calculate risk target grab motions from a scale that is the maximum direction as or curves using the rest targeted ground motion calculator dr. outline now that we've computed the probabilistic promotions and determined that that wrist our emotion spectrum is high enough that we need to calculate deterministic ground motions we'll do that next that step next can just in summary there to us just web tools that we'll work through here first is a building seismic safety council scenario you know catalog for the characteristic earthquakes that are currently defining deterministic revolutions and then USGS responds back to a tool for calculating 84th percentile ground motions from those characteristic earthquakes if we're getting into those two additional yes yes web tools for calculating and deterministic grab motions I'm going to go back to the unified hazard tool for removal man because there is another part of that the D aggregation part of this unified hazard tool they can be useful even in calculating deterministic ground motions the inputs for the D aggregation and part of the yes yes unified hazard tool are of the same inputs is for the hazard curves that we've already calculated the outputs are different that yours for those familiar with the aggregation here's what you might be more familiar with which is a plot that shows the relative contribution to the hazard from earthquakes of different magnitudes and source to site distances there's another part of the D aggregation and output that you might not be quite as familiar with scrolling down on the D aggregation output you'll reach this D aggregation contributor section which provides the contribution to the total hazard from different fault sources a lot of details in this right now that will be reformulated in the next versions of the unified hazard tool but let's focus here box here which shows that for our San Diego site of interest in this example that the Rose Canyon fault is dominating the hazard there are also Oceanside Coronado Bank and faults that are in the region as well and then you see our there's is the closest distance to these fault so for Rose Canyon those are different segments they're closest distance is 1.41 this is in kilometers and that'll be useful for calculating 84th percentile ground motions later in our process now you also see magnitudes here the ASC 722 what's being proposed there is to use magnitudes from the aggregation of the hazard but until the details of those types of the aggregations are within this unified hazard tool we'll move forward using the building seismic safety council scenario catalog mentioned here's the webpage for the BSC scenario catalog this catalog of characteristic earthquakes that were used for the deterministic Ram oceans of the 2015 New Year provisions and hence all so far for ASC 716 the probabilistic crab motions in is the maps of ASC 716 were actually developed using a more recent version of the Uniform California earthquake rupture forecast you serve use of three which didn't follow the model of characteristic earthquakes it allowed for earthquake ruptures that only rupture parts of segments of faults in several segments at the same time so there was a challenge in developing the characteristic earthquakes were the ASC 716 deterministic ground motions that was met by coming up with this set of characteristic earthquakes that's cataloged here this webpage was developed by Eric Thompson who is using these characteristics earthquake section just to provide scenario information not for design purposes but for other purposes so the ground motion Maps they provide will be in terms of things like modified Mercalli intensity but at the lower right part of this if we could scroll down we would see a whole long list of hundreds of characteristic earthquakes that again were used for the deterministic ground motions part of the ASC 716 Crabbe motion maps and then you can see here that there will also be able to look at a map of all these characteristic earthquakes here's the map view of the hundreds of characteristic earthquakes that were used for the deterministic ground motion part of the AC 716 growl motion Maps looming into the San Diego region we can find the Rose Canyon fault inside coronado bank but focusing on the Rose Canyon fault prayer now we can also get from this characteristic magnitude 7 for Rose Canyon so I've got the distance about 1.4 kilometers from our San Diego site of interest to in Rose Canyon from the D aggregation through the unified hazard tool and now we have the magnitude of the Rose Canyon characteristic rupture the earthquake magnitude and distance are the primary parameters that are needed to calculate the 84th percentile spectral accelerations that were working towards but anyone who's used a ground motion model to do such calculations knows that there are other parameters besides magnitude and distance that are that are required as input unfortunately these other parameters are a bit more difficult to get out at this stage but here I'm showing the github repository behind the BSS CA 2014 scenario catalog that does have files shown here that you serve three file is the file for California and it lists more details about each of the characteristic earthquakes for example the Rose Canyon characteristic earthquake and it gives you enough detail so that you can also determine the other parameters you need to plug into a ground motion model like break Z toppers eat or dip with and also you can calculate from these vault details in these files distanced here to your site that's just a calculation that's done in the D aggregation tool of the unified hazard tool and that's why I got it there with the earthquake magnitude in distance and other parameters now we're ready to calculate the 84th percentile spectral accelerations you can use this USGS response spectra tool for that purpose so we may be familiar with the NJ West spreadsheets that will do calculations for the nga West ground motion models this is in concept similar this USGS tool includes around motion all the ground motion models that are used in the USGS hazard modeling including motion models for the central and eastern US in addition to the West so still not see to selected ground motion models of interest and then specify things like magnitude in these other parameters specifically for our San Diego example on the Rose Canyon characteristic earthquakes here we can select ground motion models these are NJ West tube ground motion models that were used for the 2018 USGS national seismic hazard model it'll see the left there above that you could select what was used for the 2014 USGS hazard models it's the same NJ west to grab motion models although there's there's one that was dropped for 2018 and for each of these models we need to specify the magnitude distance rate and other parameters on the left bottom left if you're able to scroll down you would see the input for parameters other than magnitude but I'm just summarizing there that on the right here so a Rose Canyon is a earthquake characteristic earthquake is a magnitude seven rigsy dip with we got from that github repository the distance we also could get from that game hub repository oh I got it from the aggregation part of the unified hazard tool and you specify B as 30 for example of 260 is our site class D yes 30 and C 1.1 Z 2.5 our our base index here in for the San Diego location we don't have based in depth information so that's left blank and essentially defaults are are used for that with all the inputs on the previous slide when you try this response back out there's a bun tab to compute to this spectra and you'll get a plot like we see on the right so the top part of that plot is showing the median ground motions as a function of spectral period for each of the four crab motion models that we've selected on the bottom right there are the grammars and standard deviations again as a function of period for the four different crab motion models we've generated the response spectra for four different ground motion models make sure that then comes up is how you combine these results for the maps of a sc7 16 the deterministic ground motions resulting from these foreground motion models were weighted in the same way they're weighted in the US yes national seismic hazard model and one convenient feature of this response vector tool is that it gives you an option to select as a ground motion model so the combination that it was used for in this case the 2018 USGS hazard model you can see there on the left above the highlighted 2018 is an option for 2014 either with the interest grab motion model or or without interest was dropped only because now we're moving towards calculating hazard for some softer soil conditions that aren't included in that crowd motion model so the purple of your line on the right is the response spectrum once we've waited the for individual ground motion spectra and with in this case it's it happens to be equal weighting and when you look at other ground motion models around the USA and the subduction area here in the central eastern US it's not necessarily equal weighting but it gives you the that combined median response spectrum and also a combination of the standard deviations from the four different ground motion models in that bottom right in addition to the deterministic response vector plots this this tool also allows you to access the data behind those plots so you're seeing that on the on the right here and pretty small for most of you the data that you can pour it over but the first step is that you know this they are giving the logarithmic means and the median ground motions also the logarithmic Sigma's are standard deviations and of course what we're interested in for to follow the ASC 7 site-specific ground motion procedure is calculating 84th percentile ground motions that's a simple combination of what's reported by this tool I mean take them the means multiplied them by the exponent of the the Sigma's and that gives you and each particular spectral period the 84th percentile ground motions that we can now go back and compare with the probabilistic risk targeted response spectrum that we calculated earlier and here's a part of those 84th percentile response spectra a deterministic response spectra again we're still on our San Diego site might resumed site class D so I'm showing here the four different growl motion models in the thinner lines and again that's a testament to if you calculate deterministic 84th percentile ground motions the chapter 21 of 87 16 doesn't specify exactly which ground motion model you need to use so you could in theory choose any one of those those are the four that are used in the latest version of the USGS hazard model and the combined thicker magenta line there again is is a weighted combination and so in this example I move forward with that that combined weighted combination again recognizing that chapter 21 AC 716 does not specifically say which grand motion models are required to be used let's see after the combined plan here that will move forward with let's note that the peak is about 2.5 g now that we have the deterministic 84th percentile response spectrum let's go back to our flow chart site-specific revolution procedures chapter 21 so we need to check that for the 84th percentile response spectrum and see if it's falls below 1.5 FA which is been for example a class D relatively high hazard is 1.5 g and the previous slide we saw that the peak was about 2.5 g so so now our deterministic spectrum is not below that level and that means that the MC sub our final ground motion spectrum would be taken as the minimum of the the probabilistic and deterministic response spectra shown in black on this on this flowchart before we take the minimum of deterministic and probabilistic spectra that we've generated using the US yes tools let me summarize the steps for the deterministic ground motion part alone first step is to get characteristic earthquakes on all known active faults within the region that's quoting the deterministic section of chapter 21 and we can get those from this BSS de 2014 scenario catalog color she would change the name of that to 2015 the new year provisions actually came out in 2015 but those characteristic earthquakes and parameters like magnitude distance and other parameters from that scenario catalog we can get logarithmic means and standard deviations or Sigma's of the ground motions from the response spectra tool and then the third step is from those means and simulations we can get 84% out.grab motions as I showed but we also have to remember that the deterministic Ram motions are also in ASC 7:16 specified to be for the direction of maximum response so we would scale those 84th percentile ground motions by the period dependent maximum Direction scale factors the same ones that we applied for the probabilistic ground motions and here is that again if not already scaled because future versions of the risk response vector tool from the USGS could give the users the option for either generating spectra that are max direction or geometric mean for now their geometric mean and so applying those back stretch that scale factors is something you need to do on your own just to emphasize where we are on this flowchart of chapter 21 calculations we ended up here where we say the MC sub R growl motion spectra are just thinking is the minimum of the probabilistic and the deterministic response vector that we've calculated using the various USGS tools for this site specific application here on one plot for our San Diego example all sigh Class D is the first the probabilistic risk targeted response spectrum shown in black and magenta they are the deterministic 84th percentile promotion that we've calculated again we're taking the minimum of these T Spectre / ASC 716 chapter 21 and of course in this case for the San Diego site that would correspond to the probabilistic risk target response spectrum so in this example but not all examples the final mcs of our spectrum is equal to the probabilistic risk targeted spectrum we've worked through the ASC 716 site-specific remotion procedures using us just web tools for both probabilistic and deterministic ground motions and arrived at an MC sub R response spectrum that can be considered a site-specific response spectrum in fact and for a se7 22 it's being explicitly mentioned in chapter 21 that such spectra derived from USGS what tools can be considered as site-specific spectra so at this stage I wanted to talk about one more us just web told us yes yes web service for the 2020 me her provisions and ultimately for ATSC 722 and I wanted to talk about this because the service also follows the ASC 716 site-specific remotion procedures but with some exceptions that I'll note as we work through an example because of those exceptions it's debatable whether the response background of this 2020 me here provisions web service could also be considered a site-specific response spectrum that's consistent with a SE 716 chapter 21 I think there is an argument that it could be made in favor of that but even barring that it's useful to look at the results from this web service to compare against what you might do for a site-specific whether it's using the various one you're just web tools that we've worked through or your own site specific analysis here's the documentation for the neeterb 2020 a web service some of you may be familiar with the ASC 716 version of this these web services from USGS really are fed into web interfaces like the ASC 7 hazard tool the ATC seismic to all the the CR tool all those tools those interfaces pull from these USGS web services currently safer ASC 716 as an example and in the future for this new year 2020 web service so the input to this web service is the latitude longitude of your site of interest like ours in Diego site the risk category and that's for seismic design category determination and then you can also have a plate here a site class there are eight different site classes bless a default and one thing that's a little different using this web service variance is doing it more site-specific analysis like we've worked through is that these there are only these 8sy class options in their respective vs thirties that were used there so if you want results for a different via 30 you'd either have to interpolate these results or and go back to using the the various other usgs web tools to kind of step-by-step work through the site specific procedures for your specific vs 30 another thing I'll note here is that this web service pulls from pre computed response Petra on a grid that covers the United States and so for a particular location the results are interpolate it from that grid and using all the USGS web tools that we've gone through you could calculate hazard for a specific blonde without that interpolation so that's another potential difference but those inputs to the web service here is just a subset of the output it's much longer less but the key components for our purposes is that this web service returns risk targeted probabilistic spectrum with in this case it would have 22 spectral periods and also an 84th percentile deterministic spectrum again for the 22 spectral periods so these are the equivalents of what we computed working through the ASC 716 chapter 21 site-specific procedure these these results actually do use the 2018 USGS hazard model including Basin effects in Los Angeles San Francisco and also in Seattle in Salt Lake City and yeah these results also make use of the more recent max Direction factors from shahi and Bakker so a lot of the same components that we've worked through with the various yes just web tools are are brought together in in this web service so let's look at the comparison of what we just went through and what this web service returns for example senior location you see was that Class D there here's a pot that we've seen already in black the probabilistic risk targeted spectrum that we derived using the USGS unified hazard tool and also the USGS risk targeting ground motion calculator and then in magenta is a deterministic 84th percentile ground motion that we derived by getting characteristic earthquakes from the USGS webpage for the pssc scenario catalog and also the USGS response spectrum tool so ultimately these we took the minimum of these two per se 7/16 chapter 21 and you know the MCS of our spectrum resulted in as a result the probabilistic risk targeted spectrum shown here but for now let's just compare these two response spectra to what comes out of the 2020 her provisions web service so the black circles they're from the 2020 year web service and we see we get exactly the same results as what we went through Union using the unified hazard tool and the risk targeted grab motion calculator and that's because the procedures of ASC 716 for the probabilistic ground motions are the same as those in the air 2020 provisions and and are being proposed to be the same for ASC 722 in both cases for the probabilistic we used the usgs 2018 national seismic hazard model is the underlying hazard information we use the same max direction scale factors the updated ones from based on shahi and Baker so we get exactly the same result for the deterministic points here you see obviously a difference between what we have two solid line working through the USGS web tools versus what comes out of this New York 2020 web service and really the key difference is that now for the new Europe 2020 provisions and what's being proposed for ASC 722 is the characteristic earthquakes that are defined in an ASC 716 chapter 21 are these future editions being redefined as so-called scenario earthquakes that are based on the aggregation of the hazard rather than the characteristic earthquakes and so that difference results in different magnitudes for example here for Rose Canyon the characteristic was a magnitude 7 the from based on the aggregation it varies as a function of period but it's lower than that especially for some of the longer periods and that's causing the the difference that you're seeing here between those magenta suppose in the in the magenta line there's also slight difference in how the 84th percentile ground motions are are calculated for this new year 2020 web service is taking advantage of calculations that USGS has already done in doing the probabilistic hazard but the main difference here is the the magnitude that comes out of the aggregation versus characteristic earthquakes and see 716 and again I think you know since characteristic earthquakes are fully defined anymore for a California an argument can be made as to whether how you determined that magnitude perhaps to teen aggregation we doing without that as you see this is serves as a comparison to what we got out of following the site-specific procedures using the four different yes yes web tools and it provides a a check of that information it made it to the submarine so now I'll just recap this suite of USGS web tools that are useful for our site-specific crab motion procedures of ASC 716 and also provide the two web links to each of those I know they may have been hard to see young on each of the slides we've already seen to recap for the probabilistic promotions that are specified in chapter 21 of ASC 7 one can use the unified hazard tool to get hazard curves and then the risk targeted grab motion calculator to calculate risk targeted ground motions from the hazard curves a couple notes here the unified hazard tool right now gives you hazard curves for the 2014 USGS hazard model which is what was used for a c7 16 but you see it will also be able to get hazard courage for the 2018 USGS hazard model another note is that the unified hazard tool at this stage returns as it curves that are for the geometric mean of two horizontal components rather than the max direction horizontally so you have to apply back stretch and scale factors before plugging into the risk target crab motion calculator and ultimately we hope to add that option for max direction crab motions to the unified hazard tool and even connect these tools directly to make it easier on the user the risk target we've got motion calculator right now you have to calculate use it one as a curve at a time so for each spectral period of your response break go for example but there is a web service behind that calculator and all these tools that allows you to automate that procedure programmatically using MATLAB or potentially in Excel for the deterministic grant motion specified in chapter 21 over AC 716 there are two web tools yes yes that can be helpful to the first is the PSoC scenario catalog for characteristic earthquakes in your region of interest and then the response vector tool for 84th percentile crowd motion calculations and at this stage is more difficult to run through these deterministic calculations but the scenario catalog does provide just a girth quakes magnitudes getting distances and other parameters that are used for the ground motion calculation is a bit more challenging but the information is there and then the response vector tool is akin to the NGO a spreadsheet that magnitude distance and the other parameters and get back mean and standard deviations of ground motions up and you can easily calculate 84th percentile ground motions from so these these four tools can be used to follow the chapter 21 like specific ground motion analysis procedure of AEC 7/16 and then this last web service is something you can compare against potentially use as your site specific response spectrum it's the web service for the 2020 New Year provisions and ultimately for ASC 722 we hope this webinar was helpful we recognize that at this point in time following the ASC 7 procedures for site-specific ground motion hazard analysis involves several several of our tools and several steps so we welcome your questions here are our email addresses and we'd also appreciate your feedback on the tools as we further develop them and improve them thank you okay Thank You Nico Thank You Nico very much thank you for the presentation there are a lot of questions here I'm going to pick just some of them so question that we have received I think that we apologize for the audio issues we are going to improve those issues I mean try to resolve those issue for the next webinar in the remaining of the time it will we have only time for a twist but one of the question rico is basing effects are either in tools in these tools for the calculation of the spectra of the pr2 so because X 4 functions San Francisco to Los Angeles Cielo in Salt Lake City and included in result that you can get when we have the 2018 USGS hazard model and if I have to draw loop on there we have a web service for that even once that public you'll hear it is also good placement effects and idea is that they also tried often monopoly and I think you can see just to reiterate that it's it's specific to those four regions and it's the first time that we've included regional or site or data relative to a site in the actual national seismic hazard model and will provide documentation on how to use our tools and we'll update our tools to allow you to input custom base and values if that's something you're that people are interested in okay there is one question here particularly on slide 21 slide 21 the question is is a linear interpolation is linear interpolation or on the low block of linear it has been implemented for the 2020 New Year provisions in 8722 linear logarithmic scale okay the other one is a method one for calculating the risk targeted probabilistic round motion will be discontinued on ADC 722 correct yeah so you see sound 16 you'll see it there but right at all it's not going to be there in what's being valid it is 722 and that's why I didn't go through that in this my examples and the reason for that is again method 1 with coefficients here in 87 16 come from using hazard for the reference I class and from somewhat different than what the collision typically you get out of hazards for a specific site closer cause yeah 30 ago another 2 allows you to capture that my closet really affect nothing one doesn't and it's like being removed all things I do very safety 7/10 really because there is some concern that second back if we only had Malcolm to here's a hard time applying this and though not one was included as a simpler approach devoted to is proposed me because I can now people here's the method okay so teaching for Peter Fournier both sites do pectoral accelerations calculated by the unified the hazard tools incorporate directivity factors if so what activity moreover is being used if not similar to multimode Direction can be factored be added into the tool in reading this question I have two possible responses if the question is about directivity effects in the models those are not incorporated into the national seismic hazard model nor are they so possible to compute or can be considered in the ground motion models the national seismic hazard uses however if we're talking about similar as the latter part of the question suggests similar to max direction the directivity component the direction component of ground motion in our models is a function of what component the ground motion model developers used and so for instance in 2014 that was still wrote i fifty and then with the 2018 model sorry I'm missing I think it's wrote I 50 20 2008 and then in the western US for 2014 and following into 2018 it becomes wrote d50 and there are also the the then conversions to max direction that Niko went over and is our plan and the very near term both for delivery of precomputed static hazard curves and dynamically computed ones to provide a checkbox to do that scaling within the different tools that we provide one of our goals is to allow the different companies portions of this computational pipeline to be easily chained together in as much that someone would be able to go and get the pre computed hazard curves do the correct conversions pass that data off to the RISC targeted ground motion services or applications and ultimately compute design ground motions with all of the custom information that a user might have for specific sites so custom vs xxx if that's of interest I think that answers the question it was it was a bit broad the way I read it okay this is a question for also for new Peter we're presenting identity an insta calculation there was a mention of the well maybe DC for Nikko there was a mention of lower limit deterministic spectrum can you please clarify okay so when it is for the particular side amara discussed that was in slide 11 and so 87 16 before supplement 1 actually had a deterministic lower limit that was time to point to second and 1 second values of 1.5 G's in point 60 respectively uncommon yeah speckle shape pop-top fractal shape deterministic law to find by that now in supplement wine of AZ's on 16 which can even find on a line but but we revised it's going to survive say well you find a deterministic smooth spectrum and the reason advises a flattop spectrum can use out of them similar to glow then I ended up with weird I don't become a nesting ground motions when you poured your calculator icon by the product one so and hope when I win this and you tiger deterministic is going percentile response like them and the fraying of that just is if the peak to know it's working you get to scale it up going to give you the values they're going on here but essentially if the peak is below 1.5 FA and for example up day was one then you have to scale up your you quickly spent on commotion today yeah X's are it is a four so you don't get deterministic emotions that are very very low please Gloria provided it seems a little bit it doesn't point in to you there but still be valid and there still some ideas are there coming up there so we'll see exactly what happens a little mystical or a limit the journalistic remotion okay another question is that evading any plan for a tool for vertical ground motions yes go ahead no it's honor it sits on our list which is a long list but it's got a number of items on there that are of interest more broadly within the engineering community other things that we are considering are being able to provide maps of peak ground velocity please with any additions that you would like to see added to our tools or map products things that we pre calculate or provide web services and applications for please email us with those requests and they will be considered in due course to levels in her right one is whether you USGS you know calculate vertical gras motion causing directly or therefore that you can use can be quote unquote site-specific type tool to do that because that is 1987 16 1080 720 to both approximate vertical down motion with equations they're becoming the horizontal motion so very um a se 715 early yeah you're cleaning up your hands you can drink either going to box nations are also included in the design I'm super big just like the plenty plenty who provisions to that one out of the vertical can sit in but if you want approximation we look at the design tool if their ultimate college hazard actually calculated the vertical that's it your work alright I think that there are still more crystal here and we are very close to in this webinar today if you have more question please direct those questions to Nico and Peter you have already their email addresses so as much as I can we'll try to answer those question finally to finalize the winner winner - Danny we would like to yeah you can see there the email addresses of Nico and Peter and they will try to answer your additional questions for this presentation just to finalize this webinar I would like to make a couple of announcements so if you have some interest on the same topic this English lecture functional recovery what it means to design for community resilience so they will be on April 29th at 11 a.m. Pacific time we are going to receive a invitation if you are interested also to participate to attend this webinar on April 29th which is also Wednesday so we think three three weeks okay this is our webinar we are trying to swap the open announcement is about you have any interest on PD - information they will be provided in a follow-up email please also we will appreciate if you have any feedback there is a survey post webinar survey please join he arrived if you have if you are not a member and you are interested to enjoy all the benefits of being a member here right also in the in our electronic newsletter the polls you are going to see announcement for the upcoming webinars finally we would like to acknowledge and appreciate the support from FEMA on the US Department of Homeland Security for making Possible's these webinars one thing this is it for now and thank you very much for your attendance and see you on April 29th for our next webinar thank you", "8vir5c6QqvI": "hello welcome and um i'm michelle reimer a dietitian with the ymca of metropolitan milwaukee welcome to my kitchen and welcome to another edition of something's cooking at the y um i love fall this is one of my favorite times of year and so this month during our cooking demos on thursday mornings we will be focusing on some fall dishes specifically some fall soups and salads and desserts so i'm really excited to share this with you today the first thing we are going to be making is a ginger butternut squash soup um so to get that started i need to heat my pan and then also heat a little bit of oil as always we're using some extra virgin olive oil that's been cold pressed so you want to make sure you're buying the cold pressed olive oil so that it maintains more of those good fats in into maintains more of the structure those good fats so we're going to warm up that extra virgin olive oil and i'm going to add a couple things so making a soup um we always like to use things like onions and celery and garlic kind of that trinity of really yummy ingredients to make soup so we're going to start out by heating up and sauteing our onions our celery and also our garlic so i'm going to go ahead and put that in and i'm doing this over a medium low heat today one reason i like to do that is garlic if it's too hot your garlic will burn and then you'll have kind of that burnt taste flavoring or garlic now the garlic is amazing it's an anti in an antiviral and in it it has compounds that when it's crushed the oxygen reacts with it the allicin and it helps to reduce antiviral antibacterial so it's just really good for our immune function so let's get that garlic in there too all right and as that cooks we will start to prepare a few other things one thing that we are going to add to this soup is an apple um this is just an organic i don't know if this is i think this is a gala apple that i had gotten um and i need to chop it up because i'm gonna actually cook it as part of my soup and it's gonna give a little bit more sweetness and tartness to it so i'm just going to take my apple slicer and slice into little slices and then i will just chop those slices up you can leave the peel on the apple which is really nice because the peel tends to have a lot of the nutrients it also has that insoluble fiber that's really good for our digestive system and keeping that moving and keeping it clean and healthy now you may be thinking why would we put chunks of apple in there i mentioned that it does it'll add like some really nice flavor to it a really nice harvest flavor um but also we're going to be pureeing this soup with a hand mixer or a ham carrier and so we won't necessarily have those big chunks of of apples in there um but it will give us the flavor and then it'll get all diced up so let's put that in here um also we i wanted to talk a little bit about the spices that we're using in this soup the first spice i'm using is a curry and this is a curry that i really love it's by pensies so it has a few extra things added to it it has turmeric coriander cumin garlic also some fennel and nutmeg cilantro cloves cardamom and ginger so really love this this combination here and then the second spice we're using is actually just a basic pumpkin pie spice and i've used this in our soup today and we also are going to use it in our muffins that we're making so again with fall upon us i love cooking with the winter squashes and then adding in some of that pumpkin flavor so i hope you like it too i'm going to give this a stir and i can already smell the onions they're delicious and the celery all that smell together we're gonna now add some ginger um now with the ginger ginger root i have some i i've already chopped it up um ginger root one of my tricks for peeling it is to actually just use a spoon and you just take the side of the spoon and you pull it across the skin of the ginger you tend to use lose less of the ginger root than if you were to use a peeler it just comes off really nicely this recipe says that you can grate it so you could take that 2 inch peeled piece of ginger root and grate it but i because i'm going to be pureeing it i actually just chopped it so i had my chef's knife and i chopped it up i minced it up and we're going to add that now as always if you don't have fresh ginger root it's okay to substitute um with some dried or some powdered dry ginger whoops all right so i added my ginger root i'm gonna now add my curry and then also my pumpkin pie spice and at this point sometimes the spice will um start to adhere to the bottom of the pan so it looks a little bit brown we're going to do what we call deglazing and deglazing is using something like a wine or water or a broth to loosen that up off the bottom of the pan so i'm just going to pour a little bit of broth in here so that i can make sure that i'm not losing those those yummy flavors um and having them being burned on the bottom of my pan okay this is wonderful all right so now we are going to actually go on to add our broth our apple and our squash so let's talk a little bit about the broth i'm using um sometimes i will actually make um vegetable broth by myself let me grab my bake from the freezer and show you i can find it here where did it go here we go sorry for the delay sorry about that i think that tells me i need to clean up my um freezer a little bit um i actually keep a bag in my freezer so that when i'm cutting any of my vegetables up things like carrots and celery onions peppers and i have any leftovers i put them in a freezer bag and then someday on the weekend i'll put these either in the crock pot or on the stove add some water add a little bit of seasoning to it and then just continue to cook it down so that i can make my own vegetable broth well as you can see this bag is really full and so i need to um actually make some broth of my own but i didn't i didn't have that made today so we are going to use what we call the better than bullion broth what i like about this is it's a paste you do keep it in the refrigerator but then you can adjust how much broth one you want to make so if let's say you only need two cups of broth you don't want to buy a big container or broth and then have that leftover in the refrigerator i do recommend if you do have the pre-made broth and you do end up refrigerating on it refrigerating it um i always recommend writing the date that you opened and then how much is left in there so that you um know when it's been put in there and then how much you have so if you want to use it for another another um dish so this what i did and this is typically one teaspoon for every cup i have four cups of broth i actually use two teaspoons um i find that if i use the one teaspoon to one cup sometimes it's really salty and i try to keep the amount of salt in my diet down the amount of sodium and that's good because when we have too much salt in our diet it can impact our blood pressure so we are going to use this broth that i made up all right we're going to add our apples and this is such a nice time of the year i know around the area there's a lot of apple orchards i have lots of friends that are taking pictures and showing pictures of picking apples on facebook so um i can remember as a child we always would drive up to door county to take pictures and to um to pick apples and then my mom of course would always make lots of good apple desserts so everything from apple pie to apple crumble and we loved it the last thing i'm going to add in here as we cook it is the butternut squash i wanted to share with you a trick that i have learned that helps me to prepare my butternut squash a little bit easier so butternut squash is can be really hard to cut and one of the things that i'm always trying to work on is my safety in the kitchen especially with knives so that we don't have any cuts we talked before about when you're holding your chef knife to have that claw grip putting one thumb on this side of the blade and then your pointer finger on the other side of the blade so that it gives you a little bit more control over that blade um we've also talked about holding whatever you're cutting with your fingers down so that your fingers aren't stuck out where the blade can get you it would just rub across that part of your your knuckle so what i did with my butternut squash is um i used to just sit there and try and cut through it and it was always really difficult so i learned that you could put a bunch of different little um holes in it with using a fork so i just pricked it with forks um and then i actually wrapped it in a piece of um paper towel i put it in the microwave for five minutes and when it came out after five minutes it was so much easier to cut and um it was easier than to kind of scoop out all of the the seeds and that type of stringy stuff that was inside so i had a butternut squash about this long um and this is half of it so it did produce a lot of butternut squash um i once i had cut it i then put salt and pepper and olive oil on it face down on a cookie sheet and i baked it for about 30 35 minutes i then removed it from the oven and i let it cool before i pulled off the skin because it was nice and roasted the skin pulled off really nicely after it had cooled otherwise you could always just use a spoon to scoop it out so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to add my butternut squash and that beautiful color of the butternut squash tells us that it has some really amazing phytochemicals in it so we are getting lots of antioxidants from that beautifully colored butternut squash butternut squash is also fantastic it's a good source of different vitamins like vitamin c vitamin a and then also it's a great source of fiber and fiber is important to help us maintain our blood um our vascular system um in terms of reducing our cholesterol um but also as i mentioned earlier when we talked about the outside peel of the apple that it's important for helping our digestive system to maintain on track all right so i'm going to let this cook for a little while and then we'll come back to it um puree it and add some coconut milk and then a few other garnishes so let's let that simmer for us we'll jump back and forth but in the meantime i'd love to show you this amazing salad that i'm gonna make it's a pear fennel and pecan salad um the recipe that i'll post actually calls for a red sauerkraut which i typically buy in the refrigerated section of my grocery store however they were sold out and so i wanted to make sure that i had some type of fermented product on my salad because that fermentation that fermented product actually feeds the good bacteria that are in my gut and i want to feed those bacteria because they produce lots of different signals and hormones and and vitamins that help my body to maintain be healthy and happy so instead of the red sauerkraut because i couldn't find that i actually made some pickled red onion and i just made these up this morning it usually only takes about an hour to really get that benefit what i did is i took a red onion which that beautiful magenta color again tells us that we are getting some amazing phytochemicals and antioxidants in our red onion i sliced it up very thin i placed it in this mason jar and then i just covered it with red wine vinegar it's as easy as that within an hour the red wine vinegar starts to break down some of that the walls of the onion and the starch is released and so they actually become a little bit sweeter and not you don't have that that strong taste as much so these actually are really nice i usually will keep these in my refrigerator and add them to sandwiches or to salads i'm just very versatile so instead of the red sauerkraut i made these red onions all right so let's then talk about what we are going to be doing um with our salad so you could make this up in a really big bowl that would be just fine i'm just going to make up a plate and show you how this salad looks so i'm going to add some mixed greens and of course we can always get more green leafy greens in our diet um dark leafy greens are good source of iron and fiber um vitamin k and things like that that are really important for our immune function and for our vascular system so we've got some leafy greens here um i then i sliced up half of a fennel bulb and um many times i'd cook with fennel seed but this time i'm actually cooking with the fresh bulb i cut it in half you've seen me probably in the grocery store they smell delicious kind of like a black licorice and then i just sliced it up very very thinly um to add to my salad so i have some here so i'm gonna add a little bit of that sliced up fennel to my salad um the next thing i'm going to add are some pears some sliced up pears um these pears actually came from my mom's pear tree she was visiting um last weekend and brought me a big bag of pears that she grew so you could use any type of pear you like sometimes i will use a bosque pair because it does tend to be kind of more creamy on the inside but because i had these pears i wanted to use them up so that is what we are using i'm all about using whatever's local and fresh and if it if something looks like it's about to go bad in my refrigerator i make sure that i do something with it and cook something or put it in the freezer so i've got my um pears on here and actually i would say a red pear looks gorgeous on this um you could also put apples apple slices too as well all right so then the next thing that we are going to add is where's my feta we've got some feta cheese here you could also use blue um a blue cheese i um it's it's just too pungent for me so i prefer to go with this feta cheese um feta cheese it's a softer cheese it tends to have a little bit less fat in it than one of the harder cheeses so it's a good option there is a lot of sodium in it though but again if we're just using it in little piece little amounts here and there all foods fit um the next thing i did is i actually toasted up some pecans now pecans are an excellent source of unsaturated fats and those fats are actually very good for our heart our heart health and our vascular system so um while nuts do tend to be higher in calories because they're higher in fat and fat per gram has more calories than let's say a carbohydrate or a protein so they're very energy dense but they're also nutrient dense so having a handful of nuts is is actually really good for your your health um in the mediterranean diet they eat nuts several days a week if not almost every day so i like to toast my nuts because then it gives them more of a nutty warm flavor so i just toasted these up you want to make sure that you are watching and stirring before i've tried to multi-task with my my with my toasting and have forgot and then i burnt them and that's a bummer because nuts actually are fairly expensive so i'm going to add some of these nuts that i toasted then what i'll do with the rest of these is i'm just going to put them in an air tight container and then i can save them for the next time i want to throw them on a salad or soup or just want a handful of them this is actually a really good time of the year too where if you're carving pumpkins you can take those pumpkin seeds and wash them up and dry them and then also roast them in the oven and those would be delicious on a salad or in the soup that i make that we're making as well so we do have some pecans on here the next thing we're going to add is our red onion and so like i said just just about an hour and these already are starting to soften and lose kind of that that flavor that makes them a little bit um on the the bitter side and then i can also add some fresh ground pepper to this i am going to make up a little salad dressing very quickly so another thing is that salad dressings there's such a huge variety at the grocery store however they tend to have lots of things added to them i like to then just make my own and today we're just going to be making a very basic balsamic we're using again that extra virgin olive oil that has been cold pressed and i'm just gonna put about a quarter cup in here this is my mason jar um then i'm going to add a little bit of balsamic vinegar and depending on what ratio you like you can adjust this however you like the recipe that i will be posting says one quarter cup of olive oil and one tablespoon of balsamic i love balsamic vinegar especially the aged balsamic vinegar because it gets creamier and sweeter and so i like to put a little bit more balsamic in than that this recipe also calls for just a little splash of maple syrup so you could use some sugar that would be fine as well i like to use the maple syrup it brings again i don't know maple syrup and fall always just seemed to kind of go together for me i could also take some pepper and salt and add that to here as well but i have so many great flavors on my salad that i don't think i really need to add that so we are just going to shake it up another thing i love about the mason jar and pour it over our salad now if you were making this in a really big bowl you could just pour this over the bowl and then toss it so however works best for you and so this is our beautiful fennel pear and actually red onion salad all right so let's give our soup a stir and see how we're doing here oh this smells so wonderful i wish you could smell it um i think it needs probably about five more minutes before we go to puree it just to continue to soften the um the apples that are in there the the butternut squash has already been cooked so that's already pretty soft but it'll help to kind of get all those flavors mixed together so then let's talk about my favorite thing dessert um today what i have made for you is a whole grain pumpkin chocolate chip mini muffin now when i've made things before you know i've made them mini because i think that helps with portion control let me get them i actually made these last night and they are so moist and wonderful i had one with my breakfast and i'm going to cut it in half so you can kind of see the inside of it as well um so these are made with pumpkin and the pumpkin is one of the things that keeps it really moist but let me talk about a couple of the other ingredients too that make it a really nice and a little bit healthier dessert so the first thing that i started out with was this is bob's red mill and it's 100 stone ground whole wheat pastry flour so i decided to use a pastry flour because pastry flour has less protein in it than an all-purpose or a bread flour and the reason that matters is because the gluten formation in bread occurs when water connects with gluten and glycogen which are two of the bread protein flour proteins wheat proteins that come together to make gluten well gluten is important because as the dough bakes it allows it to expand and it is like a network and it traps the gas in there that's being created by your leavening agent so your leavening agent could be something like yeast that produces carbon dioxide or maybe in this case like we used we use some baking powder and baking soda so when it has less protein it actually gives you a more tender product and so with my muffin i want a nice soft tender muffin and so using a pastry flour will help you to do that because of the lower protein content i'll say i haven't seen any other types of whole wheat pastry flour available except for this bob's red mill but i'm sure you can you can find it somewhere else but um again i like this this actually still was produced with some of the the hall and the germ on it and so that's great because it there's three grams of dietary fiber and then we also have our iron in there and potassium and other really good vitamins and minerals that a lot of times we lose when we process grain into white flour so i use the whole wheat flour i also use the 100 pumpkin um this is just an all natural no preservatives nothing added to it so you don't want to use the pumpkin pie mix sometimes you can buy the can that already has the spices in it this one i just wanted plain pumpkin so i used about two thirds of a cup of that um and i added some eggs a little bit of canola oil and then i mixed it all together now i wanted to make sure that i didn't mix it too much if you mix your batter too much what happens is you get too much gluten production so remember gluten is what gives us that structure however if we produce too much of it it actually expands so much that it can't it can't hold the weight and then it actually will fall or crack so i wanted to make sure that my muffins had a nice little round top and the crumb is nice and even on these and so i know that i didn't over i didn't over stir them or under serve them as well and of course the chocolate chips with the pumpkin i used a dark chocolate chip um i used ghirardelli but you could use whatever flavor you wanted if you only had semi-sweet or um milk chocolate at home that would be fine too i just like the dark chocolate because of the antioxidant content and makes me feel good to have a little bit of dark chocolate for my heart health and for my name function okay so i think we're getting there with our soup i'm just gonna come over here and do some stirring um and one thing that we are going to use today is my immersion is an immersion blender and maybe you've had one or use one at home if you don't you don't have an immersion blender you could use a regular blender or your food processor what i like about using the immersion blender is i don't have to remove any of the liquid from the pot and that is much safer because it's very hot if you can hear it it's boiling right now and so if i can avoid having to pour something very hot into a blender and risk getting burned i'm going to do that sometimes what i'll do too if i didn't have my immersion blender is i actually might let the soup cool a little bit before i put it in the blender just so that i didn't risk any burns um so let's go ahead i'm going to plug this in and the immersion blender can go right into the pot i'm just going to blend up some of the um just kind of help to give it more of a creamy texture [Music] [Applause] [Music] now depending on how creamy you want it um you can continue to do a lot of the blending if you don't mind or maybe you like soup that has a little bit more chunkiness to it you could leave some of these apples um chunky i'm gonna just do a little bit more blending [Music] okay so that looks pretty good i'm going to just put this to the side and if i want to i can blend it some more i'm going to add a couple other things the first thing i want to do is i'm going to add some coconut milk one recommendation i have is when you use coconut milk make sure you shake the can really well what happens is some of this the coconut extract starts to settle at the very bottom and so if you don't shake it you'll get more of water on the top when you pour it out you could also use an evaporated milk or you could use a half and half i just really enjoy the coconut flavor with the curry so that's why i chose to use the coconut milk but again if you don't care for coconut you could um just use some half and half or evaporated milk probably even just some regular milk as well this is just going to give it a little bit more creaminess so you can see on the lid of my coconut you can see where some of that coconut residue is and so it's good that i shook it to try and get it mixed up a little bit more so it calls for about one cup i'm using a measuring cup that's specific to liquids a little too much in there here we go now now after making this i'm going to have a half a can of coconut milk left and so what i will do is i'll make sure to put it into a mason jar and i'll label it and then the rest of the week i'll think of some different ways that i can use the rest of that coconut milk whether i make some type of coconut rice or some type of curried stir fry or something to use the coconut milk you could however if you wanted to you could put it in the freezer and freeze it in a freezer safe container and then take it out when you want to use it again making sure you're not wasting anything and you're using whatever you have all right so i think this might need one more little blending here so forgive me [Music] okay all right so the last thing we want to do is just kind of we want to taste it just to see if it needs some salt and pepper so i'm going to take a little bit out on a clean spoon and i'll let it dry or cool a little bit that's actually really good and i actually think the salt profile is great i'm going to add a little bit of prep pepper and i should say that um i did salt and pepper i think i did say this but i salt and peppered the butternut squash when i cooked it and so that's also adding some salt and pepper to it as well okay and then i'd love to serve this with a couple different garnishes the first garnish i like to use is some cashews also during this time of the year when i am roasting pumpkin seeds roasted pumpkin seeds are excellent on this soup as well so let's get out a little bit of this all right so we've got i don't want to spill it but i want you to be able to see the color a little bit here um so i'm going to add a couple cashews um and cashews again are a good source of unsaturated fats they tend to have more fat in them than some of the other nuts but they're they're absolutely delicious and then finally i like to add some green parsley to this as well parsley is a great source of potassium which is helps to maintain our blood pressure [Music] it's got some fiber in it and other vitamins and minerals as well so if you can garnish with some items that actually give you nutrients then that is wonderful as well and i just used a flat italian parsley so let's review what we made today we um created a pear bell and um red onion which we we kind of pickled with red red wine vinegar i should say that red wine vinegar and my red onions that'll keep in the refrigerator for several weeks so you can use it up over the course of time we added some toasted pecans and then some fresh local pears i could also have added some apple to this or skipped the pear and added the apple we also made a ginger butternut squash soup so we use fresh ginger we roasted some butternut squash um and then added a little bit of coconut to give it body and a little bit of nice flavor and then finally we made some mini pumpkin chocolate chip muffins um and the pumpkin in here it increases the vitamin content the vitamin c in it some extra fiber it gives it a nice pretty brown color we use some whole wheat pastry flour but we also added it in some yummy chocolate chips so i hope you have seen at least one recipe here that you would love to try at home again this looks like an amazing harvest meal fall is one of my favorite times of the year and also my kitchen doesn't feel as hot when i cook so i always appreciate that so i wanted to thank you for joining me here today i will be back next week and we'll be cooking up another fall harvest meal so until then be well and take care thank you", "qZpYoyAK7o4": "[Music] hi this is becky nunn with nunn design and I'm a guest designer with beadaholique I'd like to show you how you can create sculpted resin pieces like in these samples here to do this technique you'll want to have the following tools and ingredients I have a two-part silicon putty I've already pinched off equal sized balls I have the Nunn design two-part resin it's already pre-mixed I have a couple of different mica powders or you can use casting crap color pigments this is what we're going to use to colorize the resin and then a couple stir sticks and q-tips we also have some Nunn design open back bezel and for this particular project I'm going to show you how you can use organics to create your sculpted resin let me show you why this technique is so awesome when I was playing around with creating molds I was creating molds and then casting the pieces and then it was challenging to figure out where I wanted to use those pieces unless I wanted to drill them or attach them somehow into an undesigned bezel and in this case I used two part resin underneath and then stuck this piece on the top then I thought well wouldn't it be neat if you could actually create a mold and then put the bezel right into that mold and then pour the resin and therefore coming out with a piece that you didn't need to attach it was already built in and that's how the idea of creating this technique came about so let me show you how to do that you're going to pinch off equal size balls of the silicon putty but before you mix that because you have such a small window to do so you want to make sure that you're all set up with what it is that you want to have your design be and so I'm using one of these open back bezel zuv Nunn design and we have a variety of open back bezel this particular one is a cast piece and these are actually brass pieces the pieces that are brass these can be used over and over and over again once you press that in there because they are precision made so every single piece will be exactly the same dimensions and therefore when you press it into that molding putty there won't be any leakage out of the sides versus a piece like this this is cast and then it's plated and it goes through a process where it can be easily dinged and marred so once you press this into your putty and then you want to make another one use it into the next mold you might have some seepage out the sides because this isn't precision hope you followed me there but that's the best way I can explain it you'll know because I agree what I'm talking about if you ever have any resin leaked out the sides it will be because it's a cast piece so let's go ahead and get started on this so I have a couple of pieces of organics that I've already trimmed out and thought about like how do I want those to be laid out with inside of my piece and it's important to have a really clear idea of what you want to do inside that piece before you mix up the silicon putty you have literally one minute minute and a half to work with this before it starts to harden and it no longer will take an impression so you want to be prepared so I have my design I'm also going to have out a piece of a card stock to work on and then I'll also use a little bag to place my putty on just so it doesn't stick to the surface of my work area alright so now I'm ready so I have equal size balls these were balls and they've kind of just morphed down into puddles you're going to mix these two parts until they are no long grrrrrr marbled so I like to use the palms of my hand and just move the putty back and forth until it's no longer marbled once it looks like it's pretty mixed a little bit more to go you're going to roll it into a nice smooth round ball and see how I'm using the palms of my hands kind of arching my fingers back gives me a nice flat surface to work with so now I have a nice ball and this is the container of the silicon putty I'm just using that to flatten down and make a nice little patty you want to have enough of the putty or a big enough shape to fit that bezel so I'll squeeze it down a little bit more now I have a nice flat putty and I'm going to place my bezel in and press down gently and then I'm going to take my little organics actually I like it just like that and you're going to press that down into the putty and if you need to you can go in with a toothpick and just gently press it down into the molding putty then you're going to let that set and it will take it'll set pretty much in about let's see five minutes that will be probably ready these pieces here I actually used a real nautilus for that and this was a brass stamping but you can see that the same process was done with creating this mold here press my brass stamping in I actually took the brass stamping out and then pressed in this afterwards now let that set up for just a little bit and then we'll go ahead and work with the mold while you're letting your silicon putty set up you can start thinking about how you want to do your design in this example I think what I'd like to do is I'll use a gold pearl X mica powder to go into the base where the flowers now are and then I think I'll go ahead and then pour into the bezel some mixed resin with this color of mica powder I have no idea what this is going to look like so we're just going to have to go with it so I've already mixed some Nunn design resin this is the Nunn design two-part resin and I'm going ahead and placing in a little bit of mica powders into that clear resin and stirring this up this is already getting pretty thick but I think this will hopefully still work just giving it a fun sort of you're a decent teal color now we're going to set that aside let's take a look at how we're doing with our our putty and now this is very firm to the touch so I can go ahead and come in I'm going to leave that bezel in its position because like I mentioned that is it's this molding putty example is designed specifically to go with this particular bezel and I'm just going to remove my little bit of organics that were in there now you can see my impression in there I'm just super curious to see what that's going to look like when the resin hits it so I mixed up a little bit of two-part epoxy clay and you could do this with playdough or something else but I just kind of want to see what that design is going to look like that's pretty interesting if I didn't like that or if this mold didn't look interesting I could go ahead and and start another impression but that looks kind of that looks like it could be really neat so the next step of what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the mica powders and a q-tip and I'm going to go into the base of this and just smear some around so that I can get some really good highlights down in those recessed areas and actually it might like kind of cool if I just have the whole thing kind of covered like such and then just tap it to get any of the excess mica powders out now with our colorized mica powder wow this is getting thick we're going to go ahead and drizzle some down into the base of our bezel all right before I get too much in there I'm going to stop and use my toothpick to move that resin around inside of there I'm also going along the side edges to make sure that I don't have any air pockets and then you're going to let that set until heart it takes about 12 hours for that to get really hard if you want you can go along side edge if you have any excess resin on the side and clean that up then once that is all ready this is when I did earlier on this I mixed up some black crafting casting craft opaque pigments in with my clear resin and I had gold mica powder on the base and then when you were done you come in and you peel back you side edges and your piece will pop out this is pretty interesting but you can see that I had some right here on my organics that's kind of a little bit funky if I wanted to I could put another coat of clear resin over the top of that to give it an interesting look and it would fill in that little hole right there but that's pretty pretty neat as it is when I was talking about earlier how sometimes the resin can seep out this is in another example of a cast piece versus a precision brass piece and I poured in a little bit of the clear resin and I could see that it was sliding out the top out of the bottom so I just stopped and let that piece cure it fully cured and you can see it had a really cool effect where it's has like a partial coverage and then this also had it and I just filled in additional I put tape at the back of this and just put additional resin over the top to create that really interesting funky look I mean I love it bubbles and all it just it just looks so unusual and that was kind of a fun expert ory play but really figuring out why was it seeping out of the side on some and not others really came down to the fact that these were cast pieces and you can see that it does involve some cleanup and this just takes a pair of needle nose pliers to kind of pick out this and then it peels off but this technique works it just requires more cleanup than if you were using a brass precision piece though this is becky nunn showing you how you can create a sculpted resin piece using organics or you can use brass stampings you can use colorized resin or you can use mica powders to create really interesting pieces thanks for joining me you", "vb-1zwTze7c": "what is up youtube this is live pack john and as you can tell by the title we're gonna be talking about what is the delta h high life and we have some delta h crumble here that i've been dabbing on so before we get into this video and talk about what the high's been like for me i'm gonna take another dab to get the high going at this point in the video if you don't know like subscribe comment this is when we like to take dabs so like i said you don't know what we do during this time of the video we subscribe we comment where we from kind of what y'all smoking on that's what i want y'all to do you know what i'm saying let me know what y'all smoking on right now we smoking awesome delta eight crumble you know i'm saying confused that my uh my homies got for me uh he's extracted you know what i'm saying so a little eager to talk about what my experience has been like dabbing on this couple grams of this [ __ ] it's not gonna be a really loud music video because like i said it's gonna be more talking so i'm gonna take a fat dab of this [ __ ] here we go y'all cheers foreign the delta eight really get you high yes and no is it the full [ __ ] up you know what i'm saying incoherent high you're going to be used to no but it's almost like cbd with a kick that's the way i describe the feel of it and for states that's not legal and it's absolutely a uh heaven said because you can have delta eight and plenty of state that you can't have um thc you know the full delta nine thc now this is going to be different than delta nine obviously the high's gonna be a slight bit different it's not the exact same molecule that's real that's and they are mimicking an anatomized in your brain so i could go on a whole nother lecture about or talk about how delta eight differs from delta nine in the actual molecule structure but nonetheless we're talking about the actual high of this [ __ ] i'm not here to give you guys a [ __ ] science speech the higher the [ __ ] is definitely a little more mellow it's gonna be a little bit you're still getting possible munchies from i still get the munchies from it um so i will say that it's still good like you need to get to sleep or like you know what i'm saying [ __ ] like that but it's in my opinion as a stoner it's not a long lasting um it's not that kind of smacking in the face i can function off this [ __ ] perfectly fine even in a nerve-wracking situation that doesn't increase my anxiety that's one thing i like about delta 8. um yeah i mean it still will have you stoned out in some moments because i mean at least for me i still mix my my regular dabs too i also got a good clear one like a day or so just dabbing that just to see what it was like and it wasn't quite as much of a punch pack to it but it got enough of the job done and if i had smoked a high quantity of it i imagine i could have gotten relatively you know inebriated that's my view on delta eight let me know in the comments what you guys experience are with delta eight uh you know whether you have i'm going to be getting cartridges also to show you guys delta cartridges they've had them up here for a while um i never picked one up but i always kind of looked at it kind of like cbd like one of those things but it might be wasting my money because it's not going to get me high and high like what am i smoking it for about obama you know but this it's definitely better than cbd in terms of like could i see myself some dabbing on that more often like yeah hell yeah price wise that's the thing for me it was a little bit more expensive and i like to pay for that quality so i wouldn't probably purchase it again um you guys probably see i put my [ __ ] shirt on inside out and backwards whatever the [ __ ] up inside here excuse my stonedness and you guys are going to comment on that [ __ ] probably yeah i'm just going off on a ramble i appreciate you all if you've been watching me at this point i genuinely appreciate each and every one of you that tunes in to any video any and all videos i don't get a million views but i get some people that watch so i'm happy that people actually want to listen to something what i have to say and i'm genuinely grateful for each and everybody that hits that subscribe button or anybody that turns any you cannot subscribe we're gonna go on another dab awesome i would say incredible let me know what you dabbing on in the comment section like i said blunt bull joint what strain glue og cookies let me know what you smoking on you know some vape pen dabbing whatever how the [ __ ] is you getting high i'm trying to scrape this [ __ ] out [ __ ] at all all right joe i'm going in honor knocking [ __ ] down cheers y'all um god zombies ah i think i'm gonna make this video starting to review delta eight huh this been loud pack john i appreciate y'all tuning in like i said stay up y'all", "-IE7sKSj2jk":

titles and you know what you clicked on you're about to get up into the ziddles cake you're not saying fire strain but now before we get up into the ziddle's cake like i said in my previous videos in all my videos there will be a shout out you know i'm saying we'll be shouting out anybody that comments down in any one of my videos you know i'm saying so today's shout out goes to heaven since smoking channel i'm saying you know i'm saying he commented on some of my videos you know what i'm saying really you know motivates me to keep going nice and i'm saying comment nice things and i'm saying go check go check out he has his own youtube channel go check out heaven since smoking channel you know what i'm gonna plug it in the description i'm saying go check out his channel you know i'm saying dope channel you know i'm saying you do shadow reviews wax reviews cartridges reviews vape reviews and i'm saying just a dope ass chilling he's a dope ass dude and i'm saying go check him out but now we're about to get up into this ziddle you're not saying so grab your bowls your blunts your bongs your dab rigs you know i'm saying your pens you you know i'm saying anything that you're about to smoke on your joint whatever come smoke with me while we talk about this zittle's cake eyes or burnt i would be honest i didn't know zil's cake was a thing now i'm saying but it was bound to be a thing because you know what i'm saying it's ziddles cross with wedding cake now i'm saying ziddles is a dope ass string and i'm saying ziddles is i think i think that's what makes up rocks or something like that but ziddles when you get some zittles you know i'm saying expect fruity flavors coming out you know i'm saying on the inhale when you bust open the bag you know what i'm saying and when you smoke it you're gonna get that fruity berry earthy taste you know i'm saying some little cake like i said is zillow's cross with wedding cake and i'm saying it is a 70 30 indica dominant hybrid so we spoke to zebras cake there's a possibility you might get a little bit of that sativa buzz but most definitely you're gonna get that indica buzz i'm telling you you're gonna get that indica buzz you know i'm saying taste like i said very very fruity very like berry like you know i'm saying very earthy and i'm saying i love strange that you know tastes great you're not saying who wants to smoke some boo-boo to fool last week you know what i'm saying i want none of that i don't want no swag no i'm saying you don't want none of that i don't want no damn weed you know what i'm saying but now so this cake definitely a dope ass string i'm going to show you guys a couple clips i'm not saying of the zittles i got it not saying it i'm remind you guys it is a little it is a little crunchy you know what i'm saying it's a little crunchy this batch is it was cake it was a little it was a little bit on the dry side but definitely it's some dope this is a dope straining i'm saying it's my first time smoking it you know i'm saying yesterday was my first time actually really smoking it and then today so it's like it's a dope ass train man really recommend you know some ziddles cake you know i'm saying if you could find it definitely get it but yes it was cake you know what i'm saying nice little bit on the like not darker green but like on the darker green side you know i'm saying with the purple hues definitely you know a little frosty up in there it's just a dope strange little cake if you can definitely get your hands on it definitely try it out or even if you want this this little cake is not it's not zoodles it's not half and half it's not mixed strange you know i'm saying this is one strain you know i'm saying zippers cake it's not input ziddles and then wedding cake in the blunt and then no it's one strange so but even if you do guys mix it up like that get you some zittles and you got some wedding cake and i'm saying mix them up and put a little blood bet you feel good but like i said in all my videos i do rape the strain reviews product reviews anything along that nature in a one in a zero to five fashion so this ziddle's cake coming out of that strong 4.2 coming in at a strong 4.2 it's a dope strain i haven't seen too many people with zidane's cake now i've seen i've seen a couple but not too many people no i'm saying it's a dope strain dope indica dominant higher high indica dominant hybrid strain i'm saying i'm more of an indica dominant now so i'm not really a sativa person i am but i'm not you know what i'm saying i love my indicas but like i said on the taste on the smell you're definitely getting the earthy the sweets on the taste you're definitely going to get that sweet berry and then once you exhale you're getting that gassy aroma and i'm saying on the looks you know i'm seeing nice nice strikeout buds you know i'm saying like i said mom's on the crunchy side but it's all cool um i did rehydrate it a little bit and i'm saying but um now i'm saying it looks good you know i'm saying purple hues up in there and then like i said it's just a dope strain you know i'm saying you can get your hands on some ziddles cake definitely get your hands on some zittlescape but for the next one guys", "RKfb0yKG9i4": "[Music] [Music] all night go hard shine [Music] Oh not a shot British I think it was notary

more topic that is narration okay so it just celebration goes on this topic I think the help you to the computer examples ok so the first person first person so the moment of inertia are flying with having the kind of energy 362 - speed 20 Radian per second of experimental person any energy so it's always half I Omega square divided by energy this is 360 job is it is nice or not we want to find out I like you one time discrete that is 20 square so 3/16 this is dg2 - so I need is a key to 20 squared is 400 so 720 by 480 go too high so I was equal to I is equal to some predicted by four I am the financier the financier is 1.8 1.8 kg meter squared so this is the option option key and the next person in absence of Excel table so according divine power exists which quantity remains constant okay so they say F is equal to 0 I for instance you can energy implementer and I know that makes up okay so we don't have any relation with the linear momentum with respect to that thought mercifully has a relation between a target and a freedom that is tau is equal to VN y DV is equal to zero infer that tau is equal to zero so was it up here the difference is how I am moving them is the angle itself means that the difference in each term we wanted to differentiate it is zero it is constant so a physical constant what the area I have momentum so the option for angular momentum is correct okay the next question every they will both the weight of inertia is 2 kg meter square has each angle velocity protonating per second a constant of the Fig Newton meter acts on the quick estimate the time in which the wheel is accelerated to 80 Radian per second okay what are you with them so thank you the movement of inertia fiber we 2 kg meter square okay and thank you 1 the initial angular velocity I have Omega for the initial and it's a reason to be reinforced again 58 per second okay I don't wanna step doctor so an external darkest active on that green and it's very sad Thank You 10-meter okay this extra tartar the velocity diversity to heal per second we did again positive if so if so estimate the time in which it is accelerated to 80 so to reach from to restate opinion so it is a constant thing to restating how much time it takes for the self question okay so find the equation for rotational motion that is Omega is equal to Omega naught plus not party it is say how that how we equal to V now just aim to be V is going to be not less than 80 this is I think what so maybe the final value et et cetera 50 plus I which even you don't know so to calculate the value of alpha they have given that given the kg meter square so what is that it is moment of inertia okay what that curve so we now tom is equal to I think completely each and health promotion with a linear motion so that deaf people do you mean alpha okay alpha so my second elimination so the Y Delta Y is 10 degrees on this is 2 so our y is equal to 5 Radian per second straight Radian per second straight that is fine okay I do fire us all the way up on top which is fine okay and then UT minus 15 this is 30 and finally then T is equal to 32 by 5 so E is equal to 6 seconds so this is our answer okay here the offset to off number two is the answer type 6 again for super fire a circular is roast um and in fact the ratio of rotation of any container total energy there's a separately in Blancpain okay I necessary planet is the sector is high it is rolling down around us and he quietly okay so say Y is rolling no it is higher than 220 energy one is third exit kinetic energy so in action to the original story the Linea depending on dancing so the following energy so this is one by two young big square I accept any energy the rotational kinetic energy so it is equal to 1 I 2 I Omega Square 1 by 2 I Omega squared okay so there it is the circular disc so da by this we can get there is a moment of inertia and was a moment of inertia for a circular disc this is a master fighter right this is young aspect but - okay I know make a value Omega we know the relation to V is equal to I Omega I wonder I never become this would be be back okay subsidies when K is equal to 1 by 2 this is the unclasp it by 2 into Omega instead of Omega updated we must be square Phi Hospital so catalog okay now this Aspen and the suspect cancer so R is equal to K is equal to 1 over 200 to look for young miss with this is a protestor tiny and I think I want to prevent ending energy now so I thought this is a KP this is organic completing a totem so that will be taken christina was at the end this is how young we squared was it young whispered okay so 1 by 2 plus 1 by 4 1 by 2 plus 1 network and you misplace comment Navigator 3 by 4 young Reese quit okay this is rotation penny-ante yeah that is all there is also key location to them yeah open here for them is equal to so what we get is 3 by 4 young this is totally ok so the kinetic energy T are no idea he was a haircut this is 1 by 4 young miss with and what order the total this is 3 by 4 young we swear okay either the ratio 1 by 4 mu square 3 by 4 M is with for the full for handsome man's is one man thing so option two this is thanks okay next question well since if the radius of contact 2 percent is mass remains same then the weight of the body is but Waitaha body so the formula particular term yummy G mass integration Gabi so whatever we the place so the masa remains constant okay so as the our contacts so what are the cheapest so this is G camp that has been exaggerating that young services GM my aspect is it okay so it's a decrease in contact are anything after the earth being round ice cream I'm awake other a statement about as the radius decreases other is decreases use accessibility increases as I what about the vapor wake up synthesis because is tactical significantly okay I can give that listen the blue proportional to G he must be the central aspect so as a states meet Santa Cruz's business and debating this is so this is option but to tell great with increased on the surface before the radius I decrease it okay the next person see ya okay question was seven I think why Afghan yelled and mask young is been in the form of semicircular as shown in the figure what would be its moment of inertia our an axis like job of rnases Chinese feelings okay so the wire and it is been in the form of a semicircle I started to rotate it on the side it will rotate it about an axis so which connects those two three hands okay access is like offering happening so we know who made up inertia for every hour and exist passing so this is young ass with your bike - young master vector is a moment of inertia our dream okay so one can take this one so we need the mind of the path so we don't know what we don't the size of this can be said that this is length so this is awesome so it's too bad every set complete cycle - very simply by then is equal to number so now R is equal to yell back fight I think this is OK yes my quiet so that is equal to again as it is so what is odd when it is yell divided by 5 by 5 whole square by 2 so I is equal to young yes square either the denominator by square I do so x is better back to face with the optional for is answer option for both designs again mr. Coopersmith okay next - climaxes two planets are wheel distance dividend p2 from the Sun and their frequencies are you know I came to respect it was a frequency the number of rotations in a given time interval okay those are that is n1 and n2 right if so so which are the for elimination Falls good and you know that you gonna do you papa it's a semi-major axis okay so I need exactly proportional to their distance the segment exists a Christian okay now I write T squared by R cubed is equal to constant is equal to constant so T 1 square R 1 cube is equal to so the same vegetables good for the second time also and goes to equal the ratio of the speed of light period to tell you what with sandwich Isis is same for all the planet okay next one so this is a paint way they are p1 n1 and n2 what are they going to get when I came to our frequencies so of the people since the time period we know is equal to 1 by X or 1 by can do one yen as a frequency so instead of writing t1 I like that one by M okay that would be whatever I want you as it is so it should have given already n1 squared and here instead of people where they turn into a Nixon square then r2 cube okay Thank You Oscar vacation ru q n2 square is equal to R 1 to N 1 square and C which is a correct option okay option F of 1 so u m2 square d 2 cube then 2 squared if you forget we should have one more thing instead after that they give the distance thing so instead of all right D so that is d 1 cube yet use p12 sorry we took you into square kinda d1 q get your squares of the option option first so this is the correct answer next make sure the Knights move I know minimum distance of comment from the sun-eater meter and 1.62 telephoto which other maximum distance is a treaty that what we noticed is the 1.6 if it's velocity when nearness to the Sun is 60 feet per second and that what will be is velocity it will per second when it is a fartist okay so coming to Queens and commenting okay so it is the body around the Sun and it's the system thank you so this is does then it is the body changes so it is a closest distance I call this as first position is the largest distance I call this is a second question okay the closest distance that is 1.6 meter was 1.6 into 10 to power and another system which is 82 in a right angle the velocity is position this is 60 meter per second icon this is women so we do is equal to question mark which is pushing man okay how to solve this one how to solve this one so for any body in extra particular rotation motion so it may Pizza the constant angular momentum either let's go sir in the state capital ok ok ok ok ok so ok 6 into 2 this is V 2 is equal to 12 meter per second which is equal to 1 meter per second option 3 of 3 which is okay if a particle of mass M is thrown upward from the surface of Earth with a velocity U with a velocity u velocity u the mass and radius of the earth so young and capital R is a full point next G is the gravity constant I spawn things I can see the character on the surface of Earth estimate the mean available to you with a video kind of speed so that the Python doesn't return back to the earth it will calculate initial velocity initial speed which we did stone so that if you are a tester for that means I gotta escape speed because that as I escapes with another call about escape sweet idea for a same screen now you get straight for this project it is you usually write that if you need and the fountains and the quantize we can write to GM L by 2 GM time so this is our formula so they asked me the same thing what is the wine of any shirts watching the white up initial speed so that the more in evidence enough is nothing but the as a speed value so that is 2 g-m by r so object to root of 2 G by r this is the correct answer you may confuse now check to TR spend it will be right so become director excuse me thumbs up gr so small cancel that we broke up to Gia but here the tub is square so it may confuse you so go to the option to root of 2 G my ah nice person thank you the center of mass of a triangle as shown in the figure has coiling is okay so we should get the coordinates alpha center of mass so you want to get the center where the center of mass okay I am to this Exodus and this is why I am for this descent from here to here so this okay sunlight is an H and from the immediate decision be okay so to solve this one I assume as you there are three particles of equal masses three particles are of equal masses at the Kanazawa that triangle okay first particle this is second Monica and this is third particle okay so the first particle so what are the what is here C is the origin I think this is 0 comma 0 0 comma 0 so X you know I this 0 T so far - so this is the second one so it is having the extra when you have Y minus 0 side vector V I cap plus 0 Jacob I thought after coding modified either he's having a Y value but 0 along x axis so 0 I plus C is it ok so what about you we wanna send off for next our center of mass so I write R of C is equal to another formula + M two R 2 plus n 3 agree with the recommendations there by M 1 plus M 2 plus M 3 ok something this way I had a little bias between the particles are of equal masses so I think a more equal to M 3 put in 3 for 6 p.m. subject young and all the mass terms okay next I ask CF is equal to the first step I'm going to add 1 is 0 so nobody practice 1 so this is 0 I am - I am - it is young I - I see a card over P into high so be I got a zero - don't need to write this 1 plus yup they do hardly young team is young yeah more equal to M to the N power equals am only so happy very so no extraordinary so there will be wipin exit so young we come yet Jacob yes Jacob filtered by Yamaha Willingham okay next one awesome awesome is equal to is equal to young widow be I kept the scam we do yet Jacob but I am I am common yet they are common in the numerator that will be VI cap yet Jacob by 3m cancer so here this will be V I cap chain sorry yet Jacob thereby clean so you can also write it as a B by 3 I cap plus h by 3 Jacob okay so what are the coordinates we might think we finance my V by Del X exists and H by Del Y exists so the center of mass is having the coordinates be PI 3 and object one is correct next one so is a statement that at first it means second one top is equal to rate of change of angular momentum obviously Ray is equal to because in America expect so 12 is equal to 12 is equal to DN by DT okay second one I'm not the victim depends upon the moment of inertia as well as velocity is equal to I Omega moment of inertia I am the velocity so the stupid one is correct as it went to be is also correct okay then which are thousands this correct okay so stigma of Jennifer to both the statement one hand scanner - ah - but the statement - is not correct expression of statement one so both are correct but they don't have any relation between them so that's why we have to go for the second option even though they are true character but that is relate to okay second statement is not explanation alpha the first one is it so that's what option - next question question okay three rings how the mass young and radius R is as shown in the figure the moment of inertia the moment of inertia of the system about why why - see this is a one ring and the ring second week and curving okay for the first ring so I write here so this is first thing is the second the entering this is my life why am I so with ready okay for the first one but first one we can say the moment of inertia about an axis passing through its diameter passing through its diameter so that will be 1 by 2 gamma strip ok see that I got that can be 1 by 2 gamma squared 1 by 2 m as well item 4 the second I turn so what about this sir like this operation so that we can take the pilot to the diameter that by giving it that make a family event so for this case we know the formula that will be 3 by 2 gamma square 3 by 2 VA hospital and a third one for this also it is tangential the tangential axis we decide this operation I need this parallel film that I meter it is 3 by 2 Yamaha squid they bite a master so that be nice and easy let's cycle that's 19 so next is equal to so this is 1 by 2 n minus 2 it and next one is 3 by 3 a mosque with I service is also 3 by 3 a mass spec okay so young aspect is momentum and their denominators - okay so then 1 plus 3 plus 3 so finally this is 7 by 2 young aspect so this is the moment of inertia and care system object first is her next question the new indefinite stop after things great plated abs baby up in some thickness our an axis passing through the center oh and perpendicular to the plane so is very far in twenty years and that is a deal with the Sun this one oh I see yeah this is the first axis this is I can take this further exist and contact this tie given that means one to take over for those existence but imperfectly the existed so was apical meristem the moment of inertia about a particular exists for example this is so if it is a big but you know that wind so this is that particular axis now the max amount of carbon exists is equal to is equal to the sum of moment of inertia the sum of moment of inertia of also about the coping up perpendicular exists for example for example so this is the z axis and this is X and this and this is why this sicko on the keto moment of madness which is perpendicular to the which is perpendicular to both of Y and X so you later I accept and I like I said which is perpendicular to x and y is equal to some alpha is that we need to retrace perpendicular coconut exists so why haystack same plane that is perpendicular so that the sum of these two is equal to the weight of inertia of the perfect Alexis okay if so I have seen this is I think so correct and this is the full Texas this is the fourth exist okay I think both are perpendicular to each other before we get to the without finish yeah but particularly this thing so that between the sum of moment of inertia about that don't exist and about this whole thing is I can write an ice core type thickness I hope okay next up make sure we can take that too one more thing that isn't this one I won and uh there's a one more this is to answer this one at least one this one eigenvector the Mona Lisa for the perfect length this is equal to tow is equal to MU beta of inertia about the first exist a point of any support the second agrees this chorus of operating each other okay and also and also we can take who can take okay by this say i1 equal to i2 equal to I think equal to - the song ready to exist the moment after national about them - I would need to exist will be safe so wait a minute shall perpendicular to this square is equal to i1 minocycline and I think this might work - I do all are correct so that's how we can write option is a possibility 1 the radius of panic is 1/4 out radius of 1 per race of birth is exaggerated that means the mother of all suggested grantee how many times would escape velocity and applying surface B as compared to its final on earth surface okay first we'll see let's get speed V is equal to root 2 G okay so my question put it that way so there's a one more planet there is a one more thank you this is one more planning it's a radius is radius RP is 1/4 of all various I have okay and they say that stability on the surface Titan is twice that alpha is double alpha so in this empty so that's like 1 times that would be you see they escape velocity on that connection is equal to is equal to the radius is you to Gabi's to G or and I get GRP and RP okay so this is 2 CP value this is like this I have it is a 1/4 alpha is a 1/4 of that I guess of Earth so makes them 2 into 2 4 and then our next one this one is one cancer so this will be Gina so this is geography is it I we now we now we either equal to Gia okay I can either we use accordion is it here okay now we can write up as a spread on the what is equal to 2 theta SS speed on the planet so whatever Ksenia you should compare the speed off planet so it will be hazardous if the velocities and an episode of the design this would be we flew so the excuse we have the connection let's guess we on the planet is 1 by 2 pi place is speed on the earth so this is enough time okay so this is fine sir okay which are famous kite third one so 1 by root 2 is a correct answer nice 23 if jinx proposal to argue instead of a square then the relation between the time period of the satellite near the surface and Vegas with me in fact is the radius okay so if so if so by having by having the term that is imposed is equal to GM the mass of that body mass of a square so it is true but the case here they are saying if that jeez he was the proportional to u alpha that radius so what would be the time period what would be the time period I was a little time and radius okay in this case we know the nation we know the relation TNR that is T Square proposal to argue so this Allah true but here the situation is different suppose as you eat that G is USD per person to cube of the radius keep up the radius okay see the centripetal force of a satellite so that should be correct mechanism moves up that satellite let us suppose on that satellite okay and this here this is young askwith Omega okay yeah aspect Omega and aggressive moves its G to mass of the body mass of satellite it's a radius its radius q why am taking this as a cube because as as you mean the G diversity percent to pro-q mouth that means if so here young people young fella do you feel so if it is PI R square so they suspect it is argue it is a are you okay thirsty then so young a straight side this is young miss with the Central Coast I want to read three value in terms of I know has wide rectangular states because we want to take that either Omega T by back to PI by T so whatever did we end up I have a love scene so young as it is I never see this is omega squared over R is equal to G mmm okay are you now this master and the master cancer okay aspect Omega square ha ha ha - ha ha equal to GM go by I 2 g-m by r cube and here this is and this okay what else yeah already many times so is simple ah I Omega square directly okay my name is canceling idea this is GM the river are you okay I know make a square Omega square Omega square and I put my I think closely and I think this I this side this is VMware time I do business and one more on this become hard to the power 4 okay I see the phenomena okay this is 4 PI square by T squared 4 PI squared over a squared is equal to GM over R to the power 4 so this is between P and R so we can write is where propose to know R to the power 4 and these proposed vector R square so this is that nation by G is because we purpose alone cube of the radius okay if you go straight up together this is our case if you see you off radius and this aspectus okay next question push number 24 the mean radius of Earth is ah ok triangle sweet on its own axis is omega and the fact that Thank You hopefully a sample or becomes useless release at night okay so that is the body the UM the blood and I think it's a radius from the center part is smaller or I can say it's a distance is smaller okay is weak with our eye mask R Omega then the Josephine second also must move with behind our speed Omega then it becomes zero system okay and here so what ask me so they see the cube of radius of hot region and sit option that in terms of Omega Omega behind our speed okay so what's our that Street first so this is artistry is equal to GM certified so this segment from the earth and capital R is radius since alpha we can write R into Omega V is equal to I Omega Rho Omega is equal to is equal to GM 35 okay then Omega is equal to Omega is equal to 1 by half I took this year 1 Baja Geum okay thank you inside the school so what happens for GM as it is so if I take in meknes husband and what Alex did so Hixton Omega is equal to Omega squared under broken ji-yong so exactly 100 since 2 p.m. we can take the aspect so G R squared divided by G R script I okay let's break that up so Omega squared is equal to the square of cancers gr square thank you - I wonder why come up the cube R radius our justice Alicia claims is exactly dissidence more than that 6 cubed R cube so a cube is equal to G R square as it is just as it is third by Omega square no by Omega square so this is G R squared G R squared over Omega squared times R option number two or number two is a correct answer next course number 25 if the column is treated as a sphere of radius R my master is it's all about that separation with a bank safe with them so this is the I Omega okay I only take at this equation I Omega because the things now since an example we have a square must be like this Visia MOSFET is something related to the moment of inertia so we have inertia of a solid sphere is considered to be a solid sphere is bioethics but is to fight for you young master to backfire yeah Oscar I don't make how I do this is 2 pi by T so yeah equal to I Omega is 2 pi for you young a square okay and Omega by 2 pi by T okay next up 2 into 2 4 2 into 2 4 5 and this is 5 this is 5 and y are dirty and this is young Aspen so this is times ax so which on this that 4.0 MOSFET where were fighting over Yamazaki option one is correct make sure if our slot Athena's that stems between the Sun and the earth that I'm out of the cell corresponding to I don't know meter mouths and cats for me too so why not make a little young to be ha ha for this we are still paper veena wasn't enough is done our pizza it is that orbitals in the span ok another we not saw sitting there is equal to yeah we don't yeah me too G go back from it's a dispenser from the Sun ok next one so I can write it as it is root of GM goodbye I take it I right now separately with the spirit and this is ha ok yes Rudolph Geum axial applied and this is high so this can be written as a group not equal to each other about this wonderful cancer and internalize that so yeah is 94% ha ha is it clear second is I wrote ha ha ha cancer and this will be hard so now this is a conservative one root out so I come in zombies tactical personal spirit aha next question the total kinetic energy of us rolling solid sphere is the sum of fans nature as well as rotational energies yes it is true okay total kinetic energy is the sum of translational as well as rotational kinetic energy our attacks on you for every body for equality will be depending in each one is total rotation as putrid son Liam Omega bigger motion okay and a second it is true but what is true second one but all of what is the total energy some ways grace the translational kinetic energy so that same for other body the total intensity but for all the bodies total kinetic energy to the pending energy is always equal to time depending energy so it doesn't pull good for all the cases it doesn't the whole football the case it is possible is possible only for the hollow cylinder only for the hollow cylinder and although say the hang them in Safari and how versatile only the total came to be twice alpha plus alpha it's a translation tanking energy okay if they many cases if it will not be close so that's the second statement is wrong is not applicable for all other bodies is applicable only for the hollow Center entering so which of them is options which one a thousand suspect first one is true second one is false so statement one statement one is to participate through into his path option of a thing is correct statement right thanks so a 28 to point objects of 1.5 respectively at a distance of 16 centimeters apart the center of gravity is at a distance nice combo check alpha must 1.5 pounds but that X is okay so that is what is a mask 1.5 1.5 and is having tom\u00e1s 2.4 you grandma okay right then so yeah I think the sensor 16 that is a 16 sending each other then the center of gravity is a distance X from the one point for you so this is a system from existence and I sent a strategy center what the in existence 16 minus 6 the total distance is 16 sail away from here is an X so that's what we believe is 16 minus X okay we now have a center of gravity as we drop that way the movement of forces the moment of both of forces are equal so what the momentum for pizza is suppose up into that distance is force into distance so there are bodies so what this 11.50 mass in dough is excited regarding its own mass into acceleration into the distances at X is equal to here the mass is oh it's exit acidity into that distance is 60 minus F X now the g and g answer it is 1.5 x is equal to 2.5 yo into bracket 1 point 6 outside 16 centimeter so 16 minus and thanks okay so 1.5 as it is 2 point 4 into 16 so that will be 14 minus 2 point 5 into 8 that is 2 point 5 8 8 is minus 1 percent 2 point 5 minus ETA becomes person plus 1 point 5 this is 4 x equal to 14 then x equal to-- this is 10 centimeter okay now option is 3 it means the center of gravity is not a 10 meter distance from the one point for you gram body okay next we have previous [Music] exhibition of the eight Radian per second square is produced we need to do to the top so that the moment of inertia of the wheel is okay say initially initially because arranged with a constant angular velocity constant angular velocity okay when when rope with a mass of 4 kg is after on this wheel so there will be a force like this with the with the rotation so that is something to be done so with this start is starting to on exaggerated and that acceleration is a eight Radian per second square if so what moment of inertia okay so here we go through the con is equal to I alpha okay and also we know tau is equal to I don't yell and the sine theta so was a Takaya it items between them ah yes so this is the ha and this is the new effect of one here is angle is 90 DB sine of 90 is 1 so I clear what what you want the weather back so Texas I is equal to I so what is the radius its reaches this point four and what applied force applied force this is a breakfast I call this is mg effect for City on G alpha again that I do this is H is it okay and the next one next one 0.4 as it is young value mask it is full and initiate Liberty is taken to be 10 and this is page basically okay so next I get twenty five point four into thing this is four and one more for is then services per Bitcoin what I did Mississippi go back it is equal to heating meter square second Alpha Omega janessa so what idea we did we take the relation with respect to the force diagram the force and as you could get up going to finish up so this is the important concept next one push number 33 agree if we have movement of inertia - this is - teaching with the sperm above is vertical axes rotate at a rate of 60 rotations per minute and above this axis the top which can stop the wheel rates rotation in one make you would be okay so what a sexy rotation per minute it is the frequency thank you and the frequency okay frequencies 16 rotations per meter and sync yes I saw a sign even so that's what if you assign a rotation for me we should per second so 60 rotations and for me perfect a second one maybe a second sitcom is a 60 seconds so 60 rotate 17 62nd and I won the second place to Tehran is it one RPS was a happiest rotation four seconds is the frequency okay either what has he tasking the way of God to stop the wheel to stop the wheel okay so now this is equal to I having a fun time no but that we won the two ends one is near 1 is equal to 1/2 years and then you and Yahoo this is 0 why I'm taking we have tried to 0 we got there that wheels going to stop okay all right Omega 1 is equal to 2 pi just 1 so this is 2 pi into 1 minus 1 this is 2 pi I know that will be zero because it's worth it is going to stop so the final position is at rest Omega s Omega 2 is zero so I know alpha by 2 alpha that is final minus initial angle velocity by T okay final value 0 minus initial that is to go back time these does this say it stops up in one video so what maybe some 60 seconds so the answer is minus 2 pi divine 60 minus 2 pi by 60 is it ok and the next step is equal to I by this is - ok - alpha beta minus 2 pi by 16 I can write as minus pie by thirty so two idea is you connect you can cancel to exit see this is 5:30 with an accurate Asian so now so to enter D we can write minus five answer until you know there's no negative them so that I cannot tell so why I got to be kissing yeah because it is very tiny town so it is imposing term it is going there this thought is a stopping the motion so it's an opposite order to that protest motion that's what an increasing going exam so you neglect accent and go for the magnitude that is PI 550 option number 2 pi back you think you've done meter okay next question if strings such that it's math doesn't change but it is to one part of its question when then one complete it will be okay yeah so whether it is then the time for one day services becomes of us it also comes up so I think this has 24 hours 24 hours when I get up and see that said if the upstream state so what okay so then why should we then what should be the duration for one day okay so it's not this biasing now conservation of angular momentum okay so this is I 1 Omega 1 is I Omega okay so this is considered to be a sphere it is a sphere so that's fine it's a solid sphere has momentum inertia its moment of inertia is 2 by 5 young aspect the moment of inertia is 2 pi PI au yeung askwith okay so see ya or husband through my life as it is mass doesn't change as it is so initially this was so moving X X 2 by M aspect and what about the Omega one I bet is 2 pi by T 1 2 T 1 is equal to is equal to I 2 I so I 2 is the same thing 2 point 5 2 pi final mass as it is and it is changes from R to R by 4 and this term is in square I was Omega 2 to my self people so if this thing very distinct that light changes so the system so next time so 2 by 5 2 by 5 & 7 yum yum cancel so that it may come here this is a square and this to fight this took my cancel aspect defect even a scratch even here I have a square 2 by 4 square aspect also consistently cancer and a decision people ask us potential so take this to ratification and T 1 Omega 2 by the system and we know the time yes is hot so we take together 24 hours I know accessing if we simplify we got answer your answer 1.5 so T 2 is equal to 1.5 hours so what is this if the radius is raised to 1/4 of this present value that the duration for a day that would be 1.5 hours instead of 24 hours okay and the discussion goes over 37 taking the radius of Earth to be 6400 R equal to 6400 you know picture but what person so by what percentage with that acceleration because of character - tetrameter on the surface of Earth different from that on the surface of Earth so question again a system for anything so you are not acceleration to be guiding and incremental each other yesterday the if you come with if you compare that against you to that way and it will be done with a just look at the surface so what should be a positive vice should calculate this one so we know Texas will be tracking at a high temp it is equal to G to Berea is it gh is equal to G gamma phosphate this is a phosphate or you can write G H is a collision of TM I can write G Hospital time opposite poles but okay so this is alpha so G has it is another army no six of them 404 square they're like six thousand four hundred plus one hundred horses hundred the height and height a hundred so it's a square so gh is equal to G forget it $6,400 for a second the six thousand five hundred animals per square another okay so you can write the gh is equal to TX equal to C we do 6465 whole square all right so how to calculate the percentage change so we can calculate the change in X regarding the attention to that T so that is Delta G is equal to Delta G is equal to G minus G H so I G - yes because the my son as we call the cerveza decreases so next item a second change not a change in X indicating helped us a pitching so that is Delta G composite G we do 100 so the 50 G - G H don't buy G is 200 okay is equal to is equal to so G as it is - Ji Hyo so this is G into bracket 64 there were 65 4 squared divided by 4 Delta 5 ordered by G in 200 ok then I can take the gene outside common in writer I am degree term is 1 minus F 64 over 65 and the Nevada G hazardous GSD cancer I am screwed okay once X I so this is squid right so possibly now 1 minus f 64 over 64 go straight okay so if you simplify this one okay yeah so G has it easy so if I take the outside so it is 1 minus 64 over 6500 square okay my GP 200 now GG cancer so it means that you want my six people there were 64 whole square 64 65 positive if you 19200 so if we simplify this answer your answer nearly 3 so this is 3% so the object is a fourth one about 80% okay next we try to soften any questions you have any double you've got to my personal", "_jtbAhjgGwo": "so didn't you stop car back again DBA w is making baby shower in two units down good night today ahaha

glide on this one's not in guys and I'll go to pee shoutouts without beer and also be going talk and down via facebokk this video plugins now it will be gliding on the 1.8 grandmother these angles is", "3jm3DLv6Cks": "g'day welcome to todd's kitchen in the past i've made many different types of pizza crusts i've made normal pizza crusts i've made two ingredient pizza crusts i've made cauliflower pizza crust and this one's just as good and it's also pretty healthy too it's also keto friendly so join me today as make my version of coconut flour pizza crust now we're going to start with the main ingredient and that's our coconut flour so into a mixing bowl we're going to place in half a cup of coconut flour followed by two tablespoons of silicon husk then some salt a tablespoon of olive oil and one cup of warm water okay so firstly we're going to use a spoon and mix it up and then we're just going to get in there with our hands and knead it for about a minute just so it's all well combined if you find that's too dry add a little bit of water or if it's too wet just add a little bit more coconut flour okay so once it's relatively mixed like so just get in with our hands and we're just going to knead it for about a minute just so it's all combined and that's it that's all i have to do now i'm just going to put it all into one big ball and what we're going to do is we're just going to let this rest for about 10 minutes and that'll just give a chance for the silicon husk to absorb all that water so it'll dry out a bit but that's how you exactly how you want it so we get to a nice doughy consistency for our pizza dough okay now that our dough is rested now it's nice and firm so i've got some non-stick parchment paper we're just going to place it on that and on top of that another piece of parchment paper now that'll just prevent everything from sticking so with a rolling pin we're just going to roll it out to the desired shape and thickness now like other pizzas you can do this thick crust or a thin crust so just try your best to keep it in a rough circle but try and keep it uniform in its thickness throughout just so we get even cooking so once done just remove our top layer and keeping it on the parchment paper we're just going to place it onto a pizza pan and this is optional but i'm just going to just cut off the outer edges so it's in a rough circle just so it looks more like a proper round pizza base so now we have to do is just pre-bake it in the oven so we're going to place this into a preheated oven at 220 degrees celsius or 430 degrees fahrenheit for 12 [Music] minutes [Music] [Music] okay now that we've pre-baked our base as you can see it's just starting to go brown on the outside that means it's perfect you don't want to overdo it so i'm trying to keep this as keto as possible so i'm going to use my homemade keto barbecue sauce and i'll leave a link in the description to my keto playlist where you'll find my keto barbecue as well as keto tomato sauce and i'll also leave a link at the end of this video that you can tap on that'll take you to the same playlist so i'm just going to spread on our barbecue sauce but of course you can use any type of sauce that you like next we're going to add the one ingredient no pizza you could do without and that's cheese and the good thing is cheese is keto friendly there's no carbs or sugar so you use any cheese that you want be it mozzarella or tasty cheese i'm just using like a mexican blend that i picked up from costco now lastly i'm going to add some pepperoni so i'm making a pepperoni pizza now you can use any type of topping that you like you can use ham dare i say pineapple and do you like pineapple and pizza personally i do leave a comment down below and let me know if you like pineapple and pizza as well and that's it it is really that simple just to dress your pizza so we're just going to place it back in the oven so we're going to keep it at 220 degrees and we're going to cook it for about 8 minutes basically just until the cheese has just melted [Music] so and there we have a delicious coconut dough based pizza topped with pepperoni i mean how simple is that it's actually easier than making a traditional pizza base and much healthier too because you really cut out all those carbs so it's incredibly delicious incredibly simple and much healthier than a traditional pizza base and then all you have to do is just choose which topping that you want to use you can use anything that you like it's really up to you it doesn't have to be healthy it doesn't have to be no carb because a pizza base will stand on its own because it's delicious trust me you will love it and don't forget leave a comment below let me know if you like pineapple on your pizza because i'd really love to know but whether you put powder up on your pizza or not either way this coconut based pizza is going to taste simply [Music] delish you", "Jkc2ts-L9DA": "all right so we are live and recording let me just start sharing my screen here again so we are just at 1202 p.m so we will go ahead and get started my name is gina chicatel i am the associate director for susan g komen northeast ohio i would like to welcome you all to our first virtual session for our 2020 breast cancer survivor symposium uh this is our 15th year in offering the symposium as an event for our patients and survivors in our community very happy to have you on board as we navigate through covid19 and quickly adapt to this virtual conference space but very happy you all could join us today see if i can get these slides to advance here so couple housekeeping items before we get started i'd ask that you please mute your telephone lines if you can um we will have an opportunity to ask our presenter some questions at the end of the session but if you have a question that you don't want to forget about please utilize that chat box it should be at the bottom or the upper portion of your screen you can type in those questions i will be monitoring those so we can make sure that everything is addressed again we are recording this and we are live streaming on coleman northeast ohio's facebook page so if you want to share this content with anyone or if you know someone who wanted to attend but had a scheduling conflict they can absolutely get this information after the fact it will be available online for ever essentially as long as our youtube or as long as our facebook page is live um we will also post the recording to our website tomorrow so coleman e ohio i forgot the dot org there slash survivor symposium and then we'll also upload it to our youtube page so many opportunities to get the information and you can always go back and listen if something was discussed that you wanted to hear again just wanted to quickly touch on some resources that we have available on komen.org i'm going to share with you another screen if i can find it so if you go to komen.org it's sort of unfortunate that they don't have vitamin and supplement information in one centralized location but if you go to coman.org and go into the search bar and type in vitamins you can see a whole bunch of results will come up it's thinking all right yes so they have information on vitamin e vitamin a vitamin d some blog articles from some of our common funded researchers vitamin c b12 so if you were ever interested in knowing about vitamins and how they interact for breast cancer patients we have a ton of resources and information available on komen.org and for supplements when you search for those the first couple are you can ignore but once you get down you can see some evening primrose oil dandelion lycopene so supplements and herbs we definitely have information available online for those um specific things get back to the powerpoint we also have a facts for life series on all about healthy living and exercising and the benefits it provides to individuals not only individuals who are breast cancer patients but anyone overall healthy diet and nutrition are very very important it's one of our four steps to breast self awareness so of course we have lots of information available for that online as well so with that i would like to turn everything over to today's speakers we have dr aaron rush from the cleveland clinic she is associate staff breast medical oncologist with the tossing cancer center and dr yufeng lin who has a whole host of alphabet soup after her name i don't even know what half of these stand for but she works for the center for integrative medicine also through the cleveland clinic we're very happy to have them both here today i will stop sharing my screens so they can start sharing their slides and we are kicking things off with dr rush great thank you gina um so very happy to be here let me just share my screen and make sure everyone can see okay are you able to see my screen okay yes yes good to go great okay well again um thank you to uh coman and gina for the introduction very happy to be here today as gina mentioned my name is erin rush i'm a medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer at cleveland clinic and the topic of our discussion today is getting vitamins and supplements through diet and nutrition so first how can vitamins and nutrients affect cancer numerous micronutrients have been found to inhibit inhibit molecular events and signaling pathways associated with various stages of cancer development including breast cancer mechanisms include anti-inflammatory anti-proliferative antioxidant and pro-apoptotic meaning causing cell death among others data regarding effects of vitamins and supplements on cancer risk are not completely consistent in all cases so for example some studies might show benefit while others do not therefore it's always important to discuss the role of vitamins and supplements with your health care provider next how should vitamins and supplements be obtained a major factor in the effectiveness of these components lies in their natural or raw form therefore as best as possible i advise my patients and recommend that they try and obtain vitamins and nutrients they need via direct dietary sources omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are a group of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids that play important roles in cell structure fluidity and signaling the most abundant dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids are the short chain omega-3 alpha linolenic acid or ala and the omega-6 linoleic acid la most often ingested as plant oils unless they're derivatives which you can see highlighted highlighted on this figure here including epa and dha and aa are directly ingested they must be derived from ala and la respectively given the general health benefits that are increasingly being recognized for epa and dha the recommendation is to obtain 200 to 500 milligrams per day of epa and dha in the form of fish or fish oil average intakes of epa and dha combined usually from fish or supplements is a bit lower than that and the omega-3 fatty acid intakes that are recommended for healthy individuals are not likely to be effective in chronic inflammatory conditions therefore higher intake might be needed in these situations primary intake or sources i should say of epa and dha are most commonly thought of as fatty cold water fish such as salmon whereas omega-6 fatty acid aa derivative is obtained most efficiently from eggs poultry and meat so how much can one obtain from various fish sources so for example 2.4 grams of epa plus dha can be obtained from approximately a four ounce serving of salmon where one would have to eat as you can see one pound of halibut or five pounds of shrimp to obtain the same amount so as you can see the omega-3 content of individual sources may vary the influence of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer is thought to be related to the balance of inflammation in the body the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid a a in its derivatives are important in initiation and sustainment of inflammation so pro-inflammatory the omega-3 fatty acids epa and dha and their derivatives produce minimally inflammatory molecules and then inflam in inflammation resolving mediators so the net effect if dha and epa are present in sufficient amounts relative to a a the omega-6 derivative is an anti-inflammatory or inflammation resolving so how is omega-3 fatty acid intake and supplementation related to breast cancer current use of fish oil supplements in the vital trial which is a study looking at the role of omega-3 and vitamin d in various outcomes including breast cancer outcomes so current use of fish oil supplements in this study in women aged 50 or older was associated with a 30 reduction in risk of breast cancer additionally in a large cohort study of over 3 000 women with early stage breast cancer higher intake of epa and dha from dietary sources were associated with a 25 percent reduction in breast cancer recurrence and also an improvement in overall mortality another benefit of omega-3 fatty acids which i think many of us are aware of is reduced cardiac events and this can be related to how epa and dha reduce triglycerides and platelet aggregation and are thought to even have anti-arrhythmic effects furthermore studies are evaluating their role in bone density aromatase inhibitor related arthralgia we actually have a trial currently open at cleveland clinic i'm looking at this specific outcome insulin resistance weight gain and cognition vitamin d differs from other micronutrients your body actually produces vitamin um this vitamin when you expose your skin to ultra ultraviolet b radiation from the sun you can also get some of the vitamin in your diet salmon fresh tuna and mackerel are natural sources milk yogurt and some breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin d or you can take a vitamin supplement i typically recommend my patients aim for about 800 to 1000 international units of vitamin d supplement especially if they have compromised bone health are taking an aromatase inhibitor and or bone strengthening therapy such as a bisphosphonate so how is vitamin d processed in the body again vitamin d is a steroid pro hormone mainly derived from the synthesis induced by uvb radiation on dehydro cholesterol in the skin endogenous synthesis is the main source of vitamin d in the body and accounts for about 80 percent of the vitamin after synthesis in the skin or absorption from the diet vitamin d is uh transported by a specific binding protein to the liver where it's hydroxylated to 25 hydroxy vitamin d this is the inactive form and is the main metabolite circulating in the blood and is also used to determine vitamin d status so this might be what is reflective in your labs for example 25 hydroxy vitamin d is then hydroxylated to its most active metabolite in the kidneys apart from its traditional role on as a modulator of calcium metabolism and bone homeostasis vitamin d has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects vitamin d may also influence immune cell development and modulate the tumor micro environment what is the possible role of vitamin d in breast cancer a recent meta-analysis of 68 studies published in 2018 showed a protective effect of vitamin d use with a 35 reduction in risk observed in the case control studies and a 15 risk reduction in cohort studies also a meta-analysis of five studies including um nearly 4 500 women with early stage breast cancer showed that higher vitamin d levels were associated with a 40 42 reduction in the odds of death from breast cancer i alluded to the vital trial before which is the vitamin d and omega-3 study which will be investigating the role of higher dose vitamin d supplementation specifically 2000 international units with or without omega-3 supplements on a variety of outcomes including breast cancer risk sufficient levels of vitamin d are also really important for bone health as we know specifically relevant to many women with breast cancer as a result of the use of endocrine therapy aromatase inhibitors and bisphosphonate bisphosphonates which are used to not only help mitigate aromatase inhibitor bone loss but have also demonstrated breast cancer benefit in some studies so now moving on to curcumin which is a constituent of turmeric the bright yellow spice and derived from the roots of the plant curcuma longa turmeric is easily available relatively inexpensive and inexpensive and has a history of being used as a homemade remedy for various different ailments curcumin interacts with various molecules including inflammatory mediators growth factors tumor suppressors transcription factors uncle proteins and cellular nucleic acids curcumin's potential impact on carcinogenesis is complex it influences potentially breast cancer development and progression through its effect on cell cycle regulation and proliferation natural cell death cancer spread and development of new blood supply to support tumor progression there are various key signaling pathways involved here i won't go into detail on those but curcumin also mediates modulation of the tumor micro environment cancer immunity breast cancer stem cells and cancer related micro micro-rnas next piperine is an alkaline form of black pepper concomitant administration of piperine significantly enhances the absorption serum concentration and bioavailability of curcumin by about 20 fold experimental data have shown that piperine can inhibit hormone dependent and triple negative breast cancer cells cause apoptosis in triple negative breast cancer cell lines also has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of her2 which is a a subtype of breast cancer her2 over expressing breast cancer to paclitaxel which is a chemotherapy agent also have synergy with tamoxifen and again pre-clinical studies have shown enhancement of radiation effect with pipe brine in the bottom photo on the right here which was a study investigating the effect of pipeline on growth and motility of breast cancer cells the addition of piperine led to decreased viable cell numbers in breast cancer cell lines beta carotene is a precursor for vitamin a and is found predominantly in carrots mango lentils green leaves and spinach a pulled analysis of eight cohort studies including over three thousand case subjects and nearly four thousand matched control subjects showed that high serum levels of beta-carotene are associated with a 17 reduction in breast cancer risk additionally a meta-analysis of 10 studies with nearly 20 000 breast cancer cases has shown that the dietary intake of beta-carotene is significantly associated with improved breast cancer survival with a 30 reduction in the odds of dying from breast cancer in the highest versus lowest intake of beta carotene vitamin b6 is involved in many biochemical reactions and may play a role in carcinogenesis as well richest sources of vitamin b6 include fish beef liver and other organ meats potatoes and other starchy vegetables and fruits in the u.s adults obtain most of their dietary b6 from fortified cereals beef poultry starch starchy vegetables and some non-citrus fruits pure doxyl 5-phosphate is the active form of vitamin b6 a combined analysis of data derived from five studies carried out in the u.s including over 2500 breast cancer cases showed that high serum plp levels were associated with a 20 reduction in breast cancer risk compared to low levels among postmenopausal women a more comprehensive analysis in 2017 of 121 observational studies revealed that high dietary intake of vitamin b6 was significantly associated with a 22 percent lower risk of all cancers soy products or phytoestrogens contain isoflavones which are molecules that are similar to the hormone estrogen these are found in soybeans and other legumes it's this similarity which has led to some theoretical concern that soy could increase the risk of estrogen sensitive cancers including breast cancer however clinical trials have shown that soy intake does not adversely affect the risk of breast cancer these studies on humans have not confirmed a link between eating natural soy and developing breast cancer in fact there's some evidence that soy rich diets in western women prevent breast cancer and so soy is something actually that i get asked very frequently about in my clinic and i think the key here is moderation and so that's what i'll tell my patients meaning they do not have to completely avoid soy by any means but just be mindful and moderation as is recommended for many other vitamins and supplements there are various other micronutrients for which some data exists regarding potential breast cancer benefit these include egcg which is found in green tea sulfur sulforaphone sulfur affine and indole three carbinol which is found in a cruciferous vegetables and uh kirsatin which is found in several fruits vegetables and leaves despite the reported widespread use of dietary supplements during cancer therapy a few empirical data with regard to their safety or efficacy exists because of some concerns that supplements particularly antioxidants could reduce the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy a clinical trial was conducted to evaluate associations between supplement use and breast cancer outcomes in this study over 1100 patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy were queried on their use of supplements at registration and during treatment outcomes of recurrence and survival were then analyzed so in this trial investigators found that the use of any antioxidant supplement vitamins a c and e coenzyme q for example both before and during treatment was associated with an increased hazard of recurrence and to a lesser extent death and so those are the graphs that i've highlighted here for non antioxidants like vitamin b12 and iron use both before and during chemotherapy was also associated with poor disease free survival and overall survival multivitamin use was not associated with survival outcomes so conclusions from this study were that associations between survival outcomes and the use of antioxidants and other diet dietary supplements during chemotherapy and even before are really consistent with recommendations for caution among patients when considering the use of supplements other than a um other than a multivitamin during chemotherapy and so this is something that i also adhere to and recommend in my clinics again a very common question as women are being recommended for a certain treatment and are getting ready to start treatment is in terms of vitamins and supplements what should or can they take and i generally say it's best during chemotherapy to avoid the use of any additional supplements other than dietary during treatment multivitamin use in my opinion is okay so in summary key takeaway points i think include the following first really adoption of a healthy dietary pattern is really integral this includes a diet that's rich in fruits vegetables whole grains poultry and fish and then lower amounts or less red meat refined foods sweets and high fat dairy products studies have shown that maintaining a healthy body weight and regular aerobic physical activity can also have benefit on breast cancer outcomes and overall health i think again the point of moderation is really important moderation is key and it's really best to obtain vitamins and micronutrients via natural means in the diet i think it's also really important to monitor and manage any additional medical conditions such as because diagnosis such as high blood pressure high lipids and diabetes can contribute to metabolic syndrome for example and thus breast cancer risk and always really important i think and i recommend to discuss any questions that you might have with your oncologist or other healthcare provider who can help answer again any questions or concerns and help guide the use especially during during treatment for our patients with breast cancer and in the survivorship setting so again thank you um for the opportunity to discuss this really important topic with you all today and i will turn the slide screen over to dr lynn thank you dr rash so let me share my screen so do you see my screen okay yes great so i'm very happy to be with you here today at lunch hour talking about food i hope you have some healthy food around you maybe drinking a cup of tea as i was earlier um so what our goal here today is thinking about using the food that we have in our kitchen to support our overall health um i'd like to think of it as the kitchen pharmacy so um again my name is yufeng lin i am a integrated medicine specialist at center for integrative and lifestyle medicine at cleveland clinic for those of you have not heard of integrative medicine integrated medicine is a medical practice that combines the tools and understanding of allopathic medicine what we consider conventional medicine with the tools and understanding of complementary and alternative medicines such as ayurveda chinese medicine herbal medicine energy medicine and functional medicine as well as other hemo modalities with the goal to help patients heal from within so as an integrated medicine when i'm thinking about breast cancer risk commonly i'm thinking about two concepts here one is inflammation and the other one is hormone balance the risk of breast cancer really hinges on the the balance of those two issues right so today we're going to be talking about food but i want to start with just a reminder that there are a lot of things that in particular in our lifestyle that can contribute to inflammation and hormone imbalance so beyond foods we also want to consider those factors not getting enough sleep having high stress that are poorly managed loneliness not exercising being overweight smoking and drinking in excess all those are associated with increased risk of inflammation as well as breast cancer risk whereas if we make sure we get enough sleep rest well having a resilient mental health making sure we maintain a healthy weight through exercise and being active as well spending time outdoors all those also reduces inflammation that can reduce our breast cancer risk okay so i want us to to not just narrowing on the food but also really thinking about the big picture but today our focus is on food so let's talk about food and what we eat does matter in medicine as physicians are always first taught to do no harm so i like to remind people about the food that we don't want to have in our diet so the food to boy start with standard american diet they're really rich in sugar starches fry fat saturated fat trans fat and chemicals and artificial sweeteners etc standard american diet has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease with increased risk of cancer generally it happens standard record diet increases inflammation if you are familiar with the connection between gut health and overall health you understand that standard american diet also contribute to chronic inflammation through gut inflammation as well so we want to avoid standard american diet now i just want to make sure can someone just let me know you're hearing me okay because i'm not hearing any sound nope we can hear you loud and clear oh perfect okay so part of the reasons you know american diet is problematic is because it's really high in sugar and again we know that sugar contributes to chronic inflammation and in a very conventional diet oftentimes we have artificial sweeteners which are known to be associated with inflammation of the nervous system or inflammation of the liver so we want people to reduce processed foods that have artificial sweeteners as well as other chemicals in their diet and that includes soda which not only have sugar or artificial sweeteners but also can have food colorings and phosphorus which can reduce absorption of calcium and contribute to osteoporosis and we want people to avoid msg as well because monosodium glutamate is associated with inflammation of the nervous system and irritability um so in general we want to avoid processed food and we want to avoid food that has a lot of food colorings because because again that can negatively impact our gut microbiome negative impact our brain health and also contribute to adhd inflammation and irritability so now we got that out of the way let's talk about the food that we want to bring into our diet so the food to love in general we want to have food that have certain characteristics the first characteristic is that we want the food to be nutrient dense but not calorie dense we also want food that give us the ability to reduce inflammation and reduce oxidative injury we want food that are rich in fiber and we want food that can support our liver function that support a healthy hormone balance so we start with the first one food there are nutrient dense but not calorie dense essentially our food they're plant-based so the common dietary pattern that i suggest people to eat are what we considered mediterranean dietary pattern but those so this can be an asian dietary pattern as well and this is a dietary pattern really just rich in lots of whole foods lots of vegetables some fruits and also healthy fat and healthy protein now center to this diet is lots of plant-based food right so vegetables again some fruits um lots of beans nuts and seeds mushrooms because those plant-based foods have a lot of micronutrients that doctor rush mentioned earlier the vitamins the minerals are very important for our general health including our immune system they support our energy system they support our cellular regeneration the support our immune system as well as your mood and generally to support our overall healing process the thing about those vitamins and minerals is that most of them you cannot find in animal-based foods you really must get most of them through plant-based food so this is a great place to start for most individuals in terms of having a healthy diet and the second thing we want in our food is food they're rich in antioxidant that can reduce inflammation and oxidative injury and again we come back to the plant-based food again there is a study that looked at antioxidant content of more than 3 100 food and this is a summary slide from that study which is a little hard to read but since we're all sitting in front of the computer you can actually read this better than if you're sitting at the auditorium looking the slight long distance so if you look at the top you see that when you look at antioxidant content plant versus animal based food animal-based food actually has very minimal antioxidants most of the antioxidants are found in plant-based food now category compare category in in plant-based food you see that there are certain categories in plant-based diet that has more antioxidants the powerhouse that has antioxidant is berries berry have a lot of antioxidants you see that in this category so median is the median content of antioxidants in berries so you can see that berries are high chocolate and sweet so i would put the sweets aside to say chocolate fantastic antioxidant source definitely a good reason to eat chocolates nuts and seeds as well you'll see that medium nuts and seeds have some antioxidants and but the powerhouse in herbs world is the spices and herbs and we'll talk about that this study also looked at the antioxidant content in supplements and in herbal medicine you see they do have antioxidants as well but you get decent amount in our herbs and spices and nuts and seeds and in chocolate so again we can get the antioxidant through food and this is just a summary from that particular slides just to make it easier to read so we want plant uh in our diet because plant produces something called phytochemicals their chemicals are produced to support their own immune response when they're attacked by drought by bacteria by insects so the phytochemicals they produce for them are protected for the plants but as we eat those we get the benefits so the antioxidant that dr resh mentioned are are such as polyphenols carotenoids and sulforaphanes are all found in plant-based food polyphenols are the pigments in vegetables and in fruits that give all different colors from the red the greens the yellows the pearls and blues known to be antioxidants known to have anti-inflammatory properties they support liver in detoxing they are neuroprotective so they support a healthy brain they also often have antimicrobial properties so help balance out our gut microbiome also help support healthy bacteria defense for us when we're under attack for let's say by infections and also through supporting our liver function and support detox they modulate our hormones and a lot of polyphenols have phytoestrogen that dr resh mentioned as well so can help support our estrogen uh balance so ferrofam dr resh also mentioned rich increased vegetables are known to be anti-inflammatory antioxidant have neuroprotective uh function and also support liver function function and detoxing and sofia frame is really rich in cruciferous vegetables we'll come to that a little bit more and carotenoids the the phytochemical implants it gives the color of the red the orange and the yellow are known to be anti-inflammatory have anti-microbial properties and also our precursor for vitamin a very important vision so as we're thinking about plant-based food we also want to think about eating a rainbow color food because different colors of those phytochemicals are going to give you different nutrients right so you don't want to be eating the same food all the time you want diversity of different colors and we talk about herbs and spices just remember cooking with those herbs and spices also give you a power punch in terms of antioxidants and the same study that was looking at the antioxidants show that when you think about herbs and spices allspice fantastic source of antioxidants clove look at that 277 millimoles of antioxidants per 100 gram of clove that you use oregano rosemary cinnamon fantastic powerhouse so you can cook with those very easily i want to draw your attention to mint mint and other powerhouse 116 millimoles of antioxidants for 100 grams that you consume one way to get mint very easily through your diet is through teas so we can start thinking about even bringing teas as our nutrients as our pharmacy right to support your overall health so there are three t's that i really want you to consider to have in your back pocket or in your kitchen and if you have a pot if you have a plant area you can grow this during the summer chamomile lemon balm and peppermint all three of those teas or plants are easily available in supermarkets you can buy them you can grow them very easily and they all have benefit in in its ability to reduce inflammation they're powerful antioxidants and all three also are excellent at calming your nervous system chamomile is really good nerve ending again calms that anxiety um comes the nervous system and then a lot of people who may have a nervous stomach chamomiles is fantastic for that lemon balm has in addition to its anti-anti-inflammatory property it also is excellent for lifting the moods so in general when you have in winter blues you can think about using lemon balm in addition lemon balm has antiviral properties so in the winter if you feel like you're coming under the weather and maybe developing cold you can think about using lemon bun and peppermint has excellent property for not only being anti-inflammatory antioxidant but it's really good for colic in the belly so it's good for belly spasms so people with irritable bowel syndrome who may have belly cramps this is a great tea to have in your back pocket right so easily accessible available at home then let's move to mushrooms mushrooms medicinal mushrooms has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and also immunomodulating effect some of the mushrooms actually has been shown to reduce cancer risk particularly turkey tail has been shown to increase disease-free intervals and overall survival in patients with breast cancer so you want to think about cooking with medicinal mushrooms um the four listed here are the one that's most well studied turkey tail is not something you can eat as food it's it tastes papery so i if people are thinking about turkey tail usually it would come as an extract so i would put that aside from today's conversation the other three you can cook us food now rishi is not something it's easily purchased in most grocery stores but you can find this in chinese grocery store usually come as a big dry stick of mushrooms and the way to cook reishi you gotta stick it into a soup pop and let it cook and simmer for a while but it allows you to extract the medicine from vichy into the soup so that's one way of getting your medicine now my taki and shiitake those are actually nowadays very accessible you can find those usually in a health food store it's available i know in whole foods and so you can cook with those you can saute them you can stir fry you can put them in soup pots you can scramble them with eggs so there's a lot of way to cook those mushrooms and add them into your diet my taki i find works better when you buy it as fresh i thought try my taking talking doesn't really taste that good shiitake on the other hand i think the dried shiitake actually tastes much better once you tried it it gives you a different flavor profile tastes very meaty tastes very rich very earthy so you buy the dry shiitake and just rehydrate it in in boiling water let it sit for a while and to rehydrate it then you can chop it up and then put it into your food okay so this is a really good way of getting something that's healthy for you now um a word on mushroom in general the button mushrooms that we see in supermarkets don't really have the same medicinal benefits so those are not the one i usually would consider for medicinal purpose although they're excellent nutrients still so you can still cook with them and the other point i think that you want to be very mindful of is that mushrooms should be cooked for you to eat it i see a lot of people just put the fresh mushrooms into their salad mushrooms are known to have something called hepatotoxins so you want to cook those down before you eat them so in general i don't suggest people eat mushroom raw okay moving on we also want food that are high in fiber why because fiber supports a healthy bowel movement so this supports our ability to detox and eliminate toxins fiber also our big our food for our bacteria so it's to support the healthy gut microbiome and when you eat fiber it reduces absorption of sugar and cholesterol so in general a fiber rich diet improves your cholesterol and sugar profile reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease in addition when you're eating food they're high in fiber you're eating food basically they're mostly plant-based food right vegetables and fruits so you're getting a lot of antioxidant at the same time does it also reduces your cancer risk so this is just another list of food that has lots of salvo and salvia sugar again vegetables fruits nuts and seeds um beans um and even you know even baked good that has grains in it so another list for you to consider there you can get your fiber in food very easily the recommendation of fiber that you need day to day for women under 50 is 25 grams for women over 50 years old is 21 grams for men less than 50 is 38 grams and for men over 50 is 30 grams you can't get those through food and the powerhouse for fiber is beans so if you look at this list you see that baked beans for one cup has 14 grams of fiber lima beans close to 14 grams as well so if you just have a cup of beans every day you get half of your fiber needs and then if you have a couple servings of vegetables on top of that a couple servings of fruits on top of that you will need meat your daily fiber needs okay so absolutely make sure you make friends with fiber now when you think about fiber-rich food now we're talking about again fruits and vegetables we're talking about flax seeds we're talking about berries we're talking about nuts and seeds all those foods have phytoestrogens and so again dr rush mentioned that some people are afraid of phytoestrogens because they think they can trigger estrogen responsive cancers in our body study that show that phytoestrogens the estrogens are produced by plants even though they can they can attach and stimulate the estrogen receptors in our body in general they're actually much weaker than the estrogen our body produces so overall even though they might be attaching to our estrogen receptors they generate a much weaker estrogen response in our body and some studies show that they actually tend to favorably attach to the estrogen receptor that's more beneficial for cell death for bone health for cardiovascular disease benefits so in general i don't think and i agree with dr resh there's no need to be afraid of phytoestrogen but i do want to make a special note about soy because as dr rush said that soy products when you talk about real soy soy food there's really no risk associated with that i think for for um based on most studies soy food real food is okay to eat but i will be a bit a little cautious about soy products so those are two labels you can see in front of you one is from the popular protein bar and the other one is from the meatless burgers and you see in their food ingredients soy protein is the top ingredients in both of those foods so this is probably not the soy product you want to be thinking about eating right once a while i think it's okay but when we're thinking about soy based food we want to think about real soy minimally processed soy so think about tofu think about edamame think about minimally processed soy milk think about tempe those are i think okay to eat but i would suggest that people stay away from processed food or processed soy so then finally you want to bring food there really rich in nutrients that help support a healthy liver function and healthy hormone balance and the powerhouse in this category is crucifix vegetables dr raj mentioned sulfurophane and indo-3-carbonyl those are the ingredients you can find in cruciferous vegetables help support liver in detoxing they have antioxidant anti-inflammatory processes and also indul3 carbonyl helps support a healthy estrogen balance in the body thus reduced breast cancer and breast cancer risk has been shown to be reduced by 20 to 40 percent if you eat one to two servings of presurface vegetables a day so make sure you eat some surface vegetables every day in addition i want you to think about bitter food american diet is actually short on better food why is bitter food important bitter food has been shown to improve digestion it helps secrete bio acid to help digest food it promotes motility in the gut lining so this way helps you digest food better and help with elimination and also better food helps you lower sugar lower cholesterol and has benefits for our gut microbiome as well so a classic bitter food in chinese cuisine is bitter melon and some people actually buy dry bill and melon just make teeth out of it but common bitter food that you find in american grocery stores arugula right you can just eat that raw or eat that as part of your salad if you have a organic backyard you have better food in your backyard because then the lime is one of the powerhouse not only the in its leafy greens which is bitter when it's fresh then the lion can be eaten as salad but the the root of dandelion is a classic hepatic which means it helps support liver function and liver regeneration um so you definitely want to make sure you get your your organic uh your dandelion organic so if you have a yard that may have pesticide herbicides i wouldn't suggest you pick your organic pick your dandelion in your backyard but if you do um if you if you do not have excess german again you can actually find dandelion greens in your supermarkets very easily we also talk about chamomile chamomile tea it's a very refreshing tea it's very light floral but if you let it steep for a while it actually becomes bitter and it's a known bitter food that can help digest digestion and help support your gut and coffee and green teas are also considered bitter food if you let it steep for a while right a lot of people tell me when they drink a cup of coffee that i should go to have a good bowel movement so those are the things you can add in green tea in particular have the ecgc that dr resh mentioned in addition it has something called elf dna which is known to help lift your mood can support a healthy mental health the thing about coffee and green tea though is they do have caffeine so you don't want to be drinking in excess so two to three servings a day would do it okay so we talked about fruits and vegetables and i just want to briefly mention there are other things we want to consider in a healthy diet you want to bring fermented food into your diet because fermented foods supports a healthy gut microbiome so make sure you also in your diet at some sauerkraut kombucha kefir miso or kimchi any of the fermented foods in your diet on the regular basis can be very supportive for a healthy gut microbiome you also want to bring healthy fat as dr rush said omega-3 is very important reduces inflammation polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat that you find from avocado olive oil also can be very supportive so definitely bring omega-3 through your food through the food that you see here salmon sardine mackerel nuts and seeds shellfish egg etc so make them part of your diet and let's not forget about protein as well our body needs protein to regenerate and in fact in terms of liver detoxification the second phase of detox and liver requires lots of amino acid which comes from protein so if you're not getting enough protein in your diet you cannot metabolize and detoxify very well so make sure you get enough of your protein so when i talk to people about healthy diet i want them to look at their plate and then see hopefully a plate that looked like this half your plate should be full of plant-based food right vegetables a different variety of vegetables a quart of your plate should be your protein that can be plant-based or animal-based and a quarter of your plate should be complex carbohydrates again that could be grains but it can also be beans and then outside of this plate you want two to three servings of fruits and also six to eight cups of water a day right to help support a healthy body so let's move on to talk about what you have in your kitchen and started looking at playing with some of the food that you have in your kitchen so what food herbs and spices do you have in your kitchen the first herb that i have in my kitchen is actually ginger ginger has been studied for its anti-inflammatory antioxidant function it has also known to have antimicrobial antifungal antiviral function and we know that a lot of times when people have nausea so whether that's not associated with pregnancy or nausea associated with chemotherapy ginger is very good for that so half ginger in your house and garlic has been shown to have antimicrobial antiviral antifungal properties so we a lot of time think when you get sick you eat garlic right but garlic also has been studied and has benefit for cholesterol for heart protection as well so it has a lot of cardio vascular benefits and then the other food that i think we need to have in our kitchen is onions onion also have flavonoids which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties and in fact anya has been shown to reduce risk of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer there are some studies that show anya may benefit breast cancer as well but other studies not pen that out but still it's a very tasty food right so this is something that you want to have in your kitchen as a flavor flavor profile to start cooking with so when i think about my my food that i'm eating i oftentimes start with one of those three flavor agents and then add a healthy oil whether that's avocado if i'm sauteing or olive oil if i'm drizzling add a christopher's rich food or some sort of vegetables that are rich in phytochemicals and then put that over a plate off whether it's in a protein from animals or from beans right so this is a really good plate to just start to give you all the nutrients that you need that's rich not only in macronutrients but also micronutrients this is another combination you can think of i think this is more for a italian kind of meal which i love i love italian food so you can start with your garlic or onions and you can think about maybe start to think about adding spices in there so the spice that i showed here let's separate saffron not only imparts this beautiful aroma with to the dish and the beautiful golden color to the dish it's been shown to reduce cholesterol reduce sugar it's been shown to lift your mood so it's it's an excellent herb that you can cook with and again you throw in your mushrooms maybe some green leafies throwing your lycopene or croissant rich tomatoes and then put that over a plate of you know pasta whole wheat pasta or wild rice or your quinoa right and then what you want to think about is finishing your plate with something else that also add the antioxidants punch into your plate so you bring in your herbs like parsley's cilantro or regular basil you bring again black pepper that dr rush mentioned the piperine which helps absorption of nutrients it's anti-cancer like curcumin or like beta-carotene you can throw in some flax seeds which give you the omega-3 and the fiber you can add in some chili pepper fights which give you anti-inflammatory properties but also can help you fight off infection you throw in maybe a drizzle of olive oil or sesame oil for its antioxidant anti-inflammatory function and again maybe a squeeze of lemon if it's appropriate or aligned for the vitamin c for insulin support right so those are the things that i want you to think about as a way to start playing with your food now dr rush mentioned turmeric a lot of people i know take turmeric because it's been shown to have excellent profile for reducing inflammation reduce the oxidative injury and also anti-cancer turmeric also has benefit in terms of reducing cholesterol and reducing sugar absorption as well as helping having a healthier sugar balance in the body so you can cook with turmeric in curry some people can take it as a supplement but another way of getting turmeric into your body into your diet is through this recipe called golden milk tea so you just take your milk which whether whether it's regular milk or coconut milk or some other kind of milk throw in some sliced ginger throw in your turmeric powder or root turmeric and then throw some peppercorn in there let it simmer on the stovetop for about five to ten minutes strain and then you can sweeten it with honey if you want and this is a really good way of getting turmeric into your diet through food a couple more recipes to share goji berries is another one this is also known as wolf berries you can find this in whole foods and you can find this in asian grocery stores as well lots of polyphenols in there that's antioxidant rich it's also rich in vitamin b it's rich in vitamin c it's rich in minerals classically it also um in chinese medicine is used for eye health because it's zeaxanthin so i tend to take just you know a teaspoon full of goji berries and throw it into my soups or stews you can even put this into tea and in in people who maybe have gone um undergone chemotherapy sometimes you have low white blood cells and in chinese medicine astragalus is a root that's oftentimes used to support white blood cells again this is not something you'll find in most grocery store but you can find this in chinese grocery store as dried roots and you can buy astragalus throw into again your soup pots let it simmer for a while in your super stews and then you can get a soup and stew that's rich in astragalus that can support your immune system support your white blood cell function so one of my recipes that i love is this recipe called the cold buster i take fresh ginger some goji berries or rosehip that's roasted rich in vitamin c so whatever i have in the house um and throw in maybe a couple slices of dried astragalus roots and just let it simmer with water over the stove and um after five to ten minutes again strain and if i need to add some honey in it for flavor and then just drink this this is great when you just started getting sick with the colds to bring in the beginning of a culture really boost your immune system and the same recipe is excellent for pain as well because ginger is a fantastic anti-inflammatory so personal story now doctors are the worst patient i'll own up to that so one time i was um working my yard and i was pulling up pots taking moving a pot and i didn't realize that pot was rooted into the ground so when i pulled i posted to actually pull my back and it was so bad that i took anti-functioning medicines over the counter and that night i was still having so much pain i could not sleep and it was bad enough it was actually contemplating going to the emergency room to get some medicine for it so not me being me i didn't really i don't want to go to emergency room of course but you know i made myself a pot of ginger tea and after one hour i was able to go to bed right strong and temperature excellent pen reliever so something to keep in mind um and you can bring this in this is the perfect season to bring some ginger tea to help support your immune system so um as we're approaching one o'clock i want to start wrapping up with few resources that i want to share with you uh rebecca katz is a chef who's really well known for her anti-inflammatory recipes and she has a book called the cancer fighting kitchen i think this is a great resource for you to to not only first recipes in this book should really go through the benefits of ingredients of food that you want to bring into your diet she also has specific recipes that help specific side effects that you may encounter during chemotherapy over or as consequences of the treatment of breast cancer so there are two recipes in her book they're fantastic one is stir fried baby bok choy with shiitake mushrooms so powerhouse of anti-inflammatory agents cruciferous vegetables ginger garlic and shiitake another recipe is a chocolate apricot date not truffles and again who doesn't like chocolate right so you're bringing the health benefits from nuts also from fruits apricots and there's no sugar in this it's all from natural sugars on the fruit in cleveland clinic i'm blessed to work with a chef by the name of jim perkle who also work and i also work with dr mike rosen as well and they have a lot of recipes that are plant-based one of the recipes that jim uses is this raisin reduction which he used as a sugar substitution in his cooking and so he used that sugar reduction the raisin reduction to make this very oatmeal crisp which you see the recipe here but i want to share with you he's made all his recipes online in this link you see here this is he made this beautiful corner medicine toolkit in which he talked about you know what you want to have in your kitchen what you want to think about when you're cooking in terms of ingredients and again tons of recipes in there including pictures so if you just click on that link you should be able to find the the recipes that you can play with and chef purple as well as dr mike reason and dr crouppen came out with this book what to eat when cookbook which just released this month again lots of recipes in there that's plant-based this recipe tomato braised swiss chard recipe is in this book it looks beautiful very simply very easily prepared so again i want you to think about those as your resources as you move forward in your culinary journey with the kitchen pharmacy for your overall health so to wrap up if you have a kitchen recipe if you have a kitchen you have a kitchen pharmacy okay thank you for attention i'm going to stop sharing and then give it back to gina all right so i'm back on we did have one question come through in the chat box and dr rush has replied to it but i'm interested in dr lynn your take on this so it comes from linda who's with us today she is cancer-free for one year so let's celebrate that congratulations linda that is so great to hear um she is working with beth bennett at the gathering place who i'm sure you're familiar with and she was actually our keynote speaker at this event last year um she is fantastic greatly support her in all of her work she said that her advice mirrors what you've been talking about and she has switched to the mediterranean diet and has been increasing in her exercise and she feels great she doesn't even miss the artificial foods anymore right but beth had recommended that she also watch her net carb intake she is asking do you agree so the whole conversation about carbohydrates is that carbohydrates when it turns into sugar it contributes to inflammation in the body right so a lot of people are eating carbohydrates without knowing they're eating carbohydrates and and or they're getting the sugar content so one of the things that when we're talking about healthy diet i mentioned lots of vegetables and some fruits because fruits turns into sugar so sometimes when people are thinking oh let me eat a plant-based diet let me have a lot of fruit they ended up eating five to seven portions of fruits a day which can be equivalent to 100 to 120 grams of sugar or like 30 to 40 teaspoons of sugar a day without realizing it right so the idea of watching that card is just kind of thinking being very thoughtful about the food that you're eating um when you're eating foods you want to consider how much carbohydrate they're eating so i think there's some benefit i would say that's not for everybody um but it is good idea to just focus on when you're focusing on eating lots of vegetables and you're not getting a lot of carbohydrates at all in general and i think as well to add on thank you dr lynn um we didn't talk or i i didn't touch a lot on the concept of glycemic index but you know that's something as well and so certainly i think main contributors of this are these processed foods um you know but again i think that not only from the cancer benefit standpoint but from the standpoint of overall health and other conditions like blood pressure cholesterol all of those other very important other conditions that that women may have or may be managing those can all contribute to what i mentioned before the metabolic risk and that ties in with weight management and all of these things that have been shown to um be integral for um uh in the survivorship setting as well all right thank you for that um we had one other question come in from janet hey janet how you doing i know janet so happy to have you here um she's been reading information saying that tomatoes should be eliminated from one's diet what are your thoughts you can see from my face i don't agree with that tomato is a powerhouse of um antioxidant particularly if you've heard of quercetin quercetin is a strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory it also has antihistamine function so i think that there's no need to get rid of that the conversation though about tomatoes some people come are concerned about nightshade vegetables nice shades our vegetables have something called lectin and our body have lectin receptors and when it's triggered it can contribute to inflammation in the body so a lot of people get concerned about lectin a couple of things about lectin if you cook lectin you can denature which means you kind of break it down so when you eat that lectin containing food it actually does not trigger inflammation so tomatoes is one of those that you might want to think about cooking it um the same thing a lot of lectins are in nightshade vegetables so those usually you want to cook it very well before you eat it and in fact when you're talking about the antioxidant body of tomatoes it's shown that when you cook tomato you actually make those antioxidant uh property much more bioavailable your body absorbs it better than if you eat it wrong so in those in in people who are maybe sensitive to leptin so if they do feel like when they eat lectin they might feel like they're having a little bit more inflammation i would suggest you cook it well um but i don't believe you sh you should need to eliminate it and people who do have problems with lectin or with certain food oftentimes that's a reflection of their gut microbiome so if you've got micro bomb isn't healthy or if your gut lining isn't quite healthy you may be more sensitive to those and then so that might be um something to consider to honda strength you've got first maybe with fermented food um and with a healthy diet and then once your gut feels better then you can maybe bring some of those lectin rich food in or the food that you feel that's a little bit harder to digest food in but um i i think tomato is a great food to have in your diet i see dr rush nodding um and janet said thank you um we are at 108 so we are a little over time um but if anyone else has questions after the fact feel free to email them to me i can get in touch with dr rush and dr lynn and get answers for you so can always get questions answered even after this is over i did also want to point out that um dr lynn sort of rushed through the recipe section of her presentation but she was gracious enough to share her slides with us so i will pull those recipes and make sure they get posted to komen any ohio.org survivor symposium so we will you will have access to all of that as well and potentially we'll do a facebook post linking people to that directly so just want to give a big thank you to our presenters dr rush and dr lynn for helping us out providing us with this awesome information i was not hungry before this presentation but now i can't wait to get in my kitchen i got some arugula and some tomatoes sitting in my fridge so waiting to make a salad out of that oh someone's asking how they can access this recording so the facebook live stream will live on our facebook page if you just go to coleman any ohio in facebook under our video section you can access it there we will also be posting the recording on our youtube page again just go to youtube and search for common any ohio all of our videos will live there and i will also be posting it on our website once it downloads to my computer so hopefully within the next 24 hours to colemannyohio.org survivor symposium so all of multiple ways to access this recording and we will probably include the links in our upcoming november newsletter so if you've registered for this conference you'll get that information that way as well so any closing words dr rush or dr lin before we let everyone go no i think again thank you for the opportunity to present um and i agree with you i'm hungry now as well and i want to go take one of those recipes and i think it's a great time you know dr lynn and i were talking before uh the presentation today about how now it was really a great time since we are all at home with our families um to be in your kitchen and be cooking and you know from the standpoint of the an oncologist who treats breast cancer i really encourage my patients to be their own advocates and so if you have any questions or concerns always feel free to bring them to your provider and again it's our role to help guide you through you know any process that um that you're inquiring about yes and thank you for having me here it's my pleasure to share my passion about using food as nutrition with you and i hope you have fun with food have fun with food don't overthink it if it tastes good and it's real food it's all good enjoy love it i love it thank you both so much um i will close with uh everyone stay safe stay healthy stay six feet away wear a mask if you go outside and we hope to see you at one of our upcoming sessions we have one next saturday that will focus on breast cancer research and advancements that are coming through the pipeline and then we'll close out the symposium on october 31st with spooky halloween um with a presentation on managing the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation so hope you can join us for one or all of those and with that we will give you back your saturday afternoon so everyone take care thank you for joining us and i hope you stay happy and healthy today thank you for your time bye i

"[Music] [Music] welcome to yet another recipe tutorial video and today we're gonna bring back a childhood favorite protein cosmic brownies but before we begin please give the video a thumbs up please subscribe you have so much more cool content coming well because you're enjoying this we're trying to provide as much value as possible and make your lives a hell of a lot easier so let's give into the recipe alright so here's what we're going to need you're gonna need some pea science gourmet vanilla you can use whatever flavor you want a vanilla or chocolate put vanilla actually offsets the cut the cocoa powder that we're going to use it makes a litter remember that a weight casein blend will work best something like a quest or pee science works well away by itself this is not gonna work these from coconut flour some black cocoa powder so this stuff is a lot more potent and a lot more dark than regular baking cocoa so I love this stuff is potent is that super dark brownie light consistency can use regular sweetened baking soda here need some stevia one whole egg some unsweetened vanilla almond milk 100 grams of slice zucchini which I've already chopped up some baking powder and some rainbow crunch sprinkles cuz that's what goes on top of the cosmati so the very first thing I want to do is pre-heat your oven 350 degrees Fahrenheit [Music] [Music] so when we're done with this we want this to look like pulp juice but no consistency of the whole juice all right so now we have our dry browning ingredients in our bowl and we're going to mix them [Music] you don't see any zucchini in here whatsoever you don't see any chunk so now we're gonna add our brownie batter to our pan so this is a Wilton like single cavity brownie pan and get this off Amazon I'll link it below sings awesome use it for everything that just makes personal pan brownies for it eight of these slots we're going to need for our chocolate frosting that's gonna go on top of our cosmic brownies [Music] this to the fridge for about 10 to 15 20 minutes and I guarantee is going to thicken up a lot more [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] our team and that is it protein cosmic brownies in the bag

please subscribe you so much won't keep haunting coming and as always thank you so much for watching god bless we'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "hG6PUiT5dOk": "what's going on everybody gunner here uh today is all about mark sadati's yak hair slammer you check it out now time out before we get into tying this video intro is gonna be long buckle down okay because i'm gonna i'm gonna talk your ear off before we start tying this fly because it's absolutely critical that you understand a few things about this first we're gonna talk about fiber selection then we're gonna talk about waiting flies it's absolutely critical third i'll talk about what makes my version different and what the goal was behind that then i have to show you guys how to make some of your own products walk you through all the rigging teach you how to hand blend some materials then we're fine i'm going to tie this fly because the fly doesn't actually take that long to tie but it's got a ton of prep work so let's dive into fiber selection so this fly if you simple it down to its basic form it's basically a bob popovic's 3d fly at least the technique that i'm going to use to demonstrate this and understand with that 3d fly technique you could tie a three inch 3d fly or five inch or seven inch or nine inch or a 14 inch or 16 inch or however big you want to go and so what enables you to make a pattern like this versus simply an ep fly is your fiber selection and this is something i've been really kind of turned on to by captain ian devlin he talks about it a lot but basically the smaller the pattern the softer the limper the finer crinkle you want that synthetic to be if you think about ep flies you can tie a really nice looking ep fly at three five inches right as that gets longer those those materials become a little bit too soft they don't build enough bulk and they start to follow right so you move up into a slinky blend a slinky based blank slinky's a synthetic product quite a bit stiffer a little bit more weight to it builds bulk a little bit better the stiffness allows it not to follow as much you can get away with a six seven eight nine inch pattern when you step up into the big realm you're truly i'm trying to imitate adult herring cisco's whitefish menhaden bunker right big profiled forge that trophy fish eat like musky striped bass whatever you're going for trophy lake trout right you move into yak hair and yak hair has an unbelievable stiffness and crinkle and length that make it truly exceptional for tying big flies now yak hair kind of hard to get it was discontinued this year for trying to sourcing options basically limitations on being able to source it and diet and all that stuff you can find really crazy premium yak from ellis ward who runs flyzottix and then you can also pick it up from captain ian devlin who i mentioned earlier he has a page called devlin blends and he blends the yak for you which is going to save you quite a lot of time so those two guys ellis ward ian devlin are going to hook you up all this is in the description so that you don't have to remember all this also a link to sadati's original video i highly recommend watching it this video will be very different from that and that's why you should watch both because it'll give you some perspective so we got that out of the way i forgot the order that i told you we were going to do all this right waiting flies into waiting flies so the thing that makes sadati's fly truly unique more unique than anything i've ever kind of watched is the fact that these things are weighted and i don't mean like he put some lead eyes on it or you know he filled the shank with lead or something like that this thing has roughly about three grams of raw lead wire weight three grams it's heavy it's got i think i use about 22 inches when i do mine and i want to talk about something real quick because this fly is long that yak hair is very crinkly this fly is three dimensions it's not just a low profile little bucktail deceiver bullet like look at this thing it's almost four inches across and it's at least an inch wide and i could make it quite a bit wider if i stacked it that way right and it's 14 freaking inches long and so what you have to understand about flies what makes a fly hard to cast people always say heavy flies are hard to cast but they that's nuanced anyway what is actually hard to cast is air resistant flies air resistant flies why because you go to cast and that thing just slows everything down and so what happens is to compensate you throw a bigger rod with a heavier line and what you're doing is you're increasing the mass of the fly line increasing the momentum of the fly line so that the fly line can hopefully over compensate for that de-acceleration caused by fly now uh what mark discovered in his tying way back when in life talking like 1990s here was that you could build a fly so that it had its own momentum think about it but give the fly momentum and and what is so cool about this is you reach a point with a fly that it basically no longer is interacting with that fly line and and de-accelerating it but it flies with it the the fly line relative to its its mass and its velocity and its air resistance and the fly relative to its mass and its air resistance they basically just fly together and you might think i'm absolutely crazy but this point of of weight relative to air resistance is called weight balance and it's the point of kind of maximum efficiency where the two can go the entire length of that cast flying together not de-accelerating that fly line but flying with it because you've weighted it you've supplied the fly with its own momentum with mass and it makes for the craziest cool casting flies ever now that could sell like sound like a sales pitch but i tried it i watched mark sadati's video like five years ago maybe four years ago and i was like bs i'm not putting all that weight on there and i casted it weightless and it sucked i then began to randomly weight it vaguely without a reference point or any way to weigh anything which is something i'm going to talk about real quick here and it sucked to cast i tried two fly versions i tried conehead version i tried all this stuff i finally sat down earlier this year about mid-summer and i tied it the way mark does in the video with all that weight and i'll just i'll show you my reaction just watch this mark's a dotty slammer about 13 inches or so all yeah care weighted key weighted the way he does it so let's see how castable she is right what that's disgusting that's ridiculous i was dang near speechless i literally just went like it just went because it didn't have the wind resistance it had its own momentum it just went with my fly line and it just traveled together i could sit there and i could pop out a 90-foot cast cast after cast after cast this is like three hours into fishing mind you and it's like my head exploded it was crazy and so what you have to understand that becomes very critical to this is that that weight the raw material weight of that fly it's relative to your hook right because here this is the the tp 610 and the six out this is what i'm going to tie it on it's kind of perfect for this for my freshwater predators that hook weighs 1.4 grams 1.4 if you were to go into a saltwater fishery this is an adot blue water hook from a rex 3.38 3.4 right this is 2 grams heavier do you know how much lead wire is in 2 grams check this out this is what i'm going to use uh to fill up my hook shank it's 14 inches of o3 0 lead wire it weighs 1.94 this tp610 is 14 inches of 030 lighter than this adod so your hook selections make a world of difference your hook selection your stinger hook your any sort of component tree could even be like crimps clasp beads lead eyes whatever understand it all makes a difference and so when you start changing the hook changing the stinger hook adding a rattle these all make a difference what i highly recommend you do is pick up a gram scale so that when you tie this fly hopefully the way i dem i demo it or the way sadati demos it and you cast it and you poop your pants a little bit you can then weigh all that so how much lead did i use how heavy was my hook and you have now a reference point for a weight balanced sadati slammer that you can then deviate from intentionally not vaguely so as we go through this i'm gonna more or less i'll describe the inches of everything that i apply i'll also tell you the raw weight so that you have that for reference for my version of this fly which brings me into the final point what makes my version different of course i kind of treat the material just a little bit different tying technique-wise and i put a different head on it so that it's really nice and clean and low friction none of that is truly that different but what i do differently is i have been trying for about a year and a half now to get these to suspend because it's a lot of weight and the problem with that weight is that they dip head first and it's not that they dip fast and understand that the original application for this fly in a saltwater fishery is to fish it fast the whole point is to fish a flask you might even have a floating line so you need that weight to get it a foot or two under and then really get that thing moving with a fast single hand two hand retrieve under the armpit type stuff right you want that thing moving quick or in a big rip tide or a big jetty something it's it's that constant animation retrieve all that weight does not matter but i am applying this in a still water esox fishing and i want hang time boom absolutely get wrecked by a 40 plus inch muskie right so what i've done is i've developed a kind of a little foam technique we're going to use a 5 8 inch 5 8 of an inch diameter foam plug that i'm going to shape into three material dams that we are going to use to dam up the fibers and balance out the weight and raw weight of the hook and all the lead wire it's not perfect but it is as close as i can get to suspending nearly level with just a little bit of head dip and when you fish it it's actually pretty darn good testing it in the bathtub it's like ninety percent what i want not quite 100 it's about 90 but in a fishing situation it's about as good as i have gotten which is why i'm ready to share this pattern with you guys so that is enough jibber jabber i got to show you guys real quick how to blend up some yak i'm going to show you guys real quick how to shape and sculpt that foam to make three material dams that will fit on a 6 out tp610 then i have to show you guys all the rigging the lead wire the stinger hook rig the size of my stinger hook all that nonsense then we will finally tie slammer so this one's going to be a long one hope you guys try this because it'll change the way you tie big flies literally forever let's do it so first off it's a little bit premature but first thing we got to do is rigging so what i want to talk to you about i'm using a 6 out tp610 nice long shank going to give us room to to get all of our material plugs on there our foam material dams it's going to give us a nice long shank to actually weight the fly with lead wire has a really nice long gap which we are going to weight this hook gap sadata does not do that sadati builds something called a keel box kind of in this rear section of hook i'm basically going to take all the lead from the keel box and put it literally on my drop down bend so that the weight has a ton of leverage but it also keeps this area round which makes it simple to put my foam and slide my foam onto it also helps keep the weight towards the back of the hook and not so much up towards the front so the weight of that six on tp610 1.4 grams all of this by the way will be recorded in the description again stinger hook four oc gamakatsu you can come with a three after two out but the floor is a really nice size and we're going to connect that with a stiff wire the weight of that hook helping to pull down the rear of that fly and i will run that hook down doesn't quite seem intuitive typically you want your hook points in different planes to maximize hookups but the way i tend to trim these flies is they have less material on the belly and this hook stinger hook is not properly rigged right here i had an accident with this one but i have less material on the bellies the fibers are shorter so i have less materials impeding that hook gap and that makes for a stickier hook point so that's why i run that hook down that's going to run you 0.8 grams i'm going to fill up my hook shank with about 14 inches of lead at 0.30 inch diameter that is approximately 2 grams it's 1.93 and then i'm going to take eight inches of lead and that is going to be my drop down keel on my bend those eight inches are one gram 1.03 so that's everything you need to do i'm gonna tie this whole fly with point two millimeter that's eight thousandths of an inch vivis monofilament tying thread and zappagap and ca plus and the zappagap and that monofilament thread will help plastic weld all this for maximum durability so i'm going to load up that shank with some serious thread here i'm going to come in now with i put the packaging away my articulation not articulation but my stinger hook wire i'm going to come in with a nickel titanium this is 65 pound understand that for esox fishing this rear hook is basically going to be your primary hook especially on those kind of mid-body eats so go big go 65 go 70 go 80 however big you can get some wire and i like that not too kinky because it does not kink it's got a little bit of stretch to it so it helps absorb some of that shock as long as you don't basically damage or over crink kink the wire here when you seat this it'll last a good long proper time let me give me a sec just want that seated nice and again i'm going to run that hook down now i'm going to use that's going to be back quite a ways like four inches at least and i'm going to thread that through my hook guy here and i'm going to let that wire come back basically as long as i can the full length of the hook to increase the diameter of that hook shank so that my lead wire fills it up really quite nicely it's going to be slightly irritating to deal with but it is what it is now this works very well for me uh going through the hook eye obviously so they can't get pulled out but understand that my leader build when i fish for esox allows me to do this because i i typically run single strand steel just single strand steel which is very low profile that i not to each individual fly so if this fills up your hook eye too much and you're someone who uses snaps you might want to look for a different solution here but this doubled back through gives me plenty of room in that hook eye for tieable wire notable wire 40 pound real bite wire anything like that and i use my single strand so there's plenty of room if you do it nice and clean but you're not going to get you know like a full-sized snap in there if you're someone who uses snaps for your esox leaders i'm going to cut that right there at the bend and the back flush with my tying thread again to increase the diameter and the volume of this shank so i'm just going to double half hitch got my 4 out trailer on there i'm going to come in with my ca plus and i'm going to load that up now as that is still tacky and dry and really make sure that that back bend is secured i'm going to come in with that 14 inches of o3-0 lead wire and before we get too crazy i'm going to put a piece of foam on this that thing's a nightmare right there to deal with anyway 14 inches this is the long one i'm going to start that right here in the back and just hand over hand that nice and tight all the way up and again i'm trying to keep the weight towards the rear because personally i want the nose of this hook to suspend as level as possible even if it sinks i want it to try to suspend level so those are my 14 inches of o30 now this gets a little bit tricky up in here but i'm going to come in with my eight inches of 030 so that's 22 inches total by the way come in and just grab this with some hackle pliers real quick and i'm going to get that right up tight inside of there so that it all fits and i need to get a few turns on there so that i have some friction on it tell you right now this is the craziest most rig heavy fly i tie and yet it is so worth every moment of this the moment you tie this thing on and see it in the water so again this is keeping the weight in the rear and as you move down that gap you increase the leverage with every increasing turn i'm going to double it over right here at the bottom which is going to be the point of most leverage it's going to have the most leverage that far down and it's also going to be the thickest heaviest part now this looks absolutely bonkers and yet it is just barely heavier than this adot just barely so understand how important your hook selection is relative to your environment that this fly is going to be fished and then with a gram scale you can compensate accordingly now we've got a lot of other work to do so i'm just going to come i'm going to hit all that stuff with just a light thing of super glue this is something that you can cover with uv resin or epoxy to really lock it in place you can also come in with thread wraps and wrap over all that to lock it in place i'm just going to take the simple route right now because we're filming the next step foam plugs so these foam plugs if you take a full plug and just lightly tie it on here it's enough to support all that weight and actually be buoyant but the way i trim them down to make kind of a nice soft angle for my material dam very similar to this shape right here they obviously lose some of that buoyancy the point where the weight of the materials kind of the weight to the silicone at the head everything just makes it sink a little bit so that's basically the shape you will be looking for nice soft rounded edge 5 8 of an inch diameter thick nice concave back so that you can seat everything over top of itself and i'm basically going to take a full plug and this by the way is probably the fastest way to get arthritis in your thumb joint i'm just going to sit here and make an absolute mess of things don't cut your fingers and i'm going to trim this once you get that nice rounded soft edge come in with a razor blade cut that flush on the back side and then you just shove your scissors into it and clip out a little cavity in the back it doesn't have to be perfect or super deep or anything it just has to be more or less symmetrical it's the only thing you're looking for now i'll show you how to do the full first one and then i'll do the other two nice and quick for you then you're just gonna heat up a bodkin you're going to take that hot point push it straight through that foam body and that's just going to make a nice little path for your scissors to follow open your scissors up put them through that hole and then just ream that sucker out so that it can fit over that hook eye and over all that lead and then over a little material tie-in section and really make a nice material damn it's supposed basically like flyman's body tubing but a buoyant version that's basically what we're going for and you need three of them so back to work i now have foam all over the place but i have three 5 16 of an inch little basically foam material dams that's basically the full thing i cut it into thirds this one's a little bit big but i'm going to save that one for the end and try to really get some buoyancy at the head so basically you take that full cylinder which i think they're an inch and a half long is that right i don't know but i take that full cylinder and split it into thirds so now back to the yak you have a few options here this is from ellis ward this is the flyzotic yak check that's a fly right there that's like 20 inch 20 inch long fiber your other option let me get some here you have the hairline uv2 spirit riverjack here this is now discontinued if you find this at a fly shop and you want to try it buy it now because they're going to be sold out soon and you have nowhere else to get it other than that you have my friend captain ian devlin who pre-blends it with flash for you it's going to be crazy useful because this is a time consuming pattern it'll basically cut the time down in half i can stack this thing fairly quickly the blending and the rigging is actually the most time consuming part pre-blended with flash now i'm going to make my own blends here just so i can show you how to do it but there you go that's how you find your yak i'm going to start my thread so that when we get on here we're ready to go for all you do to self blend like what i'm going to show you how to do the product that you want is predator flashabou because this stuff is 20 bloody 20 20 bloody inches long it's freaking long so if i have 20 in jack here and i have 20-ish flash blue flash of blue i gotta learn how to talk apparently uh but i can blend the two so that's what you want another thing to consider the matte colors like gold and silver or purple or copper they're solid they're very very limp and they won't impede the action of the eck that's also why we're not using magnum flash but i'm using predator flash thinner thinner thinner if you come in with the holographics they have that nice holographic effect to them but they're also going to be a little bit stiffer and a little bit thicker so you can play with that however you like but time to get some yak hair blend it up but my tail is going to be this really cool light olive from alice i'm going to use a pretty good chunk because it's going to be my tail stack and i'm going to need a top and bottom which is going to be about yay big that tail stack is going to be your thickest stack the tail stack is basically the fly and then your top stacks and your belly stacks are your silhouette so get a pretty good amount of that first blend base and i'm going to leave that about 13 inches or so because i like a big fly then i'm going to come in and sculpt a white belly i'm going to need two white belly stacks that are going to be pretty thin and then one on the sides so a little bit lighter than what i just did with the light olive here same length and then i'm going to come in with this really sick sucker color that he has i don't know what it's called but i'm going to need two stacks for the back it's going to be about yay thick and that one i'll leave a little bit longer just so i can get some tone in the rear so something you can see these blends are getting uh pretty darn complex i tend to use because i have a lot of colors of flashabou i use a lot of colors of flash but so right now i have gold i got silver i got opal i got holographic yellow holographic gold holographic copper basically i just run through it and pick whatever is going to complement that pretty pretty nicely now i'm going to take these stacks and just kind of get them out of the way here and i'm going to sit here and i'm going to hand blend all of them before we get started so that we can just run through the fly now if you're going to do this in bulk you can look up a video by steve farrar on how to blend flash i'll link it in the description but you basically lay it all out on the table fill it with flash roll it all up tease it all out fill it with flesh roll it all up tease it all out roll it back up what i like to do is just grab it at the bottom tease it out and then restack it so i call this rip stacking and it's what i do when i blend per fly so i'm just making one set of colors for this one fly that i'm tying right here right now within there won't be any left over and i tend to tie like that a lot because i like to do each one a little different and unique in in the moment and that's why i take the long way sometimes it's more i don't know it helps the creative process i suppose so i'm going to take my light olive blend here and i'm going to get it so that 60 of the fibers are going to be on top of the hook 40 on the bottom of the hook so your relative density this is basically your fly the rest of this is silhouette and i kind of like this end for my tail i like it when the flash boost sticks out of the yak just a little bit so i'm going to basically get the full length of my fly right here and i'll tie that in about as long as i possibly can which would be about 13 maybe 14 inches this is just a simple high tie so i'm going to lock that right on top with my thread i'm going to walk that back and make a fat little base right there and the one thing that i do different than sadati is i tie in every single material twice and lock it like that with a nice bullet tie he tends to just tie it in and cut it off but i tie everything in twice so that it ain't going anywhere no matter what happens with an e-socks now my bottom stack i'm not going to tie it in as long as i can i'm basically going to hold it up and get some taper to it so it's going to be a little bit shorter on your overall length when you come up and catch this keep it right on the the bottom there you can see all my fibers are on this side of the hook but my material is dead center so don't worry about that let's just make sure it's in the right spot fold that back nice and hard get a clean bullet catch again it's all on my side of the hook now i can hold these both up have that hook point split them 50 50 so they're in the right spot put down solid thread come up lock in a half hitch lock in a whip finish find your scissors ignore how insane this looks and then free those up anyway so i'm going to lock that in and hit all of that mono with some ca plus make sure i have a good little foundation there work over my first popper body and just kind of reef it on there and pack it back as hard as i can so that it doesn't eat up too much of my room here and that's your first material dam come back in front of that and so you can see we're going to get some added volume here but you don't really need these material dams to give the fly volume because the yak hair has so much crinkle to it i'm going to split my back color in half the thicker one's going to go on first i'm going to run that just shy of my tail dressing now you can stack this in whatever shape bait fish you have if you have you know more of a sucker-ish you could all suckers are still pretty fusy for them but you can make it you know width-wise more of a sucker pattern i'm going to tend to hide high tie low tie this entire fly with only one stack really for the sides and then i'll just come and manipulate that before i super glue and tie everything off but so it just has a slight little veil to it for width come to the bottom side this one is basically going to run pretty close to 50 50. so i'm going to fold these fibers more or less right in half again it's all just on my side of the hook reef that back and then now you can kind of pull them up get them even split that hook point give a little bit of fanning to them and then lock in that material come in again half hitch caught some flash blue in there fixed my whip finish that was chaos try that again and then you're just going to comb it out i told you the flag goes pretty quick once you're actually ready to tie it basically it's just stacking come in and super glue all that again come back in with another foam dam now i got my last wing here this one's finally going to get to be about 50 50. build some height to the fly there and we got a lot of stuff to tie in right here so i'm going to make a pretty big material or a thread bump here so that we can get it all in fan that out just a little bit fold that back and you'll see i'll just have a really nice kind of big thick thread bump right here so that we can get it all on i'm kind of trying to tie quick because i know this video is going to be forever long now when i come in with this last section of white i'm basically going to split that in half i'm going to come cut this thick section in half re-taper that this is going to be my belly stack and get some long taper to it that's okay so we'll tie that in long short so like 60 40ish really get that on there and now that we're not so close to the hook point it can just go right dead center over the hook point catch that so we're going to build a really big ugly thread bump here with a really nice tall steep belly to it and we're going to be able to control that belly because we have all that lead on that bend that's not going to be a problem whatsoever now i'm going to build out three dimensions here so i tend to cut this last stack like so just a little bit of taper so i'm going to get some length that's going to veil and cover all that it's also going to give you some shoulders and three-dimensional attributes right here at the head my steering hook is just getting wrenched man so let me come in here i love it i don't think i've ever tried to tie this thing so fast it's been eight minutes and 40 seconds hit all that with some good glue take the biggest popper you got reef it on there let me show you guys what we have here so that you don't think i'm out of my mind here i'm pretty sure if you've never seen one of my videos before right now you're just about ready to write me off as a crazy person so you can see we stacked three dimensional shoulders into it it's not super narrow with those two little white stacks and veiling the back we have a ridiculous amount of height it's easily four inches across and then we have all that length with the primary fly being that kind of pale lime green that's untrimmed coming straight back down out of the center like that's sick it came out pretty darn good and i have a perfect hook my stinger hook i'm going to admit is a little bit long i wish it was kind of like right up in here it's about an inch farther back than i'd like now what i'm going to do before we finish this guy off i'm going to trim up that tail a little bit i'm going to come under here and sculpt that belly up that just got streamlined pretty darn good right there check that out that yak will hold that steep belly shape really nice in the water and i have all that length silhouette counter shading tone and flash blends going all the way back sick that's locked in this monstrosity is locked in i'm going to come in now something you can do over every single one of these foam pieces that i neglected to do one because i've forgotten two because it takes a little bit of time but these all have flashabou body tubing flared over top of that foam and it makes for a really cool flash core and i'm going to show you how to do it right here because it also makes for a really cool gill pack behind the head so you come in with you know an inch and a half section of flashabou minnow body tubing it's just a mylar cord over rope yeah obviously you take the rope out of the center that's just a spacer so that can actually wrap the mylar on it flare it with your finger push that right over that hook point and then lock that in and so the previous two i've done that over every single one so you get three of those bad boys at the core of that fly and it makes for some really cool contrast really tight to that hook shank of course it's right at the head and the gills and your fins and everything it's a really cool accent to throw in there not you know critical but fun and actually pretty easy i wish i would have done it for the whole thing anyway the head is simple strong fuzz with a silicone top coat the silicone is not crucial but if you do it correctly it will trap an additional pocket of air against the head and this piece of foam additionally it does add a little bit of weight the primary goal with it is it reduces a lot of the head friction just so the fly's a little bit more slippery in the water because this has a lot of friction and with all that weight a slippery head will get a much better profile turn because it doesn't stop as fast so i got to get some strong fuzz we're going to do dark brown over white blend it with some wing and flash some custard colors i'm wearing a flash for complexity and i'll show you how to stack that ah i'm going to do dark brown over cream i've been using the cream a lot lately so it's right on top keep it easy because we went with a very copper-ish tone i'm going to use medium brown this is a nice coppery color that's going to blend with this brown really really well and then for the belly i'll just do a nice pearly opal cheek coming in with the pearl so for your strong fuzz i do all my heads more or less the same if you've seen my videos in this size category i'm going to cut it off that hank rip it down at its full length tease it out a little bit there i'm going to cut that in half and cut it in half again so it's going to be at one quarter of the length of the hank that's going to be my rear stack that's my front stack i'm going to blend them together to save time and i'm going to do the same with the bottom so those are your proportions all right so i'm going to come in with my strong fuzz i'm going to leave it nice and long over the back to help bridge the gap from that foam i'm going to stack it basically just right on top two or three turns to control it get to the underside in with my throat patch here it's going to be a nice fluorescent this one fluoresces quite a bit creamy throat patch again just two or three turns right tight to that foam as i bring my thread forward and up here see i'll just pull back the brown first come up get the cream locked in place just get my thread on and then i can pinch that stuff to the sides if it wasn't tied in perfectly just manipulate it now after the fact get right tight to that strong fuzz and half hitch very lightly comb that out and what you're going to do is you're going to set this back with some zapper gap so you just coat the fibers right at the base there and all you're doing is setting the angle of the base you don't need to use a ridiculous amount you're not trying to like glue the head you're just trying to set that hollow angle so you don't have to use thread to do it so you don't crowd your hook eye it's all about keeping everything clean right there at the hook eye so you can actually get this guy tied off another stack closer to 50 50 for a little bit of bulk you know what because this is probably going to happen to you guys you need to understand this happens to me obviously crowding your hook eye is not a fun thing to do where's my there's my strong fuzz i got a thread turn that fell off there i'm going to save most of that not a big deal roll up here it's the first time i've ever broken my thread there again those are some pretty unique circumstances though comb that out it's a good thing we super glued that you can see i'm not dealing with a lot of room here but i'm dealing with a lot of material restarted my thread wrap that back i'm going to pinch this in the same spot that i pinched it before i'm going to pinch that way back there i'm going to focus simply on catching it and i'll distribute it later kind of move it around manually after everything's tied in i can use my finger to help really seat that farther back ah look at that hook eye it's not that much better but it's better remember when i said that last one was the thickest and the longest i was trying to save the buoyancy for that i think it might have bit me in the butt there could have used with just a hair more room right there at the hook eye [Applause] so i'm just taking my ca plus soaking it right into my thread wraps with just a little bit of extra and then taking my fingers while i pull that back and i have a fully cleaned hook eye despite all of that chaos all right we're running on the batteries here time for some quick comb it out peel it back don't screw it up now you won't forgive yourself for that one of course you could always just cut the head off and redo it but i'm going to just shape that so that it bleeds into that yak hair as best i can try to get it nice and clean on the sides because we are going to glue some eyes on here the eyes are going to be 3 8 of an inch you can see i got them on my thumb there 3 8 of an inch sticker eyes and again the goal with this fly is to keep the weight of the head as light as possible a sticker eye weighs way less than a dome eye because that epoxy dome adds quite a bit of weight to that fly so come in with a sticker eye if you can the biggest one you can find i'll show you guys what we have here before i put those eyes on how sweet is that come back in lightly lock that in place make that nice and flat on the sides symmetrical on the head it's very three-dimensional i'm going to come in with liquid fusion i'm going to come in with a pretty big drop about the size of the pupil of my eye i'm going to put the eye back a ways which is all right because this is a two-step head step one is get the eyes in place let them set up it takes a while because that's a lot of glue might take an hour or two but come in with your sticker eye put it right on top of that big dab of glue that's set back from the head so that it's in a realistic position for this size fly and we're going to let that glue set up could come back in an hour might come back in two hours might come back and whenever i come back and i want that there's the stinger hook and i'm going to let that glue set up 100 and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to come in with some silicone and clear and do a thin single layer top coat over all of that strong fuzzy fiber and trap and seal in that head and put a layer of silicone over those eyes to maximize and increase their durability all right a few hours later that glute is set up nice and firm the reason why i like to glue the eyes to the fibers is because i can do one single thin layer of silicone because the silicone is quite heavy if you put a lot of silicone on here and then apply eyes and then try to put silicone over the ice to seal them in place it ends up being quite a bit of head weight that i don't want i just want one smooth layer trap some air between this head and that first foam coat the eyes slick it up remove all the friction i will say i'm pretty darn happy with how this came out for how fast i tried to dye it i just wish that stinger hook was like an inch and a half shorter if it was right here that would be about perfect so i didn't tell you the length of that stinger hook so shouldn't bother you but when you guys do this on your own don't imitate that portion of the video so i got that locked in i'm going to come in here this is ge2 you can use ge2 ge2 plus basically the difference is this one has a little bit less ammonia smell to it but they're all any of the g silicones are fantastic for this you want it in clear they do offer different colors so be wary of that you don't need a wetting agent really because we're just going to do one layer and really just smash it into the head let me see if that's 100 true because sometimes you get in the moment and you got to react on the fly i'm just going to take some silicone here and just put it on your finger just like that and i'm just going to wipe that over that head material or that strong fuzzy fiber and of course you're going to get it all over your your hook eye which you'll clean out at the end you can keep it a little bit thicker over the eyes if you need to walk your bike vise backwards because your stinger rig is getting in the way there this is something you could apply in your hand if you don't have a rotary vise it's not really a big deal because it's super viscous it doesn't it's not like running all over the place or drippy or gooey or anything like that all right now i'm going to focus up a little bit you see i just kind of rub it off my finger i just use the fibers to wipe it basically off of my finger impregnating those making sure that it's really sealed up right at the hook eye and this will if you put it especially over kind of a dark fiber it'll kind of have kind of a muddy look to it when you're done but for the advantages of it i think it's well worth it even if it doesn't look perfectly true to tone and something i have in my desk right now that you've seen me reach for is a rack you should do this with a rag paper towel anything of the sort like that basically that's that now just come in with your bodkin make sure that hook eye is nice and clear also i got a well i got a row of vices behind me and usually i'll drape it in one of those but for right here right now let's just put that guy right there now that silicone it needs about 24 hours to properly set up it'll be kind of firm and rock solid and you can do stuff with it in three but you don't want it to see water for 24 hours so that's why you know the whole fly start to finish is quite a build from shaping the foam blending the custom yak actually doing the rigging and getting everything set up then tying the fly then letting the eye set up then coming in with your silicone and then letting your silicone set up but it is the slickest best casting large profile fly i've ever fished in my life and the thing that's really cool about that and what i noticed flies that cast easily they keep you in the game not that well they just they keep you focused you don't you don't get frustrated you don't get flustered uh when you can poke out 80 90 foot casts back to back to back to back you're it's exciting to fish especially in still water i know 90 feet sounds like a big number and you always hear the argument that you don't need to cast far to catch fish but i'm telling you the moment you step onto a lake if you can only cast 30 feet it feels like you're fishing at your feet like a river is different because you can read the water and you can stock the fish and set up on the spot perfectly and get one nice clean short 15 foot cast in there and pop a monster but when you're still water fishing when the name of the game is covering water when you're fishing for low percentage fish like musky and you're counting down your 10 000 casts and paying your dues you need to have a fly that you can cast joyfully because otherwise it feels like you're just hitting your head against the wall because it's absolutely miserable to try to catch low percentage fish with flies that do not effectively or efficiently cover water so this is kind of my go-to thing that i'm super excited about for 2021 because i finally got it all dialed in the way i want i know that's quite a build what i'm going to do here at the end is i'm going to put this guy in the swim tank i'm not going to run the tank because the fly's too big you won't be able to see anything but i just want you to see uh how nearly balanced it is it's not perfect it does drop it does drop slightly head first but that 5 8 of an inch foam triple plug body material dam is pretty sick so get this 13 inch mark sadati suspending slammer in the tank and as always thanks for watching and of course as soon as it gets in there all these all these fibers they need to kind of get in the water and absorb some of the water so this takes a while here whenever you get to your fishing spot you always want to get your flies wet before you fish them that way they're fishing on the first real cast when you put them in front of a fish you just kind of get this thing wet you'll see once it's fishing that ain't bad you see what i'm saying that's sick look at that that ain't perfect but it is pretty darn close that right there is a mark sadati suspending slammer so you can see i kind of tie it like a flash blue fly almost i blend quite a lot of flash into that yak here because the yak gives the flash structure so you can create like a three-dimensional flashabou fly more or less i wish my tank was about 10 times this size and i could actually strip a fly but thanks for watching guys hope you dig it hope you stayed to the end hope you tie one up because it will blow your mind yes look at that thing all right see ya", "eJad_tiltuY": "[Music] what's up youtube so today we are going to be installing something pretty exciting we are going to be installing a completely brand new coilover system for those who don't know i've been racing around here with my mrs with blown megan easy streets that i got used off a parts car i've never owned new coilovers in my life on all my cars i've always bought used because coilover systems can be pricey and i decided that i didn't want to put my money towards that when building this car i put all that money towards a cusco 1.5 way lsd which was a better choice to begin with but now that i've learned how to drive this car pretty decently i i always had room for improvement as far as a better coil over suspension setup system so um the timing was right and um on instagram s3 suspension reached out to me they're relatively new coilover company that does custom suspension with custom valving custom spring rate at your request they reached out to me offered me their new suspension system for the mrs and i decided to go with it i don't have any experience with s3 and i have never tried them before so i will be giving my honest impression after they're on the car looking at their instagram though they do have some pretty fast cars that they also sponsor but um they are mainly on the honda platform but um the owner of s3 suspension recently picked up an mrs as well and he wanted me to try these out and give my review and of course tell you guys about it um if i do like them so let's take a look so um well here's the box first off it was really nicely packaged sorry i didn't do like an unboxing video but i already took out one rear and one front coil over so that i could show you guys before i install it on the car so let's check out the initial impression and build quality here's a rear here's a front this is 12k spring and 7k spring i guess first off notably is they use swift springs for the custom spring rate if anyone knows anything about suspension swift springs are one of the best in the business as far as the actual spring coil themselves so i'm looking here at the bottom i can tell that this is where you adjust the camber this is similar to my mcgann's and other mcpherson strut type suspension because you can't really adjust camber on mcpherson cars without after market components and this is one way to do it this is the one that's similar to what's on my car now and i haven't had the car lose its alignment driving as hard as i do for over a year now as long as you torque it down there really isn't an issue that i've seen the car pulls currently at least on the gopro i've hit 1.5 g sustained and the strut hasn't shifted so moving up here we can see the first time i've ever had a clean coilover perch so this should make adjustment easy here we have the height adjustment through the coilover bottom perch tube where you can spin it up and down to adjust the height preload is here it was pre-adjusted before they shipped it to me i asked so preload is set all you have to do is set your height and rake the height is even side to side brake is up to you so we have 12k spring here nice dust boot here the top hats um you can see it's a spherical which is nice so car should be more responsive nice studs here nice finish doesn't look like there's any rust here's where the adjustment screw goes so it's some assembly required here the adjustment knobs i'll probably throw that on afterwards um yeah all looks good uh we'll find out how they drive so let's move on oops my glasses let's move on to this front coil over here um again we have camber adjustment here at the bottom um both of these have the um what is that the brake line perch and sway bar end link perch so that's good um here's the front again so here we have the height adjustment bottom spring perch and preload adjustment dust boot and then we have the pillow ball top again and we have these really nice camber plates i don't have camber plates currently on my meganes so this should give me some nice adjustability here again adjustment is on the top nice studs here and nice lines here for adjustment so overall i mean it looks like oops looks like pretty good initial impression as far as visual inspection for a coilover one-way adjustable damper one-way meaning rebound adjustment damping so let's throw these on i'm excited to throw them on and try it out i might check in with you guys periodically throughout the install but i'm not going to do a tutorial because it's pretty straightforward there are other tutorials on youtube i'll just point out some stuff along the way and yeah we'll check the fit and finish if i have any issues i'll put in the video but i'll do an install i might do a small driving impression as far as the dampers but we won't be able to really exploit the car's handling until i get a proper alignment which is necessary after installing a new suspension i'm not sure where i'm going to get an alignment yet because of the chronovirus so we'll see when i can get that so i can give a real driving impression but without further ado um let's throw these on the car and um yeah all right so to undo suspension is pretty easy you just undo the end link here easiest way is a 14 millimeter gear wrench so you can ratchet it and then you need to put an allen key on the middle of the stud on the other side um so we undo the sway bar make sure the both sides of the cars are up so there's no tension on the sway bar undo these and then there are only three up top and we should be able to drop these uh old megans so quick comparison of the old versus new here's my old blonde mcgann easy streets new s3 suspension we're gonna have to move the um uh oem end link which i've been using to attach to the sway bar as you can see these are nice and crusty let's see the top comparison we've got crusty top versus pillow ball this is a rubber or two so um gonna be big changes coming up soon so here's what i was talking about you got to put the allen key in the back here and then a gear wrench makes this really easy to remove so that you can just ratchet it to undo it i also just noticed that these come with new nut okay so checkpoint we did the rear as you can see it came with these new nuts i said that before everything fit perfectly fine i still haven't put the adjustment knob i pushed the top of the camber thing all the way and it looks like we're getting more than three degrees which is good because i want to run four degrees or something in the back so camera adjustment looks good enough without having to get arms probably so that was easy everything fit fine now i will move to the fronts alright guys so i just installed the fronts you guys can see here we have that nice camber plate um it looks like i'm gonna have to remove the strut bar before i go get an alignment because it looks like it's a little bit hard to adjust with a trd strap bar on here it is underneath all installed install was really easy everything bolted up just fine i haven't torqued everything down yet all this is here bolts up nicely yeah so as far as fit and finish we have no issues um i have had friends that bought coilovers before that just didn't fit like straight up um there's the my friend hen got the i think his fortune coilovers when they first dropped and they didn't even fit on his car like at all um but this one had no fit and finish issues um all the bolts like this i mean i guess they provided it but it all lines up perfectly fine um everything threaded fine the brake line and stuff all fit fine so i'm just gonna wrap it up and do the other side um i'm not sure if i'm gonna take it for a test drive it's like 10 p.m and there's no alignment um but yeah just putting everything back together and we should be good to go but as far as initial impressions as far as like fit and finish i say 10 out of 10 i had no issues all right guys so i just finished installing these last night i was able to take it around the block and hit some speed bombs pretty hard and there seems to be no issues so far the car rides really smooth even though it has a stiffer spring rate so that's a good thing that means the dampers are doing their job so the differences i noticed at least last night and just driving around the block is i can slam the brakes when the car isn't diving like it used to and like side to side is more stable yet when i hit a bump it doesn't when it lands like from the speed bump it doesn't like oscillate which is what i was looking for so but then again i haven't done any real testing yet because we don't have an alignment um and we are going to get one tomorrow um here i put my crappy tires on because it's not aligned but it looks like you're getting a good amount of camber i push the top parts as far in as i can to max out the camber on the bottom part of the strut before the alignment so we'll see how that goes you guys can see the camber here it's really tilted um yeah i'm glad it has some camber um so i will let you guys know um you'll probably see me test drive i don't know if it'll be a separate separate video yet um no autocrosses are coming up either so we're gonna have to just try it on some back roads but so far so good um all right guys so i finally got the mrs aligned and threw on my good tires again it had the crappy all seasons on when i drove it there so we got the tires on and now i'm gonna go play with the damping right now i've driven it on the freeway and hit some really big bumps and i'm really impressed with how the damping is but now i'm gonna take it out on some back roads the sticky tires and i'm just going to play with the damping maybe i'm going to max it out and then run it um full soft and stuff like that just to see how big of a difference the damping adjustment really makes i believe these are 32 way adjustable so we'll just max it out and then then set it to where i actually want it to sit um right now i have the rear at plus six front at plus three just from freeway driving and pushing it around with all seasons but now we have sticky tires on so i have a feeling i'm gonna have to turn it up just a little bit okay so right now i turn the dampers to maximum stiff and i just want to show you guys how stiff um it can actually get so when it's stiff this is all rebound dampened because it's one way adjustable so that means that you're really slowing down the speed at which it can return or push down as far as like rebound to like expand so right now it's maximum tightness the biggest indicator of how bouncy it is is if you listen to my throttle over the bumps because i have a lot of exhaust my foot will be shaking and the car will probably make a shaking sound when it's bouncing so this is maximum stiffness you can see my maximum stiffness we're getting cars really responsive because it's so tight but it's a little [Music] hear bouncy that's that's because the car is over damp because we're at the maximum stiffness but here on the smooth road it's really responsive so what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna um i'm gonna turn the damping down to the settings that i made um from just going back and forth we're gonna turn it back to plus three front and plus six in the rear right now it's maximum 32 32. you can see the car will hop a bit because there's no too much rebound damping on the bumps so what i'm going to do now again is turn into plus three and then plus six in the rear and i'm going to show you how much um the damping difference changes it so um overall when the car is on full soft it's really supple and smooth um it's the spring rate isn't what causes cars well i mean to an extent the spring rate will make a car bumpy but it's either like over damping or like too little damping too little damping the car will oscillate and kind of float too much as the car is hopping like this so what i'm gonna do is turn it to plus three plus six and you guys can hear and probably see uh how much smoother drives because we're on um a normal road not a race track so you're gonna the road does have imperfections so i tuned the damper to what i was feeling early on so now i set the damping to plus three plus six rear and the reason the rear is higher is because there's a higher spring rate in the rear it's 12k for under 7k so it needs more to resist the strength of the spring pushing like uh down so this is the exact same [Music] road and here the throttle is smooth and these coilovers are really good so let's slam on the brakes [Music] so you can see the car doesn't dive uh [Music] 7k spring right in the front the car doesn't dive as hard as it used to and it's a really good spring for the front those are the same okay so we're not gonna push it that hard i'm just going to get a feel for the braking and the rolling and the overall damping right now i love it it's way better than it was before so we're just going to give it a little spirited go here and just see how it goes [Applause] [Applause] oh so overall that 7k 12k car is not bouncy that's not the spring rate doesn't make the car bouncy it's the quality of the damper usually and i guess these dampers are at least way better than my big fans all right so i'm back from setting the damping settings for the car overall my impression as far as how it did out on the normal road is it's really great the 7k 12k is not too much at all if you guys think it's bumpy with a rate less than that it's probably because the damper isn't doing its job or there's maybe not enough travel on your suspension setup so these are swift springs swift springs are actually thinner which means there's more space between the spring coils themselves so it does have more um like kind of in a way more travel not like as the lengthwise but it holds the same rate while having more distance between each coil and that's one of the advantages of swiss springs which this has so now that i'm done with my setting for normal driving i usually write it here i had an old piece of tape here before so the front is plus three and then rear is plus six for the rear and this is for um street and then i'll put my autocross settings there um when we get to that and then um we're also going to be taking this at the track now finally that i have a roll bar so i'll be able to write down my settings there and figure out how it does in those settings but right now on the street if you guys buy the same spring rate as me i would suggest um plus three front plus six rear and again since these are one-way adjustable like most one-way adjustable suspension coilover systems you are adjusting the rebound setting so that is the the damping force when the spring uh ex pushes outward instead of compressing so that's what the damping does when you do one-way adjustable suspension but um overall really liked it um you guys can see the adjustment knobs here i don't know if i showed that before but yeah um overall i do recommend um this was a sponsored video and a sponsored product i did get this as a sponsored item but i did get it um already and i have no um obligation to give it a good review honestly i already got the product so i could pretty much walk away with free springs but um yeah overall honestly it was a really good suspension setup for the price you guys could see the difference in damping when it was maximum stiff it definitely made the cars really stiff and it's really responsive in transition so i'm excited to try that on autocross course but yeah the damping does work when you turn it down it just soars over the gaps on back roads so that's good what else i think my spring rate so far as far as trying it out um the car feels a lot more predictable because it's not leaning as much and it's not diving as hard as it used to so it feels a lot more flat without playing with the sway bars i didn't change the sway bar settings from my old settings but um yeah overall pretty excited to try this out in different settings and i'm overall very happy with the suspension so thank you s3 for the suspension and um hope you guys can look forward to me going to some events if they start opening things up but anyways i hope you guys enjoyed the video and i will see you in the next one", "PSIEb8FLK4M": "uh colleagues friends ladies and gentlemen my name is dr chaudhary and on behalf of the nafld conclave and the indian national association for the study of liver i welcome you to this fourth conclave that is the fourth year of the conclave and this happens to be the fifth webinar of this year as we had promised last time this year this particular webinar is dedicated to very practical managements of making diet and exercise work for nafld patients you know all of us seem to know that it's something to do with the lifestyle but that's the part which is most ignored be it in our prescription or date in our prescribing manners or date in the guidance that we give to patients and as a part of a general public policy or lifestyle but that's where the fulcrum the crux of the matter is so we are too obsessed with medicines this webinar is all about trying to make diet and exercise work for your natural patients and we have very eminent people to take us through this they'll be introduced to you but let me first welcome the three chairpersons three hepatologists of great eminence first is dr y k chawla dr chawla doesn't need any introduction he was the head of hepatology and thereafter the director at pgi chandigarh and he's one of the best known names in this field in the world then we have dr anil anand ac anand who had a wonderful brilliant career as a gastroenterologist in the defense forces they retired as a vice admiral and at this point he is serving as a professor of gastroenterology at hepatology in bhuvaneshwar in kalinga institute he is of course a prolific researcher and a writer and a very cerebral person and the third is none other than dr kaushal madan dr kaushal madan has had many roles and hats been a very great academic at this point he's in a max hospital as the chief of hepatology but more importantly he's the secretary general of the indian national association for study of liver so the three chairpersons will take us through and we have a galaxy of wonderful speakers and i'll now pass it on to them uh just one point that i had to make uh we have tried to take your feedback and keep this session as much as possible in a case-based format so most of our discussions will be revolving around case examples and what we have learned or what we can offer by way of learning and at the end of it i'll take the liberty of making a five-minute presentation on certain hacks and strategies and charts and tricks or links that you can share as a part of your practice when you're guiding patients with methods so with with that over to dr chawla dr anand and dr kaushal thank you gore it's very interesting uh going to be very interesting today and we have some important points to be discussed and the first speaker uh to us is dr professor ashish kumar who has already been introduced to you by professor gore chaudhary i believe arun sanyal has not yet joined us so i'll request ashish to give the first talk so ashish is going to talk to us on the role of diet and nafld can i can i in the meantime just put things in perspective because dr arun sunil has not joined so in today's webinar we thought of three or four aspects of lifestyle as we know one of them is diet which forms a very crucial role in how to shed weight and how to reduce fat the other is going to be the role of exercise how do we do it as a part of a program or as a part of our day to day lives and the third which is a very new emerging concept is the role of sleep and the circadian rhythm and does it have a role to play in fatty liver disease so our much of our discussion will be on these three lines obviously our opening issue would be diet and with that we have dr ashish to first address us on the role of that thank you good evening ladies and gentlemen thank you dr chavla for the introduction and i at the outset i would like to thank dr chaudhary for inviting me here so can i have my slides can i have the first slide so i bring you greetings from sargangaram hospital so i'll be talking about role of diet in nafld so i'll directly come to the case yeah so this was a 47 year old gentleman from delhi a punjabi guy who was a businessman he had an automobile accessory shop and he had a sedentary lifestyle so he would sit in his shop from 9am to 9pm and he said that he was here did not have any time for exercise he had mainly vegetarian diet although he was non-vegetarian but most of the time he consumed vegetarian diet and he was non-alcoholic so he presented with chief complaints of fatigue for last three months pain in abdomen which is was mild and mainly located in the right upper quadrant for last one month so these were his complaints he was diagnosed to have hypertension about one year ago for which he was on medications but he would of often skip those and on examination i found only hepatomegaly and no other positive finding his anthropometric that data was that his height was 5 feet 8 inches weight was 90 kg and the bmi was around 90. so his investigations uh his hemoglobin hemogram was unremarkable in his liver function test only ast and alt were elevated two to three times um in his kidney function test uric acid was slightly elevated uh hepatitis b and c viral markers were negative thyroid was normal hb a1c was slightly elevated in the pre-diabetes range that is 6.2 ultrasound showed a grade 2 fatty liver and his fibro scan showed liver stiffness of 8.8 kilopascal and the control attenuation parameter that is fat content 358 which was high so we made a diagnosis of non-alcoholic state of hepatitis with liver fibrosis hypertension liver fibrosis because of slightly elevated liver stiffness measurement here hypertension pre-diabetes obesity and hyperuricemia so what we prescribed was weight reduction uh through lifestyle modification uh dietary counseling exercise and few drugs these were the drugs and so i began with the dietary counseling so on asking him he mainly said that he does not consume any junk food he takes only food prepared at home so on digging further i wanted to ask what exactly he consumed so this was the diet he gave be told so he in the morning he used to take tea with two teaspoons of sugar and two biscuits breakfast was aloo paratha two little curd and one sweet lassi lunch was basically two chapatis rice a dal and curry evening snacks he would had have in his shop only that was uh one tea and a samosa or bread pakoda whatever was available nearby his shop dinner was same as his lunch chapati rice curry and dal and at bedtime he would con take one glass of milk with sugar so this is the diet he used to take and this is what the diet most of the north indians would take and we all would relate to this diet so there's no extra junk food like pizza burger or anything else so i would now there's something wrong in this diet so i would like an audience to respond to this so i want the audience poll to run now can audience polls come so my question is what do what is wrong is there too many calories too too much of carbohydrate too little protein fiber and all so can we have the result just give me a moment please yeah okay so most of them said that they are too many calories and too much of carbohydrate and too much of fat but i'll tell you whatever the response you all gave all of them are correct so can i have my slides back okay so all the responses were correct in fact he was consuming too many calories too much carbohydrate too little protein too lit little fiber and too much of fat uh regarding fat i'll come to it so what is the calorie content of his diet so in the morning he was taking approximately 130 calories uh with 80 calories of biscuits 30 of the sugar breakfast because of the aloo paratha it was about 785 calorie lunch 664 calorie evening snack 6 410 again dinner of the same uh 664 and bedtime 190 calories so total he was consuming 2843 calorie and this is too high for a sedentary individual according to the guy try dietary guidelines for a sedentary individual of between 31 to 50 age that the dietary advice is to consume 2200 to 2400 calorie and he was consuming 400 to 500 calorie more than what is required now let us look at a little more detail of his calorie breakup so he was consuming 60 percent of the calories in form of carbs 27 in form of fat and 13 of protein the recommended carbohydrate intake should be 50 30 and protein 20 percent so what he was consuming uh as fat although percentage was okay but the amount was high regarding protein the percentage was also low and the amount was also low and carb was way too much amount as well as the percentage was high so he was consuming about 432 gram of carbohydrate so let us see what is the effect of carbohydrate so if someone consumes just 0 to 50 grams of carbohydrates this is what the people prescribe in ketogenic diet it leads to ketosis and fat burning so it is it may be helpful for people with insulin resistance if we increase the carbohydrate to 50 to 100 grams this is good for people who are not exercising and it is easy to keep a weight off if you're consuming this much for 100 to 150 gram is okay for those people who are active and healthy but if carbohydrate content is 150 to 300 gram it is slightly higher than what is required but it could be okay depending on your activity level or insulin sensitivity but anything more than 300 grams this is far too much and this drives the insulin resistance and our guy was consuming about approximately 432 grams which was too much so for a normal healthy individual if he is consuming 2 000 kilocalorie diet approximately two half of them should come from carbohydrate so approximately 250 gram is a okay amount but our patient was consuming far too much but not only that amount of carbohydrates a type of carbohydrate is also important so there are three types of carbs one is sugars the other is starch and third is fiber sugars are simple sugars like glucose sucrose fructose which are very easily digested and absorbed then starch are cereals and potatoes and examples of fibers are vegetables and whole grains which are very difficult to digest and absorb so what happens if we consume excess amount of sugar so sugar in the form of sucrose or fructose containing sugar if we consume excess amount and if we are not able to metabolize it rapidly or i mean use it rapidly then it is all converted to fat and this is called as denovo lipogenesis and this accumulates in the liver in the form of triglycerides it causes liver toxicity in the form of sleep hepatitis and it is also exported away from the liver and goes uh to the various parts of the body including heart and it poses a risk of cardiovascular diseases and there have been multiple reviews and studies which have proved that fructose and sugars are the main mediators of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease animals studies have shown that even a small amount of daily intake of carb sugar sweetened beverages can lead to fatty liver sugars and in the framingham heart study it was shown that those people who consume lot of sugar sweetened beverage we're at higher risk of fatty liver disease and it was also shown that if you replace your alcoholic beverage with sugar sweetened beverages the result is same and you'll have got same amount of fatty liver and multiple meta-analysis have also been done which have shown that sugar is the driver for your fatty liver and if you uh it is it has got dose dependent effect the more you consume sugars beverages you have more chances of having fatty liver disease and in even in animal experiment it has been shown that it is high sugar but not high fat diet which leads to hepatic fatty deposit so this in this animal experiment there were two groups of animals one was given high sugar diet one was given one group were given high fat diet those animals which received high sugar diet had increased weight increased leptin content increased insulin and various up regulation of transcription factors but those animals which received only high fat diet only the weight was higher and leptin was higher but there was no such changes in insulin level or transcription factors so it is the sugar which mainly drives the hepatic metabolism and what is the amount of sugar which is recommended according to american heart association the men should not consume more than 50 calories of sugar that is 9 teaspoonful and women should not consume more than 100 calories that is 6 teaspoonful and if you have diabetes metabolic syndrome fatty liver obesity it is better to avoid totally or at least less than five percent of your total calorie intake should be in the form of added sugar coming to other types of carbohydrate that is cereal starch and vegetables and whole grains so when we are discussing this type of carbohydrate we should know about glycemic index glycemic index is the amount of glucose which is raised after consuming uh that amount of carbohydrate so there are two types of carbohydrate one which causes a rapid rise in glucose level and consequently insulin level and one which is leads to a slow rise in glucose level in the blood because it is very slowly absorbed so the rise in the insulin will be low so what is the effect of high glycemic index food if you consume a lot of high glycemic index food the sugar in the blood will rise rapidly and with the consequent increase in insulin level it will fall down fast and at the point where the sugar level in the blood will decrease you'll feel hunger pangs and you'll again consume high glycemic index food so this is you will end up eating much more but if you consume a low glycemic index food the the energy would be released slowly the carbohydrate or glucose will be released slowly and there will be no uh ups and downs in the sugar level so it you'll feel fuller and you will eventually eat less so it has been shown by animal experiments that those animals which have been given rapidly absorbed carbohydrate as compared to slowly absorb carbohydrate they developed weight gain and also had fatty liver as compared to those who had slowly absorbed carbohydrate and this has also been shown in meta-analysis that low glycemic index diet is a good intervention when we are trying to reduce weight but not just glycemic index glycemic load is also important so what is glycemic load so for example watermelon it has the glycemic index of 72 which is quite high and white rice which is a glycemic index of 58 but what we do we if we consume 120 gram of white rice the carbohydrate load would be 33.5 and the glycemic load would be 19 while 120 gram of serving of watermelon will only have 9 gram of carbohydrate so glycemic load will be less that is 6.5 so for same amount that is glycemic load of 19.4 one serving of serving of white rice would be equivalent to three serving of watermelon so actually good even though glycemic index of uh rye white rice is lesser than that of watermelon but because there's a lot of carbohydrate the load is much important and this is categorized into three category so anything which is more than 20 of glycemic load is high moderate is 11 to 19 and low is 0 to 10 so what are the diets for example white rice has got very high glycemic index 27 white pasta french fries baked potato and all this moderate is whole wheat pasta brown rice sweet potato and vegetables are obviously have got lower glycemic load and they are much better so for uh so when we advise so instead of using maida or the usual atta or the wheat flour it is much better to use whole white wheat flour or a multi grain flour because these have a low glycemic index as well as low glycemic load similarly rice is compared to white rice brown rice is much better and even better is the black rice and the red rice because they have got low glycemic index and they have much higher fiber content coming to the fat so when we are buying cooking oil for ourselves what are the factors we should look when choosing a cooking oil we should look for saturated fat in the labels trans fat unsaturated fat especially mufasa and pufa mufasa monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acid omega 3 and omega 6 ratio cholesterol content smoking point of the oil and whether the oil is refined or cold pressed so without going too much detail i would advise you that you buy oil which is has got saturated content of less than 10 percent trans fat should preferably be zero because multiple studies have shown that it is bad for health mono and saturated fatty acid and the saturated should be replaced by both mufa and pufa and of them mufa is better and among the uh omega 6 and omega 3 types of pufa omega 3 is much better cholesterol content should preferably be zero or as low as possible we should check the smoking point of oil that is the at which temperature it uh becomes bad and um if we have to choose between refined oil and the cold pressed oil cold pressed oil is much better because it has got better content but when we are talking about fat it is not just fat we have other fats in other food items also so we should avoid trans fat totally saturated fat as much as possible and we should eat unsaturated fat much more for example avocados fish cold water fish olive oil and the nuts so when choosing oil it is much better to have olive oil are much better and uh there's been an interesting study like uh which showed that cooking oil also leads to a change in the glycemic response of rice so this was an interesting study where they chose three types of rice they chose four types of cooking oil and when was the cooking oil added and they showed that a red rice when cooked with rice bran oil was much better as compared to other cooking oil and other types of rice coming to the protein although there's the data is limited it is recommended that 20 percent of calories should become from protein this is 1.5 gram per kg and the best source is either fat and dairy or soy protein and protein increases the satiety and also makes us full and so we consume the low calorie because of protein so coming back to our patient so first the dietary prescription we gave is to reduce his calorie content from 2800 to 2000 calorie and also from 60 percent of carbs which was he was consuming we reduced his carbs content to about 50 percent only 1000 kilocalorie that is 250 gram if we reduce the fat amount we increase the protein amount and apart from dietary con counseling we gave him various drugs like sarah glitters or vitamin e tell me saturn for his hypertension and foreign uric acid fabric stat and we ensured that he come came regular for his regular follow-up visits regular counseling and periodic blood tests were done and most important thing we tried to ensure that he adhered to his diet and at six months his weight was down from 90 to 81 his bmi reduced to 27 asd and alt became almost normal uric acid came down to normal and hp 1c also normalized ultrasound now showed a slightly less grade of fatty liver and his cap also came down and the most important thing is his fibrosis level also came down from 8.8 to 7.3 so another audience poll here so what led to his reduction improvement in liver fibrosis is it weight reduction vitamin uh e sarroglatazor or is it just a lab error so can i have the pole again so yes everyone is right his weight reduction was the main driver of improvement in liver fibrosis can i have my slides back so this was also proven by one of our our own study where we gave sarogletazo to about hundreds can we skip this i think we are running well behind time hashish so i'll just uh yeah so this is my assembly slide this is the dietary recommendation for non-alcoholic c to hepatitis we should reduce the calorie diet to about seven so that the fee the person achieved seven to ten percent of weight loss and for this we have to reduce the calorie content by 500 to 1000 calorie we should try to adhere to low carb diet that is 50 percent of the calorie should comes from carbohydrate not more than and of which the added sugar should be as low as possible and so we if we are buying any food from the store we should check the label as how much of the added sugar it has the carb the diet the from the diet should be about 30 and we should try to give 20 percent of protein that is 1.5 kilo gram of protein per kg body weight avoid fructose containing drinks substitute saturated fatty acids with poly or monounsaturated fatty acids prefer oil which has more health benefits increase the soy and protein content of the food and increase fiber intake and most important is ensure adherence so this is the my summary slide and with this i thank you for patient hearing and i would love to have questions thank you ashish i think uh gore since uh dr arun sanyal has come would you like so we can formally welcome maroon to the group uh we started off without you hey good morning goodbye you know the time changed at midnight yeah because yeah i know but you know when you are woken up suddenly in the morning early morning you get up remembering your sleep was it a nightmare or a pleasant sleep why was sanjit's phone i will leave the rest to you to imagine okay fine so i've more or less outlined what we are going through so we had our opening batsman can you have to remember that it woke up my wife as well at 5 00 a.m a bit of a nightmare never mind yes me now okay thanks a lot i think that was a very beautiful talk i wish we had a full one hour to discuss it you're done your research very well as you always do very enlightening talk over to the chairpersons we go on to the next piece right so thank you ashish for that wonderful presentation and emphasizing the fact that you have to reduce the calorie intake and now to debate you on whether it's the low carb diet or low fat diet which would help reduce enough calories in patients of nafld we have dr eileen candy she is the head of department and dietetics department of nutrition and nitric acid reliance foundation hospital and research center dr eileen please so uh so you want me to begin with it i thought uh dr ashish was big beginning with the carbohydrate part so i already made my point that you made okay yeah you have to reduce the total calorie as well as the carbohydrate content which is much high in the indian diet which is about 60 to 56 percent which will bring down to less than 50 that is my point so the sugars and the parathas and the chapatis are happy things okay so i hope you all can see my slideshare and i'll start uh basically we are going to be talking about fat and what you need to know about fat versus the carbs uh that is uh given in the diet now uh there is one thing which um i would like to you know actually question is low carb diet to treat a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease uh does it make sense and yes for some reason this is not moving okay okay sorry about that okay so does it make sense so why is having much fat in the liver a bad thing so most individuals with nafld have an increased abdominal fat which we all know insulin resistance triglycerides cholesterol and they may have other comorbidities like hypertension or diet type 2 diabetes so i'm sure by now you have guessed it right that it might be that nafld is caused by eating too much of that or it is caused by eating too much of the wrong things so it may not necessarily be only the fact so however there are increased dietary fat consumption might play a causative role in the nafld we have all read about it we know about it however there are studies that have shown that only 15 of the liver fat is actually derived from dietary fat now uh adipose tissue is a major source of fatty acids found in the liver and the peripheral insulin resistance increase of fatty acids in the liver or the adipose tissue is all because of basically a lot of underlying other causes and there could be even very low density like root protein so directly fat as uh cause of nafld could be something that we we need to ask ourselves and there are various studies which suggest that it is also the weight loss that is beneficial with the patients in fald and not necessarily only the reduction of carbohydrates so when you tell somebody to lose weight in the real world it's very limited because it's not very easy we understand that because lifestyle modification is yes the basis of calorie reduction and which is achieved but what happens in most of the patients you find the adherence to the diet or to the weight loss is is very limited people find it difficult and they struggle to maintain their weight loss so what is the actual solution to the nafld issues so of course the main stray of the therapy nafld is weight loss dietary modifications but when we talk about diets you you all may have heard of various types of diets that are there you know and the question comes are there some diets better than the others okay so what are the different types of diets that we are looking at in the market or in the uh you know in what people are doing so it's become like one social uh uh thing you know when you go for your kitty parties like oh yes what diet are you following now are you following the low carb diet are you following low fat diet are you doing keto are you not doing keto or if she's doing keto even i want to do keto so you know there are so many diets the dash diet now mediterranean diet which is like so uh so much talked about but in india how much can we actually follow the mediterranean diet type so that becomes a question i was trying to look at a lot of scientific data which uh talks about fat and uh whether actually reducing a lot of fat makes a difference in the diet and i there were many studies which showed that it is not only the uh the the amount of fat that you eat but it's also the kind of fat you eat so if you look at the modified mediterranean diet if you look at the fat percentage which is 45 percent high and move for fat so it's not that they have removed the fat fat is there they have also tried to see whether fat or sources adding extra virgin oil makes a difference or adding rapeseed oil makes a difference or adding other kind of oils makes a difference so these are some of the studies which shows that you know adding omega-3 fatty acids which is also a fatty acid makes a difference to nafld now what is the problem in india so fats and fatty acids in india is it a is it time for us to seriously introspect and think that are we using the right oil or are we using the right methods of cooking for oil and one of it which very comes out very strongly is the effect of heating reading of fats and that are used mostly in our cooking so that is something where you got to look at now when i talk about the quality of fat we say that uh you have to give good quality fat and when we talk about good quality quality fat we talk about the omega 3 talk about vitamin e uh roll of vitamin e that's a fat soluble vitamins and we talk about vitamin d again it's a fat soluble vitamin so when you're talking about good quality fats you also talk about the other aspects of fat now before i could end my uh talk uh today i would just like to ask uh everybody one question that we have our macronutrients are just three carbohydrates proteins and fats now when you talk about removing one that is your carbohydrate from your diet or reducing your carbohydrate from your diet what are you left with you're left with two main macronutrients that is your fat and your proteins now if uh i go by what dr ashish has to say that fat proteins have to be 15 or say 20 of your total calories what remains is fat so then how are you going to feed the people how are you going to feed the person whom you're trying to advise a diet so are you going to say that you have to you have to add fat because if you remove carbs you restrict proteins to some extent then what remains is fat so when we actually talk about the dietary part of it we have to remember one thing that when we talk about carbohydrates in the diet we have to talk about carbohydrates which is like bound with fiber bound with vitamins minerals and what we have to remove is only the refined sources of carbohydrates we need to keep carbohydrates because if this person is already sarcopenic you may land up making this person even more sarcopenic when you try to reduce your weight with removing lots of carbs what will happen the body will start using proteins as its source for energy and what happens to that because you're using proteins as your source of energy you start losing your muscle mass and that's when you get more sarcopenic so when i say that you have to have a balance it means that do not remove too much of your carbs at the same time the total calorie consumption is very important like what uh what is given is what you take a history you understand that yes this person is eating up to 3000 calories but does that person actually require 3000 calories is the question so how to find out how much the person requires because everybody's requirement is different so first of all the first step of doing a proper diet is find out his actual consumption that he would be requiring for his daily expenditure so in the total actual expenditure if he is consuming if he requires 1800 calories per day as a total energy expenditure you calculate backward calculate from that so if you say 50 of the 1800 calories then the remaining is divided into fat and protein so with this i uh would actually want to ask her one more question again a low carb diet to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease now does it make sense thank you thank you dr ali dr ashish would you like to respond maybe a minute yeah so i think both of us said the same thing i i did not say to remove the carbohydrates totally i just said that what we are actually eating is too much of carbs uh like the patient i showed he was eating about 60 to 65 percent of his calorie intake in the form of carb and his calorie content was also too high that was a eating approximately 3000 calorie so what we did we brought down his calorie content to about 2000 according to his activity level and we brought down his carbohydrate content to 50 50 is what is actually the good balance and the rest of the amount was the rest of the 50 we divided equally into protein and the fat so this is what we said so from too much of carbs bring down to 50 percent i'm not saying to bring down to too low yeah so when we talk about keto diets basically we are actually bringing the carb downs to very very low uh you know less than 100 grams so that's uh that's the point which we should be able to counsel the patient well as to what is the low level of low carbs that we are looking at thank you when we are talking about keto diet this this is a different ball game because then we are depending on the ketones and we are so this is different but in a usual diet when we prescribe to an nfld patients we just advise him to reduce the calorie content and the carbs to about 50 thank you eileen and thank you dr ashish for giving us a very good interesting debate on whether the carbohydrate or fat which is more important i'm sure there will be many questions on this because finally you have said the same thing and made it into form of a debate we now move on to the second aspect of lifestyle modification and that is the exercise and to give us an intro overview of this is dr charles spiritual he is the senior consultant gastroenterologist and hepatologist at esther middle medici hospital coaching very popular and very very innovative gastroenterologist and he is going to talk to us exercise for reducing any effect also and for that kind words and persons uh teachers senior consultants and friends exercise has got prior tropical action in non-chronic fatigue disease and as clinicians we have to learn to incorporate it into our treatment algorithm of nfld let's go through a few case scenarios we have a 58 year old banker by profession who has got metabolic syndrome had a recent ptca has got osteoarthritis he is obese with a bmi of 32.5 and is referred to for evaluation of grade 1 fatty liver on ultrasound you find that he has got a d range lft light account is one like 65 000 you rule out secondary causes and you stay make a diagnosis of non-hypothyroid fatty liver disease you state the disease and find that he has got significant fibrosis a second case that we commonly see in our practice is a 30 year old i.t professional who comes for his annual checkup is find that he has got a impact for fasting glucose his triglycerides are 278 his uric acid is 8.6 milligram percent his hdl is 76 and his sdp is 98 and his ust shows a grade to fatty liver the patient has no commodities you rule out his own secondary causes make a diagnosis in nfd and these are the two common scenarios we see now in our clinical practice and let us see how we can incorporate exercise into the treatment algorithm and before i go further can i have my questions sorry i'm not taking the questions huh so this is the first question to you both aerobic and resistance exercises produce significant reduction in intraoperative triglyceride level is it true or false so you know you've got different types of exercises aerobic resistance high intensity interval training so do they all produce same same amount of production in that entrepreneurial straight level or is there any difference can i have a second question so second question vigorous exercise without dietary restrictions lead to significant weight loss and ingredient in escort and fibrosis is it true or false so can you achieve significant weight loss and improvement in inflammation fibrosis with vigorous exercise alone without associated concomitant dietary restrictions so we'll come back to answers later can i go back to my slides please so lifestyle interventions in the form of diet physical activity and exercise leads to significant improvement in nash you can achieve it about 64 improvement in nash as well as 50 improvement in fibrosis and you should know that it's much more than what is achieved by the newer drugs in phase 3 trials but the problem is here only 10 to 20 of your patients in clinical practice achieve more than 10 weight loss so you have to know how to incorporate it into your clinical practice and how to get your patient to adopt and adhere to it so sedentary behavior no physical activity and poor diet all the three hits together causes metabolic syndrome and we studies have shown that sitting for more than three hours a day increase all cost mortality by more than one with a relative risk of 1.30 and we also know that each sedentary hour leads to one point one five percent increase in tripathic trimester level and the study by healy and colleagues showed that interruptions in sedentary life suddenly time is beneficial for weight control glucose reduction and triglyceride reduction and you can incorporate interruptions in sedentary behavior to complement your physical activity and exercise guidelines so that's the first step in your management of your patient nfld your ops banker who is probably sitting throughout the day in his office you can ask him to interrupt stand up every hour ask him to use a app or a gadget that reminds him to stand up everyone every hour take a few steps so that interrupting the secondary time will complement the physical activity and exercise guidelines same goes with it professionals who sit throughout day in and day out in front of a computer ask them to keep reminders so that they get a paid hour and take a few steps and that means a lot to the improvement in intraoperative trigger stress and fat now coming to physical activity it is various guidelines are recommended that this should have at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week or 10 000 steps per day to reduce the metabolic risk factors and this study by halwa and colleagues from newcastle has shown that daily physical activity is significantly less impatient with nfld and the same group also showed that if you have short boards of physical activity it can be as good as long about some moderate intensity exercise so you're coming back your obese banker who's got a coronary disease but osteoarthritis who is not able to do long boards or moderate intensity exercise it's a good news for him he can do short bouts of physical activity get a walk a few minutes walk for three to four minutes at least throughout the day you can split it into short boats of physical activity throughout the day so at the end of the day you achieve around 40 to 45 minutes of physical life that's a good news for us for the anger with over cardiovascular disorder and coming into exercise exercise has shown a modest but clinically meaningful improvement in fat but you can get about 20 to 30 percent related reduction in fat with exercise alone but if you combine exercise with with diet and you can achieve a ten percent weight loss then you can achieve sas 80 to 100 percent improvement in fat and how does exercise act exercise acts mainly by improving the insulin sensorization it reduces the visceral in the liver it reduces renewable liposynthesis it improves it increases the beta oxidation of pre fat as it enters the liver and it also increases the separation of vldn by the liver so free fatty acids that comes in the liver gets more gets oxidized and more gets separated out as vldl so let's gets deposited in the liver so it mainly acts by increasing the insulin sensitization and to incorporate exercise into algorithm you should know what type of exercise do you use what those exercises use and how to practically implement it and let's see what the data says this slide summarizes all the prospective studies that has done with exercise in nfld and this from the ints processing statement on an fnd that is published in 2019 and you can see that most of the studies showed significant reduction in interoperability drivers rights and that was independent of weight changes but problem with all these studies is that these are small number of patients short duration 6 to 12 weeks and they looked really at fair they did not look at inflammation or fibrosis that's a drawback of all these studies and this is a meta-analysis by cancer county that is published in 2017 again 564 patients indefinitely divided into two groups the intervention arm and the control arm and they showed that that the exercise significantly reduces fat independent of the weight class sorry now coming to what type of exercise you use we know you have got aerobic you have got resistance and you have got high intensity exercises this is a study by johnson and colleagues who looked at aerobic exercise in 21 obese nfl patients compared to controls and they found that aerobic exercise at their probably there was a 21 reduction in the treatment on compared to the control arm so aerobic exercise definitely a reducer interfering triglycerides and the newcastle group in 2011 published a data on resident exercises in effective russian skills in fact and they showed that there was a modest but clinically significant reduction in intraparty triglycerides with resistance exercise alone they got a 13 reduction compared to controls and that was modest but still it was clinically seemingly clinically significant and this is a meta-analysis of all the studies comparing aerobic and resistance exercises that was published by harshad in 2017 and that analysis showed that both aerobic and resistance is equally effective in reducing dramatic fat and there was no uh clinical significant difference between aerobic and resistance exercise this is a good news for your obese gentleman the obese bangle because it doesn't have the cardiovascular reserve to do aerobic exercise you can start with the resistance exercise you ask them to take short bowels or resistance exercises and gradually build it up whereas your young id professional he might be happy to do a aerobic or a high intensity interval training if it doesn't have time for a long duration of aerobic exercises so you've got a wide variety of exercise regimes to choose from and you have to choose wisely so that your patient attains to the regime and coming to the intensity what's the intensity of exercise and nfl your role of intensity of exercise this is a study by saying that compared moderate intensity exercise was vigorous exercise and showed that both moderate intensity and vigorous exercises produce similar reduction in the interoperability rights so the intensity of the exercise doesn't matter either moderate both moderate and vigorous exercises can reduce interoperability to the same level and again keating they divided 48 patients into four groups that is high intensity low volume group low in the sky growing group and low intensity low volume group and a control group and they showed that even in patients in the low intensity low volume group had a better had significant clinical symptom reduction in the interoperability compared to the controller that's a patient who did not do exercise and that's again a good news for is for your obese banker because even my exercise the lowering low intensity exercises can help him to clear his fat you can start with alolium low intensity exercise aerobic exercise and slowly work his way up coming to nash as i said there are no studies looking at the inflammation of fibrosis in fibrosis in exercising inflammation of fibrosis all the studies looked at a combination diet and exercise and those studies that achieved at 7-10 percent weight loss had significant reduction in inflammation and fibrosis and only study that looked at regression of fibrosis in with exercise is published as a abstract in the 2018 esl that's the study by or government they showed that 58 percent of their patients had at least one point reduction in fibrosis operator with aerobic exercise so aerobic exercise might at all intensive aerobic exercise might help in reducing fibrosis but that needs further studies so to summarize exercise is a polyp in for the management of nfld we just need to learn how to get how to get patients to take it regularly and seriously and let's see how we can implement it so that when you prescribe an exercise the exercise should promote adoption and long term adherence it should be acceptable to your patient and it will be achievable by the patient you can start slow and gradually work your way up in your opis gentleman you can start by giving breaks to sedentary lifestyle getting asking you to get up and move more and take more steps and reach the world of 10 000 steps per day and gradually add in a restaurant exercise and then add in the low volume low intensity exercise and gradually work your way up whereas in your young gentleman who is probably physically fit you can ask him to do either a aerobic exercise or a high density interval training depending upon its time and so as already we have seen we can choose between a wide variety of exercise regimes to be chosen from either aerobic or resistance or high energy interval training and you can ask a patient to start slow you can add 75 minutes you can start with a 75 minutes increase from the baseline what they normally used to do you can ask them to increase like 75 minutes a week and then gradually build it up to a 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous exercise divided into three to five sessions and always it's better to add a resistance that says at least two sessions per week because it helps to build muscle and endurance and it helps the patient to adhere to the aerobic exercise regime and how to ensure adaptation and long-term attendance you have to explain that to the patient what nfl is what are the risk factors the risk of cirrhosis lower transplant hcc and you have to tease them very reversible and benefits of exercise and always address any misconceptions teach them about energy balance teach them that the calorie you consume should be less than the calorie you burn so you should have achieve an 80 calorie balance to reduce weight and exercise should be tailored to patients individual patients physical fitness commodities and preferences and always encourage self-monitoring and always have such signpost to local access program weight loss program workers club because that helps your patient to be adherent to your exercise regime and this this chart summarizes uh how uh summarizes various techniques to ensure adherence to always take your patient into confidence set smart goals discuss the action plan with them when where and how they are going to do it and always ask them how confident you are that you will achieve the target and always identify barriers and you should have alternate plans to cope with the barriers and always ensure you you always ask the patient to self-monitor the progress and a success of any nice intervention is by the multi-disciplinary approach and all the stakeholders should play equal role in the management of your patients so and i come to the last slide thank you thank you charles for telling us that exercise is the single poly pill which can solve all the problem while you were speaking i was just wondering about the case that dr ashish had presented a shopkeeper who has to sit in his shop from nine o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening how are you going to convince him to exercise um so you you can start with interruptions in the sedentary behavior that's the first point to start with and that is important for us doctors also who sits throughout the day in our clinic so for the man who sits a shop ask him to get up every hour just keep a reminder yourself he can use either a wristband or a pyramid or an activity monitor and ask him to get up every hour that can be a good start asking to get up every hour take a few steps and in between you can start by short walks three minute walks every three or four hours short walks every two or three hours that would be a good point for him to take instead of asking him to walk out for 45 minutes or three or one hour in the gym who can run the shop when he is not there isn't it so uh you can always find you can always find time if you want if you if you can motivate him if you can teach him that tell him that it's a fatty liver is reversible with exercise you can if you can motivate him then there's always means and ways to find time okay doctor question i will be so thank you charles and uh i think uh you emphasize the fact that it is a multi-disciplinary approach of uh making the patient lose weight especially with the fatty liver so we have dr anjali huda who's the leading practitioner of metabolic medicine in new delhi will be talking to us about her tricks of how she is able to make these patients adhere to their lifestyle management dr hudaptis hi good evening everyone um thank you for this opportunity to all the esteemed colleagues and seniors and all the viewers who are watching i hope you will be able to take something home today so i have been practicing obesity medicine for quite a few years now and a lot of practic practically i get a lot of such cases and um i'm going to take control of this slide okay so we know the prevalence i don't need to tell you this this is something the data is it's in the public domain so a lot of prevalence of nafld everybody is already stressed upon this um so my question is uh there's a lot of misconception even amongst the medical community about the proteins intake in uh patients of uh nafld and uh most importantly if you uh see this question uh it is a very it is kind of confusing but i would love a poll on this to see how much everybody already knows about how much protein to have [Music] uh people are yet pulling in okay so i can continue um i guess i think i should continue because i don't want to take too much time well um so this is the just a question that arises all the time and i get a lot of patients who come to me and say that uh if you give me so much protein now my kidneys are going to fail now that is a that is a biggest challenge that i face uh we all know that in medical school and in my internal medicine md we were not being taught about how i mean we thought about how much protein but in actually practicing that medicine outside of your uh you know academic setup is different because the patients have questions and the biggest question comes from the fact that please don't give us so much protein or uh this doctor is telling me not to have so much protein that person is telling me to have not so much protein so this is a very very big question dr ashish had shared this amazing presentation about the protein and the low carb and i think uh that was that was great and dr eileen had told talked about do not restrict fat um but we have to restrict the fat and carb combos so um if the pole is ready can i move on wow that's great i'm so glad that everybody is answering this question uh it's it's perfectly answered already and the problem is that a lot of patients come come to us about saying that medical professionals are telling us not to have um so i can go to my next slide all right so i have a case presentation very typical i i practice in an urban setting so my patients generally belong to the urban area of south delhi so this is a patient a 60 year old male presenting a bad birth digestion pain in stomach bloating disturb sleep constipation now this is a very common scenario that's why i picked up the case because this is common most of the people who will come back they'll have constipation disturb see bloating this is um what i see almost at least daily uh patient's not been feeling well since the trip from europe he's had diabetes which is uncontrolled he's changing doctors and this is also very typical scenario where patient will go from one doctor to the other and um he's trying to control his diabetes through medication and diet but he goes off and on the wagon and he's kind of fond of drinking um owns a restaurant so makes things very difficult difficult for him to uh resist the kind of food that is given there and he uh keeps on trying you know trying new cuisines and he was started on acting insulin um uh before he had come to me and uh at the time the weight was 92.9 and you know you can see all the thing and there was a high waist-to-hip ratio which is visceral adiposity and um bp was well controlled but he's had diabetes for a while and um at the time when i saw the patient the hb a1c was seven and he had a elevate i will show you the labs going further he also uh detected ttg antibody which is for gluten tissue transglutaminase was detected in his blood work and he had bring brought all this blood work to me and here the the medicines you can see on the screen he's on some of the medications prescribed by an esteemed gastroenterologist and he was diagnosed to have sibo and nafld already when he was here okay i can go to the next slide all right this is a scan i've hidden all the identities so you can see this was done and next site please and this is a very i'm sorry for the picture quality um this is what the patient had presented uh to us with and um you can see the i will show you the labs further but this is how you can see the lfts are elevated okay and i'm gonna go to the next one so this was a prescription given by the gastroenterologist which the patient had shared with me and i put a screenshot of that okay all right so this is the breath test placebo that was done and patient is clearly having sibo which is bacterial overgrowth of small intestine okay i'm not able to move to the next slide all right so this is the lipid profile which was brought so you can see the elevated triglycerides the low hdl you can see the ldl is high and um patient is obviously diabetic so we need to bring that down so next slide all right this is an image i took and the reason why i was pointing out at the animal protein is because a lot of people are doing keto like dr eileen said and too much animal protein is being consumed and it is really not good for us and a lot of patients also need to be on omega 3 mufas as has already been explained to you by other doctors and a patient here is diabetic and this is a slide on insulin resistance but here we have clear diabetes and clear dysbiosis of the gut because patient has sibo and so patient needs to be managed accordingly and sibo is a very common scenario so this is what we did um so we did a hypo caloric diet now first important thing is to always take patients recall of the diet that he's having so very important to know what they are eating like dr ashi should explain how the patient is eating so we go by that very skeleton we don't go by something we think is right so we go by the choices the patient will make you know a lot of places i see a handout is given for a diet that is not the way to do it i have learned to actually tailor make it for the patients because they are um they are the ones who have to adhere to their diet so it's it's something that you you can give a lecture to them but being a part of their lifestyle is very important you have to understand so we've given uh lean proteins reduced animal protein this patient was eating chicken every day mutton almost three times a week you know we uh gas the glycemic index was explained already so low veg gi vegetables low gi fruits are given fruit is very overrated some in our this pop nafld population people are having big big plates of fruits which is really not recommended and um this patient was put on gluten-free grains uh because he uh detected uh ttg antibody and then um we reduced the fructose and lactose we only allowed the dairy products which were cultured so like lusty and charge and all that um fiber was given in form of psyllium husk and also a lot of vegetables so he was asked to reverse the ratio of macros in the meal from a two rotator subsidy to one roti and two subjects something you know something just reversing the ratio is good enough for the patients because they must eat one roti um in their lunch that is very common people will not um go on low carb like that they will just push for roti and you know some kind of snacking that that we have to provide replacements for so if the patient is having certain kind of a cookie you please replace it with a healthier one and for that you have to know the market you you should have been a shopper yourself and um a lot of the patients will um find it difficult to find so you have to also give pictures so what i do is i give pictures i mean my i have a team they provide the pictures and the location where the product is sold um and the patient can easily go so one day we get the patient to do all the shopping so shopping list is provided majority of cases but some people are okay with not being given a shopping list so very important and also consider the nature of job so just like doctor panicle has mentioned um you know there's a person and uh you know who's sitting at a shop now if that person can't work out we have to understand that we can make the compensatory workout at least on the sunday or a saturday wherever he is taking an off so um also we have to address the cheat meals the patients will cheat patients will not refrain from cheating so what you're giving in the diet you have to make a buffer for it so let's say you may prepared a diet like a dash diet or a mediterranean diet for the patient and you made a buffer uh you must make a buffer because if you're giving 1500 calories uh to a patient make sure that you you should know that the patient is going to go over 2000 for sure because there will be social gatherings there will be alcohol there will be festivals some celebration and food is a part of in our culture for celebration so we have to make the patient understand so then very close follow-ups are important so i think if the pa if if my friends my physician friends who are struggling with you know not having adherence to the diet of the patient what you must do is you must please dedicate some kind of a coach to the patient or some kind of a follow-up system because patient falls up the graph very soon you know they become demotivated the day they come to the clinic and the day they walk out uh and they the day they come back after two weeks three weeks they have some people don't make any changes in their life so you have to keep sending reminders maybe you can use a text service or a whatsapp service something that will keep the patient engaged at all times like for now like everybody's listening to this if i don't engage you you're gonna get bored and you will not have any space in your head to listen to what i'm saying so it's very important to uh engage the patient in constant activities and motivational messages recipes some kind of next site please this is a sample diet plan that has been given to this patient now you would wonder that this is very uh it looks very western but the patient is an urban indian uh in this setting so this this may look like a little western but a patient also is getting roti a patient is on gluten free roti patient is i have decreased the carbohydrate so as dr eileen mentioned do not take the carbohydrate out we have to decrease it and put the complex carbohydrate in place of the simple carbohydrate so to understand complex carbohydrates everything that has fiber is a complex carbohydrate like a vegetable or oats or a quinoa or a brown rice or a wild rice or a red rice or whole wheat grains they're all complex carbs so you need to give patient complex carbs a not simple carbs so let them decide what complex carb they like some people will not like coats some people will not like quinoa some people are not even familiar with the quinoa so you have to understand we can use lentils but too much lentil also will not help the nafld patients so we have to understand do not too much fruit not too much lentil just a balance of food is very important and having a good nutritionist on board is really really helpful because they can help you form the plan so this is uh something you know you guys can take a hint from um next slide please all right so supplemental advice i just wanted to add this because a lot of the patients um are um you know they have dysbiosis of gut so i use probiotics and i use pro and prebiotic food separately which is charged kombucha or you know some kind of fermented dishes um then magnesium citrate uh is very good for people people with um constipation this is because this this population is constipated because they're not already having too much fiber so celium husk is safe as fiber that i use um we can because patients who don't eat vegetables you will be surprised to know that indian patient thinks aloo and paneer is vegetable so we have to do the um psyllium husk supplementation for a few days so that patient is there's a bridging of gaps so the patient understands that we have to eat fiber and can't be honest oral supplement through other life so slowly as they go up on their fiber you can give support with psyllium husk and then take it down curcumin for inflammation obesity the patient is obese and curcumin is um is an anti-inflammatory omega-3 fish oil great for his hdl and also again an anti-inflammatory next slide please at the end of three months patient feels much better so i'm kind of showing off that we we had this uh result a patient is off insulin he's uh you know the hbmc now at the last week was 5.8 we don't have his recent fibro scan but lfts were done i'll show you the trend next slide this is the weight how the patient has lost from november to feb uh he's lost almost 9 kgs next slide and this is a trend of lipid and liver profile and i want you to see that how the patient uh profile has changed how the lfps have changed and also you will see the triglycerides are back up again in uh in the month of july so um now if the triglycerides are back up again the patient is obviously started to non-adhere because patient is now not in follow-up so if there is a three-month follow-up done patient has is now due to come back so reminders have been sent for him to come back and the patient uh this this follow-up is very important you need to keep sending reminders especially uh when you know that patient has a tendency to fall off the graph constantly so um next type please uh this is his sonogram of the abdomen you can see that the fatty liver has gone to grade one uh next slide please so what was my challenges in management which i think all the physicians face is non-adherence to the diet for which i have told you you must have a great follow-up you must have reminders motivational messages some kind of a engagement with the patient alcohol consumption is very common in a lot of especially in urban delhi so alcohol consumption you have to tell the patient to um you know basically have a little ration for it not have too much of alcohol they will not stop but you can always give them the option of not mixing sugary drinks with their alcohol and stuff like that social life distractions biggest problem because lot of there are a lot of festivals in our country and you have to let them be you have to make sure that the patient has cheated patient has done all this you have when you bring them back you please tell them how to do a little bit of a compensation which is like a cheat pill uh cheat sheet you can give them i can provide all this to you if you uh if someone wants to message me separately so you need to provide the patient the little bit of a compensatory method if they have cheated and if they have gone off the wagon because they will need that they need to start managing so you need to also educate the patient education is very important uh constant demotivation is there because um obviously diabetic male and obviously stressed and um diabetic patients are depressed it has been seen so a constant demotivation keeps happening next slide these are the references for everyone and you can take a screenshot and i think i'm done thank you dr anjali i think your second last slide was the most important one where you were talking about all the tricks uh so i did not disturb you otherwise i was uh hoping to interrupt you in between yes you should actually so let's move on dr chavla can you take over from here dr javla are you there i'm there partial just wanted to know from dr anjali how many patients of us adhere to her diet and how many are failures maybe at the time of discussion but it would be a pleasure for me to introduce professor arun sanyan whom i have known for almost 30 35 years or even more we were together at all india institute he moved to u.s and now he is the man of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease well known throughout the world he's working at the virginia commonwealth university and he has done a lot of work on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease he's going to talk to us on a very different aspect today we always knew of sleep apnea syndrome in association with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease circadian clocks to nafld role of sleep in nafld arun please okay uh so yeah thank you yogesh uh can you all hear me yes yes okay so you've already given away my question very quickly so if anybody gets the question answer wrong that's really bad since dr chavula has already given the answer so anyways if so here is the uh profile 45 year old lady who works as a nurse in a busy hospital presents with fatigue and intermittent heaviness in the right upper quadrant uh she stopped having periods about a year ago and since then also has been feeling more tired and fatigued uh she saw her primary care physician who noted that her liver enzymes were mildly elevated but reassured her that it's not very important these changes are routinely seen don't mean anything but somehow she was not reassured she works as a nurse and she talked to some other doctors who said why don't you go see a gastroenterologist so she has a history of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy three years ago she was told to be pre-diabetic in the past she has two children last child was 15 years ago and she did have toxemia during her pregnancy requiring c-section on examination she's blood pressure is as you see it weight is 75 kilos uh normal heart and lung exam and then anterior liver spends about seven centimeter you have the labs over here i'll give you a minute for all of you to look at it and you can see the liver enzymes are marginally elevated uh nothing dramatic in any of these labs per se so which of the following elements are particularly relevant in this history uh that have not been specifically addressed in what i have shown you and that was sort of originally missed by whoever took the history uh symptoms of depression history of retained stones pancreatitis symptoms of depression weight change change in bowel habits these are all things that were not in the history that should have been asked symptoms of depression weight change abuse of prescription narcotics and then symptoms of weight change depression and sleep pattern [Music] uh i guess people are still polling sir yeah let's keep moving uh what happened did i lose my screen so you can share again case study okay so the correct answer of course is the last one because as yogesh said we're talking about sleep so let me just put this in little perspective for you so originally when this earth that we all call home was created as you know we are exposed to the sun half the day and half the day we have no sun and that's called the night so our 24 hour cycle is divided into a period where we have exposure to sunlight and period where we do not have sunlight why is this important this is important because when life evolved this solar energy was incredibly important for the initiation of life on this planet and if you remember your original bacteria and algae that developed primarily relied on photosynthesis to generate energy so photosynthesis by definition requires sunlight right now evolution required because these machines were these original primordial cells were not very efficient so in order to maintain efficiency you did not want your metabolic machinery turned on all day long your transcriptional machinery for all these photosynthetic enzymes turned on all day long when the sun was only available for half the day so there evolved mechanisms to regulate your metabolic machinery so that it would only turn on when the light was on and so this led to what are known as clock genes and these clock genes are preserved all the way from the most primordial bacteria all the way to human beings so energy homeostasis of course is essential for life because no energy no life right so you have to make atp and that's why we're talking about nutrition nutrition is how we get our energy so as we have evolved as a species and through all the animal species a central regulator of many biological processes that require energy essentially are regulated by these clock genes and these clock genes have various inputs which involve light which is processed through the pineal body goes to the supracortical nucleus uh it goes through other signals that are related to food intake that is linked to when we are awake uh and so there are external inputs and there are internal molecular circuits that feed back onto these clock genes these clock genes output of course are like master regulators of many metabolic pathways and through modification of these metabolic pathways they can modify inflammation fibrosis oncogenesis so the clock genes are central regulators of normal physiology and if you look at the circadian regulation there is not only a central clock which is in the hypothalamic circuit and linked to the supracortical nucleus but there is also a clock in every organ starting from your intestine to your liver to every organ in the body because the clock then regulates when things turn on and when things turn off and we have historically considered all of the biology of these different organs in a very monomorphic way that when things come on they stay on and we say okay if you give high fat then this happens or that happens but the point is in an individual person these things change from day and night and all of these so as you can see over here there are transcriptional activators that are get occupied during the day and there are others that get occupied at night and these of course can be epigenetically modified as well so the master clock which is determined by uh and its functionality which is determined by rest and activity cycles the availability of food and how long you are fasting and this relates to your conversation about the intermittent fasting and the 15 hour fasting and also to temperature cycles our body temperature you know fluctuates through the course of the day these then feed from the central to the liver clock which then modulates all of the different functions that are shown over here which of course many of these you can clearly link the dots to the development of steatosis inflammation and fibrosis there are several different types of uh clinical disorders that can impact uh how the clock genes work first of all sleep deprivation we know now thanks to uh uh our very connected world with constant uh 24 7 television 24 7 uh twitter you know messaging that people are in general compared to 30 years ago at least there's literature in the west people in general are sleeping one to one and a half hour less per day than they were 25 years ago and this is of course linked to our social behavior uh with all of the social media services so when you get sleep deprived as you can see over here it alters through modification of these clock genes a number of hormones that are critically involved in your food intake behavior such as leptin ghrelin etc net result being you essentially increase your appetite and you eat more and it resets your central barrel set because the body has a way to modulate and regulate your barostat which over time by the way keeps going up which is why with every passing decade you put on a few more pumps than when you were 25 years old and it's harder to get off it because the why is it harder to get off because it also regulates thermoregulation and your energy expenditure and of course sleep is critically linked to the hypothalamic access and your cortisol and sympathetic activity and both as you know probably most familiar with are directly linked to insulin resistance and glucose tolerance so there are multiple mechanisms by which you know if a person is not sleeping so particularly for shift workers and particularly for women who work the whole night come back they have to still expect it to get their children off to school they have to get their husband or spouse off to school maybe even make food and make sure there's food for the in-laws then get a little bit of sleep then get up and make sure there is laundry and marketing whatever needs to be done get everybody ready for the evening meal before they have to head back to work to do the night shift so particularly for those people it's very challenging and one of the common things you know as a general rule in managing lifestyle whether it's obesity in the context of obesity or nash or whatever it is is you have to really understand the individual patient and their life because it is only in the context of their life that you can start making small changes that actually can be implemented not only in the short term but also in the long term because nobody is going to change their life 180 degrees and have because it will have an impact on their family it'll have an impact on all other things and with all the other constraints in society and social responsibility etc many people are unable to engage so asking about sleep is in so we've historically always felt insulin resistance is food exercise but it's really a three-legged stool and the third leg is sleep so the other possible way sleep can affect uh our patient is sleep apnea and because we know when you get sleep ethnic you get intermittent hypoxia and your sleep gets fragmented there's a huge body of literature connecting sleep apnea to oxidative stress inflammation and sympathetic activation and i know that it's not just in the west even in india uh snoring and sleep apnea is extremely common if you've ever taken the rajdhani express from delhi to bombay or calcutta you will know that half the compartment is snoring and so there's a exceptional amount of sleep apnea that is present in these patients and often not really interrogated and so uh you know of course sleep apnea due to all of these mechanisms directly again affects metabolism glyc glucose metabolism uh fat metabolism denova lipogenesis and oxidative stress and inflammation which then can contribute to worsening and in fact uh there's at least some studies suggesting that people who have significant sleep apnea have more severe disease remember that nash is primarily a centrilobular zone three disease so when it is a central that is the zone the liver is a hypoxic organ the liver gets 70 percent of its blood from the portal vein 30 from the hepatic artery so compared to other organs it is it is getting blood that has already been deoxygenated in the intestine before it gets to the liver so starting with a relatively low oxygen state the centrilobular the by the time the blood goes through the sinusoid and gets to the central vein it that region is particularly susceptible to hypoxia so sleep apnea can accelerate and worsen the injury that is produced by the metabolic stress if in that region and and there's some data that as i'm showing you over here that when you put people on cpap you actually start seeing improvement in some of the parameters of liver injury in this population so there are some clinical perks that sleep impacts metabolic health in three ways decreased total amount of sleep and disruption of the day night cycle disrupted sleep patterns so even if you sleep if you're not getting enough rem sleep because you consumed alcohol you can you taking some drugs uh you are stressed out whatever else is impacting your sleep pattern and your rem cycles it is extremely important because the rent cycles are linked to how your clock genes work and in fact one of the first things that gets disrupted metabolically when you start becoming obese and it doesn't matter whether you take a high sugar or high fat it doesn't matter why you become indict-induced obesity the clock genes are the very first set of genes that become abnormal and last year for sleep apnea now this of course is very useful because you can actually intervene for all of these and this this will increase is none of these is a single tool that will fix every problem but this increases the efficacy of your other lifestyle interventions that you put in so a nash evaluation is incomplete that's the this is a take home message a nash evaluation is incomplete without the following questions when do you go to bed how many hours of sleep do you get do you feel rested when you wake up so that should be a clue because if you wake up tired that is a very good uh history taking question that you are having disordered sleep and do you snore or do your family members complain about your snoring or if the spouse is there ask the spouse if the person snores and last but not the least i have to put it out there because i didn't hear it from anybody else is when you're doing lifestyle intervention you have to talk to the family you have to engage the whole family telling one person in the family to change and be start eating a very different kind of diet with the rest of the family is eating parathas and basically you know is and that's what they like to eat you got to understand that's comfort food for them so it is not going to work unless the whole family understands and engages and you in and if the likelihood of having fatty liver disease in family members who are following the same lifestyle is extremely high much higher than the general society so it is very important when you get a patient to also ask about what's going on with the family and whenever possible uh try to engage in lifestyle intervention as something the whole family engages in a more healthy way of living rather than treatment of a disease per se so i'm going to stop there thank you arun for giving us a totally different perspective about non-alcoholic fatty liver disease uh we have got it's six o'clock and till what time do you want us to continue we have about 15 questions coming from the audience hello my suggestion is that we take the questions first we have the discussion and thereafter if there is time then i'll have about three to four slides to show but that can pass over i think today's discussion would be most important science fine and also i would like to remind the audience that we have done a kind of a half-hearted job on very important topics like diet and exercise because there's a lot to be covered we have just about scratched the surface and for instance we haven't talked about intermittent fasting at all which is a very important new concept and there would be different issues of exercise which are coming up as to what to do in by way of exercise during lockdown and so on and so forth but that would be probably another uh area for a more detailed discussion but at the moment i think that we can take the questions that people are waiting for yeah ac you have the questions with you otherwise i'll start with a couple of them question is from dr sanjeev khanna he has asked that many diabetics like to eat four to five fruits daily as a part of their healthy diet uh is this okay can i answer that yes okay this is a like i talked about in my uh talk also eating too much fruit has become uh is they think it's healthy and you have to understand the food can the fruits contain fructose so if you're not concentrating on the low glycemic index which is very difficult for us to explain to the patient all the time so we should just minimize the fruits to maybe a cup of fruit or two cups of fruit a day because cup is like literally a cup you know we are not a plate of fruit so we have to tell them about the portion sizes which is very important a cup of fruit like i always tell them they're like get the cup of fruit in a plane that is the amount of fruit you eat at one time so most of the patients will understand okay what is a cup of fruit otherwise there's too much fructose i might also add you know that there are types of fruits which have a lot of fructose and they're very juicy for example you know pineapples mangoes and lychees on the other or for that matter even your [Music] melons on the other hand you have some which are much richer in fiber for example pears and apples so i usually tend to also specify or give them a choice as to which would be the fruits that they could choose from any any comments on that like i love mangoes and i can tell you from my practice in lucknow that during the summer season most of my patients put on three to four kilos just binging on mangoes what's your reaction to that do you get mangoes in haryana yeah yeah yes sir we do get a lot of mangoes in not the north ncr region the thing is that patients will eat mango we cannot stop them so we have to tell them to eat to portion it so i will tell the patient to have a slice a slice of mango or maybe have a one full mango and then compensate on the fact that they should not be eating rice or chapati in that meal alien what do you do when your alphonsos are out you're muted mute yourself please the portion control is the way to go because we cannot completely stop them from eating uh you know a lot of things so we need to tell them how to portion and when to have it that exact the right time to have it yeah i think the question stems from the fact that you know when the who revised their food pyramid guidelines in the last one they included five portions of fruits and they did yeah yeah that's the food pyramid i'm sure all of you have seen that yeah the problem is that they did not specify what types of fruits and most of the tropical fruits usually many of them they're actually loaded with a lot of fructose and that's the reason why obviously you can't ban them but the fact of the matter is that yes i think proportioning them is probably very important if they can but if they like to binge on fruits then you know there are others which are good i would add here that fruit juices are worse [Music] you know people who like alcohol as cocktails so if they have it with fruit juice you know the fructose with alcohol actually doubles or more than doubles the injury to the liver so actually it's better to have a scorched meat rather than to actually have a fruit juice cocktail yeah please please related to this uh one is uh both to uh anjali and eileen when you arrange for a dietary counselling do you get the cook and the mother-in-law also yes yes i actually sorry doctor allen you can answer first no definitely uh it is a family counselling because uh it's not a single person that will be exactly responsible and there's a lot of it's not one session of counselling that you know it everything happens in it so what we do is we go one by one so sometimes we just take one thing at a time maybe sometimes we just take the portion control sometimes we take just the type of food and sometimes we take only one particular meal so it all depends upon what is uh you know culturally possible for the you know patient to do okay and then dr sanyal talked about comfort food if you're taking comforts away from the patient uh it causes discomfort and depression and how do you deal with that yeah so dark chocolate yeah dark chocolate dark chocolate so actually comfort food is a very relative uh subjective term for somebody dal travel is also comfort food so uh and dark chocolate may not be their comfort food so everybody's comfort food is different and uh there are people who bargain with you like you know i i they say like i love pani puri at least give me to have it once in a week so for them that is their comfort food so we got to uh you know gauge and understand what they actually need and what makes them uh you know really feel better sometimes uh when they died for a long period of time they have this something called a diet fatigue like they literally are fed up and irritated with it and they just want to leave it and you know so that's when we give them a kind of a break where we tell them that this is how you can substitute one for the other so comfort food is included in their diet and we tell them how to adjust with the comfort food maybe the quantity or can i add something yeah so i just want to add a couple of things that is really important for long-term success to approach this as living healthy rather than prescription for a disease because right up front if you give the patient a sense or perception because you know perception is reality for them so if you give them the perception that this is something i am taking for a disease i need to just take it for a certain period of time and then i'm off the hook and i'm back to doing whatever i always want to do uh it is but the work people you will find the biggest success are the ones who say you know what i can have a fantastic life and really enjoy living in a different way this is like i'm adopting this to feel better about myself be healthy and it's more holistic and sounds a little you know uh almost buddhistic but it's actually true that the and i'm sure i'm hoping that uh dr kandey and ruda will agree with me that their biggest successes are when the person thinks this is fantastic i'm living my life in a whole different they adopt it as something they've invested in as a positive it's a positive construct and not absence of a negative thing would you agree yeah totally agree totally agree uh one more thing is there whenever we have lectures or webinars in which case series are presented or a case is discussed you find six months later all the tests have become normal and the patients have improved but most of us who are in practice for a long period of time we know that all these patients will come back with the same problem again it's these improvements that we are shown in webinars are not really lasting improvements the patients switch back to their old habits very quickly and how do you deal with that may i may i add to that anil also you know there is a particular bias in uh presenting cases we usually always present our success stories because you know nobody would be foolish enough to actually present a failure story but actually i was thinking of doing a seminar once and only disclosure sucking failure so gold may i can i uh so i think it's really important initially and this is something that we as hepatologists are not really trained to do so at least at our place part of the team is a psychologist we have actually a behavioral person we started including them about 15 years ago and it's incredibly helpful because they find out things for example if somebody is growing up in a family and they are getting yelled at by whatever or their father beats them or something they learn to eat as a way to cope with their inner anxiety or stress or they're getting bullied in school and it happens in india i can tell you firsthand that if you're a skinny bengali boy growing up in delhi you get beat up on a regular basis on the playground even the girls would beat me up and steal my lunch so so you know you then develop habits to cope with all of this that only now at the age of 60 i can look back and say yes this is how it happened but people don't even realize that these are coping mechanisms and the way this is all surface is now there's huge amount of data that after bariatric surgery the suicide rates are up that's because you know if you don't if you don't understand the background of why people eat the way they do and you just clip their stomach you you create a whole new set of problems so i think really taking that time to understand the barriers and why they adopt the lifestyle they do is critically important there's a lot of problem with addiction behavior yeah so food addiction is just like alcohol addiction the neuro circuitry is completely worked out i can give a talk at another time on that but it's the same set of triggers and once the addiction circuitry is turned on you know it's turned on we know when you stop smoking you gain weight why is that because the addiction circuitry demands to be fed so if you stop one thing it wants something else to keep that circuit going because it's a hedonistic thing that people want so i think those are really critically important things for long-term success yet as a medical community we've done very little we give it one second we say lifestyle very important but nobody follows it let's find a pill so i think that's where the field needs to go if we're really going to solve diabetes cardiovascular disease cancer and nash all at the same time that's the direction we have to fix when we take a poll from all the people who are yet logged in i believe it's about 1100. how many of them want a more detailed discussion in a separate webinar on this issue of eating eating behavior fooding and lifestyle because you know today we have only scratched the surface so i think arun made some very important points or whatever and depending on that we'll just decide on our future webinar sorry for that can i quickly add something uh what i do since i learned that in the u.s i do a phq-9 for every patient and this is really a quick uh way to see um their depression uh screening you know so so that you can have that patient you know set out to be uh referred to a psychiatrist or a psychologist depending on their phq 9 it's kind of been very helpful for me if somebody else would like to do that sciences is still relatively underdeveloped in india you know considering the size of the country and the stresses that people are under on a day-to-day basis just to survive compared to other specialties in the medical field i think the behavioral sciences in india and there's still a lot of social stigma to seeing a behavioral person that needs to be tackled it's a complex issue no another issue i'm happy that you brought it up around is economics you see if it's a very well to do person in south delhi he wouldn't mind spending a lot of time with madame huda because you know it's a very fanciful thing obviously you talk about whether to have avocados or to have grapes in the kind of practice which i have in lucknow for instance they're poor people a referral to a dietitian means another 900 rupees gone and another visit to a psychiatrist or a counselor means another 900 rupees gone and you know he says that look i came to you for a digestive problem so whether you like it or not if you are practicing in the kind of india that we are familiar with which we call badass the physician has to be able to deliver on multiple fronts it just can't be that you know you sub-specialize with each person doing a role it's very good for learning and it's very good for evolution of the science but ultimately the delivery route is a single window policy in many times can i i hope my indian friends would agree yes so there are certain things which a patient cannot change for example the shift work sure you'll be doing shift work he'll have to lose his job to change the shift work exactly similarly the patient which dr ashish kumar presented if he is working nine to nine in a shop sitting in a shop and he has no help available to run the shop he's the only person sitting in the shop he'll have to close the shop to go for a walk he loses revenue from there so that is not an option he will consider with any degree of logic yeah yeah but you know the exam the example that i give these people that if you look at all the american presidents including the present one trump who spends an awful amount of time playing golf but you know he could be criticized but even his predecessors like barack obama or bill clinton they spent two hours or so jogging or doing looking after their bodies you know and i keep telling them if the american president can spare that amount of time because it's his priority then i think if you think it's your priority you'll find time maybe at least 40 minutes sometimes that helps to reset priorities uh take decisions while on treadmill but the shop people cannot do that the the other option is of course to innovate you know that every hour they can do some stretching while they're still sitting in their shop or in between customers you know you can do chair sit-ups where you grab the handle of your chair like this you know like i'm doing uh there are a lot of little things that you can do but more very important if the person has to find it enjoyable so start with something that the person actually enjoys doing takes pride in doing then you'll show off to his kids he'll show up to his co-workers he'll get them doing it with him then you're more likely to see sustained benefit but if something is perceived as punishment somehow then you know the first time they can dodge it they'll find a reason to dodge it is the issue about red meat he says the red meat with animal fat generates more trans fats what are your comments on this i you know i think you have to have balance in life so what i find is something that resonates well both in western patients plus i have a big indian community here in where i live and i see a lot of people is to ask them to follow the middle path you know somehow it resonates when i say follow the middle path it's sort of you know somehow culturally in other ways it resonates with people if i tell them you know high fat low fat this they start looking at me like i've come from mars that they don't know but for the average person trying to translate all this high-fat low-fat keto mediterranean they're like i have no clue doctor while you're speaking in a completely language that i have no i cannot translate this into anything i can actually do in my life so i tell them listen we have common sense you know this is something we have lost in the modern world you know watch how much you eat avoid second helpings don't overload the plate on the first helping avoid late night snacking and particularly identify the refined foods high in refined sugars low in fibers those are really probably not good for you you know try and get enough sleep follow the middle path middle plat is a great way to live your life and so so i think trying there's simple tools once and and one thing is no one single tool works for everybody you have to really get to know your patient dr sheikh nazir has two questions one is that does omega 3 have any role in nafld and second is does yoga have a role in nfd so i think it's just the first one with the omega-3s you know uh unfortunately all of the long-term omega-3 clinical trials sort of failed particularly where there was histology involved so it again shows you can't solve nash is a complex disease and you can't solve a complex disease you know with a simple dietary manipulation that oh if i just ate a few more walnuts or drowned myself in olive oil i would be fixed for life you know if you take 5000 calories in olive oil when you're burning only 1500 calories per day you still have a problem metabolic problem so you have to put it in context yoga i will differ you know to gore and others who may have some insights into this because i have no data-driven answers to that question um i if i might come in i was looking at what are the things which we have left completely uncovered this time so one of the issues was of course diet where we talked about uh you know intermittent fasting different types and of the exercise varieties one was yoga and i was mentioning to arun and others that i had last reviewed that topic a few years back and there were about 40 articles on yoga interestingly most of the articles had shown that there was benefit about 80 percent of them the problem is that with scientists you go into hair splitting and therefore you say that although all of them did show benefit not all ninety percent short benefit they use different approaches so some use this yoga some use that yoga some use that yoga but the fact of the matter is that you know we often are good at hair splitting defecting because that's what we learned from our first year dissection in anatomy but we are not very good at synthesizing so that's a topic that requires a full review i think we have been working on it caution i thought you were supposed to do that but because of lack of time this time we haven't done it but i think that's a very important topic which kosher i and arun are planning to actually review extensively i'll just add that arun sanyal almost 10 to 15 years ago wanted to do a project on yoga and nephilim arun am i right absolutely absolutely we never could get enough interest in funding yeah but we could never get enough funding to support a proper study with appropriate metabolic measures you know and other things and were unable to get get it off the ground maybe one day we'll still be able to come back to it and do it what is your opinion about healthy snacks is it a oxymoron or there are something known as healthy snacks you are addressing it to ellen are you you know there are a lot of patients when they come to me and they i explain to them the diet the the last question that they want to ask me is what do i do if i am hungry in between so i i asked them back i said where is the time to be hungry in between because you've had your breakfast probably you've had something in the mid morning then you've had your lunch then you've had a mid-afternoon snack then you've had a mid afternoon mid evening uh some snack and then you want to have a netflix uh snack as well so more than actually physiological hunger it is the hunger that uh you know you have in your mind that you are hungry so you uh what is explained to them is to understand the actual difference between a physiological hunger and uh you know actually feeling hungry just uh with your thinking and if they have to eat snacks uh what i advise them is uh you know drink your snacks that would be better in terms of non uh sugary drinks uh so you can have chaas and you can have the other things so there are a lot of things that can be had as snacks but when you say drink and the other things so i mean that has left a lot of doubts in our mind so when we talk about yeah i'll tell you one thing so there are a few things which are considered snacks all right uh in the indian perspective it is the the fafra churras and uh you know all those things which are considered snacks but from the diet point of view we we talk about uh chars we talk about uh lime water we talk about uh uh fruit your the fruit that you eat we talk about your nuts we talk about uh the other uh you know curds and yogurt which is given as snacks so those have to be explained to the patient that these are the things that you got to think in terms of snacks and not the fat and oil combinations which most of our indian snacks if you just in every culture you just try to think what is the snacks that they usually eat and it is a combination of only these two macros one is carb and the other one is fat so most of our snacks which is a carb fat combination those snacks are the most dangerous snacks which have to be avoided so this is what uh we need to explain in detail to uh the patients i remember once dr gord chaudhary and i were discussing and we talked about this that patient spends only about 10-15 minutes with you but he spends the rest of the 24 hours with his family with his friends with his mother-in-law and wife and neighbors so what you say to have that impact once and say three months or once in two months is uh do do you think it is a logical thing that it will have that impact that you want yes it does so when we uh when we actually uh ask them to maintain a food diary and write down everything that we eat when we look back we are able to actually find out what are the things that are actually unnecessary that have been eaten throughout the day so besides a main meal they may be eating a wholesome meal but the foods that they eaten in between are the actual culprits of their disease condition actually patients who are able to keep diary of their food i'm sure they will improve definitely see nowadays uh there are a lot of apps also which patients are using because they they are getting conscious as to what they are eating they are counting their calories and they are actually finding out what are the protein foods that they can eat rather than the carb foods that they can eat so these things are it is happening but it is a conscious effort that is on both the sides it's uh the dietitian as well as the patient side because both need to work in uh and as uh dr anjali rightly said engagement with the patient is the most important aspect here so if the patient comes to me just on the first visit and he has had the diet like uh the way uh dr kumar had uh this thing it is very difficult to actually change their diet overnight so it takes a long period of time by the time you hand hold and counsel these kind of patients dr ashwini chopra has asked few questions and one question is about gain nfld patients is it all right to have key so ghee when we talk about ghee is it ghee is uh a part of the saturated fat group so the total amount of fat that is consumed in the diet is very important and we say it should be less than 30 percent of the total calorie consumption 10 out of which can be given from saturated fats so in the in saturated fats you got to choose whether 10 of that whether you want to have a cheese you want to have butter or you want to have ghee you can't have all the three so some people for them having the ghee tadka in the dal is the only way to eat dal so that's when we tell them how to uh actually choose the right fat based on what they like and what is right for them then there is a question about somebody has recommended that soya is a good source of protein for the patients and the question is soya is controversial because of its hormonal effects and some connections to breast cancer it is often prescribed by the dietitian what is the panel's opinion i think soya is it can only be safe it's if it's not processed because the isoflavones are beneficial to the body but the kind of soil we get in india uh is in former soya chap i don't know if you've heard of it um and the kind of soil nuggets that we get they're a little more processed than the actual soil like that but um if you ask me soya is uh should be given in only moderation especially to the pure vegetarian patients who are you know they lack protein somewhere and what's about its relationship to breast cancer there is a relationship so so yeah so processed soy is directly related to the high incidence of breast cancer so it just on the estrogen receptors it it goes and affects there so uh soya should not be used especially processed so it should not be used in diet at all and you should discourage patients to have so they are charged specially uh dr sanyal i can't see there is one question for him but meanwhile i like to mention that there are 1215 people in the audience today and they hundred percent responses that they want more discussion on this topic dr gordas may kindly note yeah i think we need to now take the next webinar a level higher and much higher and we have to touch upon the issues that we have left uncovered i think we identified a few aspects of diet i think ashish issue really set the ball rolling i think we were a little too rigid with the time because that area had too much to be covered and i think we'll have to have you back we have to look at intermittent fasting so different types of eating habits see we today touched only about diets but we didn't talk about eating habits except about snacking in general okay i think that that's a very important issue the timing of food and so on and so forth and i think we have to look at different forms of exercise i think charles dealt with a few actually i have a few uh shall we say youtube links which i thought i'll share with you but i can do it next time and i think kosciel and i and arun have to work very hard on the yoga front to put up what is the actual data and how it works and there's no doubt that if you look at baba ramdev whether you like him or hate him he doesn't have fatty liver disease you can see by just looking at him and the fact of the matter is that he has popularized yoga even if you don't agree with the rest of his stuff so yoga does obviously have a place and especially in indian minds and we have to be able to remove the grains from the shaft and put it across another doctor yeah yeah a couple of things which i thought uh also need discussion next time is the roll of coffee roll of green tea and and these these particular aspects intermittent fasting certainly is very important and as snacks i think chanas are excellent no calories i if one can be a proponent of that as long as one can have yeah i'm surprised anjali didn't mention cucumber actually cucumber is often served as snacks you know even with drinks i think it's a very low calories right which is pretty good very arun any suggestions from you there's one question for dr sanyal uh how much sleep is recommended daily and what does one do if he cannot get that much sleep well i mean you know you're screwed let me ask you what are you doing neither god nor a magician i'm just getting doing with your lack of sleep so physiologically you need between six and eight hours of sleep you really should not drop below six you know and the reality is staying up to two o'clock watching the news or doing stupid nonsense on twitter or instagram and all this rubbish that actually uh has created a whole new problem of adult onset attention deficit disorder in our general population uh you know and uh is actually in my view this is an untested hypothesis that a lot of the increase in mental health issues that you're seeing in society are driven because we are not disconnecting the brain like everything else periodically needs to disconnect and re-sort of reset itself you know and which is why people have hair trigger tempers things set them off uh because there's a and these are all interrelated and interconnected problems i think my if somebody tells you that they are unable they physically there's some real limitation to them getting enough sleep it requires a more detailed conversation about why that is so and you know how much time are they spending doing email with their buddies or email is not considered my children tell me that's very old-fashioned that one does email that you know you have 10 other things on their cell phone that they are doing and i keep telling them that that's the reason that they are so stupid because they don't actually know anything because their entire body of knowledge is the gossip they hear uh on a daily basis so you know i'm ranting like an old man but that's what i am uh i just add one little thing that i um i tell all my patients to meditate i think it is something which patients find very non-doctoral but i made sure that everybody i gave one link of meditation so that because because of the high stress that is one thing that really helps in a lot of studies as you all must have always no no i give a link on youtube which is uh you know you it's a basically 20 minute thing that you listen before you sleep it's like a chakra balancing it's just concentration it's guided meditation basically guided is initiative so the other emerging field goal is mindfulness yeah and uh we're actually conducting a uh international trial us and denmark uh on a mindfulness on it's a more holistic approach to managing fatty liver disease without drugs but specifically focusing on the concept of mindfulness and it's 20 minutes per day you know and it's again a guided approach and you do a certain number of things with a coach and then you do do it by yourself then you regroup with your peer group and so there's a whole set of structure because you know you can't just tell somebody to be mindful and then ask them to come back three months later because nothing will change so so it's a process so you know i think there's this is a huge untapped area and the beauty of this area is that you can impact diabetes heart disease cancer so many things in general feeling of well-being and happiness because in the end you know good health is not the absence you know i in my old age i understand this because that used to be the w at your definition right that health is a positive construct it's not just the absence of disease and frequently we focus mainly on just making a person disease free but you can actually do better and i think all of these things we're talking about together will have to be combined with social messaging so that on the importance of uh living more healthy taking time for yourself you know shutting down periodically resetting your brain uh being more thoughtful being more mindful it'll actually make society better but it's not a simple process as you can imagine but what do you have discussion uh sir dr chavela sir dr madan you have any questions no i think uh there there was a question on the type of aerobic and resistance exercises gore has mentioned it could be done next time and for charles difference between moderate and vigorous what is the definition of these exercises uh do i have time to show one or two slides i'll make my presentation next time but just to give a kind of a appetizer if you are interested i can show that yeah sure sure is i'll just as an appetizer okay can i have the can i have the next third slide not the word yeah next next next first four three all right side step step out again here we go a little bit wider now a little bit wider than the first time so that i think many of you know that's a very standard walk with leslie [Music] next place yeah now there are other fitness links which i actually use when i nowadays write my prescription so i give them a link and i ask them to open the link in the opt before they have gone home so that if they have a problem and then i encourage them to do that next please come back to the center bring up that knee and curl come back down so the point that i was trying to make down if you want to this is another one you can either add weights to it or you can i have that playing please okay next please yeah so you can't ignore baba ramdev when it comes to yoga but there are quite a few links so basically what i do and anjali i'll take your opinion on that i ask the patient what is your mindset like if you know if it's one of those south delhi westernized type they would probably like one of those white-skinned guys doing a lovely exercise you know walk with leslie or something like that give them a link like that when it comes to my lucknow practice now they think that this is too potent so then you know i give them one of the yoga links which are i think equally effective so never mind the color never mind the format as long as it delivers results you know but i don't like it you are telling somebody no i was saying there are a few apps that you can share with patients because google play yeah yeah and i share it with the patient nowadays in my prescription i have the link mentioned there so that they have to just click on it and i also have a few diet links and that actually you know i'm doing a survey now to see that if i have advised it to 200 people how many have actually followed it and some of the stories are remarkable i mean people have lost 10 to 15 kgs and they have learned how to feel wonderful and healthy next please yeah i think that that's the feedback form i have to just remind you that whatever we do it's based on your feedback do spend half a minute to give us a feedback and it was a pleasure having you over from my side i have to thank the chairpersons and the speakers yogesh and anil and kaushal and over to you people to thank the speakers and then kaushal and then our organizing secretary dr rinkesh what java you can i think it was a wonderful exercise uh today gore as usual this has been a wonderful series uh as you said we learned a lot today on diet and exercise and effort but we still have a long way to go and maybe in the coming series of talks we would learn more so yeah i might as well announce you know i was planning to have the indian nafld as the next one but if suppose the demand for diet and exercise and lifestyle is overwhelming we could possibly have this continued over to the next one so we'll go by what the feedback is right and and extremely grateful to these speakers who took us through all these talks especially ashish dr ellen then dr anjali and arun sanyan so it was extremely wonderful listening to you all and we learnt a lot thank you very much arun for joining us very early in the morning but without you we cannot have a symposium or an effort over to god thank you i i thought the talks were fantastic all of the talks i really enjoyed it and i think many of our many common themes emerged so you know when you start distilling through all the different perspectives uh i think uh when you start hearing some common themes emerge then you know that those are things that you can actually bring into your practice and i think the points made by eileen by anjali by charles and then ashish beautiful exposition of all of the data uh you know unfortunately i missed everything before i because of the time gap we had a little bit of a screw-up so when i joined i missed the early part of the things but uh everything i know was really fantastic and we covered a lot of ground but as you noted you know there's a lot still to be done and i think this is the next frontier of nash research you know the drugs will come when they will come but this is really where i think there is and it's a level playing field right because nobody knows how to approach the complexity of all of these things so so i'm looking forward to the next session thank you i don't make sure you're there on time next time no we will bank on you yeah thank you everyone so uh we invite you on behalf of uh hope initiative and arsenal on for the next webinar on 13th of december uh 2020 and uh yes based on your feedback we'll decide whether the topic will be indian nafld is it unique or we want to continue uh more discussion on the lifestyle interventions so with that i'll hand it over to ringcase to give a vote of thanks my sincere thanks to all the uh wonderful uh speakers as well as our eminent cheer persons uh thanks a lot to all the delegates uh who uh enjoyed i i hope they enjoyed very well uh our next webinar which is the last one is on 13th december so kindly uh just lock it and your feedback is very important so please fill your feedback and return to us i want to say uh thanks to all the organizing team members advisor and executive committee members i also want to thanks guys bionext for the educational grant and our surname touch which is even partner thanks a lot we'll meet on 13th december 4 30 pm onwards thank you very much thank you thank you arun bye guys thank you bye bye bye thank you charles thank you thank you thank you bye thank you bye bye you", "Dv99OddUSYg": "welcome back full of youtubers fellow viewers fellow subscribers fellow meditators fellow fellows well tonight's videos a little different than most um I got um I got this great idea I've been throwing back and forth with camera guy him and I back and forth back and forth back and forth how to do a review for this product and you know what I think we're just going to keep it organic what do you think Kamik I don't like it organic cuz the wraps are organic just gonna keep it organic we're gonna kind of just make a smoke session kind of thing I'm just going to tell you a little bit about this and then we're just gonna use it like we'll just smoke session you'll get to see whether or how it works whether it works whatever and then when we're done smoking we feel like we've reached the point where we can you know call it an end or whatever we'll tell you a little bit about our experience put the product even though you're watching I mean we can recap and we're gonna give it a number rating we want to do anything like that this video yeah keep it organic if it happens it happens all right very good so we got here I don't know if you can see it this way turn it torso light there okay see King pyre are they cold many rules now there are many different sizes and I went to king prank on I can put that in the description if you guys want you do you want but um you know you do you want it in there you wanna be able to read something yeah you know so I'm just gonna put on my glasses and I'm gonna read you what it says here on the website and then mood just smoke wish I started how about real leaf real people real quality I sounds sweet already enjoy hand-rolled natural leaves for those looking for the best slow burning natural leaf on the planet put the synthetic and the factory product wraps to rest King palm leaves are chemical and preservative free they do not contain any artificial flavors and they contain zero glue that's pretty cool the natural corn husk filter will be one of the best voter tips you have ever used it will help to make sure no loose herbs will fall through and will also eliminate oils from getting into your mouth Wow we are confident that you will find these natural leaves to be much better quality and much cleaner than the common wrapping paper on the market the leaves are very slow burning and are very resilient they can be brushed with water for rehydration they are hand picked clean with purified water and rolled this leaf from the flowering tree of the cordilla family originated from Singapore rainforest where it offerors us offers it I'm sorry where it offers us the best smokeable leaf in the world it's pretty hot only the finest for you can pop right on rockin take sorry I lost my place there that doesn't happen in a long day sleep [Music] so here if it is and open this up will not see now it says on the back to uh just to remove the paper I'll look at the Hat is paper that's pretty cool it's not plastic he plastic that's pretty sweet now that one foot size is like king size word supposedly just looks like we'll just throw them all out here pretty sweet-looking King palm funky stick and took a just take the papers out of here I would think just a paper off so let's so don't get none of that fun stuff in the shot are you camera guy well I was gonna surprise you all one at a time what we're gonna do camera guy he got too close too quick alright so here we go is a I'm keeping it organic or organic organic so what I was thinking is maybe like oh wow so here's that corn husk but is pretty durable I don't know if you guys can see that and it's pretty sweet I mean I'm I'm squeezing it it's not it's not compressing too easily so let's thinking what we could do is maybe put some some rosin on the outside of it or something you know kind of like give it a glaze so let's uh let's fill it first so basically we're just gonna we just got some catalyst here some plant matter we have a string in here um because we're just smoke session again it's more about this product we're not even gonna worry about what this is I mean we're trying out this i'm sure the name really doesn't matter at this point I mean maybe what do you think you think the name matters camera guy I do you think it's just just pack it up and enjoy the paper [Music] okay so we're gonna love you guys can see this but you use oh no I guess you could use this end to start it in and kinda Ram it on in there with this pudding which they make it just want enough to get that pokey thing in there it looks a linguist now they said these aren't glued together so I guess the band is what's holding it together here yeah I would take it so my plan here was to kind of roll all like a Omega pun blunt maybe cuz we're gonna add a bunch of stuff to it may have grown just enough so just about done probably one more no more firecracker to sucker up once you stuff away so maybe I should leave a little divot and we can pack this end with like have to send with Keef to start maybe talking poison to jump down here Joel do this that's that's pretty bad it's pretty awful so that's a month juicy from key so what I was thinking was going pack this down in there maybe like see house let's uh see some some up just take this in here just got like a dimple in it very end let's just pack it down in there yes so it's like that what you think camera guy very cool very efficient and then let's go with them let's go let's say this put on the outside and go from there we think do it just do it just do it just do it alright so I'll use a little spatula thing here can you see yeah it was kind of can I just pick a spot here and just start to smear it on I guess maybe it's pretty durable the wrap it's not crumbling or cracking and raising that's really cool music camera guy making your mouth water okay so we got that all over it you can see how glossy it is she the standout no because no we're gonna have to multitask okay so what that and that now this camera guy we got this Platinum X CBD I've got this from the from the East Coast supplements in Harrisburg II small good to think for a moment where I got it from well this is a thousand milligrams one gram well actually it says point 5 gram teach see free that's a thousand milligrams I guess or something I don't know I don't know I don't really know I'm gonna do a review on this later but we have it so we're gonna use it give you guys like a sneak peek at what this stuff is only because I think it'll go great on the outside of this thing so let's uh wow that's really nice I think we're just kind of oh these are fingers ring kind of spread it out some oh yeah that's pretty cool okay camera got anyone hope that no throw this back in its case quick we think it looks crazy it's crazy so we'll call this the so let's eat here all right so this palm blunt is weighing in with let's say near a gram and a half of CBD flour we're not gonna say what kind then the end is packed with juicy fruit teeth which is 17.2% CBD and then we put the rosen's from what company was Ephraim Rosen remember where's Constance I uh Wisconsin and then the Platinum X CBD isolate all over the outside of it from East Coast supplements I think this is gonna be a pretty nice smoke what do you think we think I hope it's they're going in early I'm trying to get that way in the back what's he saying no don't do it come on don't worry dying that way in the back it's alright we're we're veterans here we know what we're doing well over to the road - you know you guys fight like why would you put that on the front because it's just gonna burn up while you're like well it's pretty thick for 1/4 - I think it'll help I thought maybe it would help to give it a more uniform burn what it is doing can't even really taste a bomb we're getting down to the good stuff so we'll give this to camera got yours run a little bit ego you did on that that's pretty nice I know you see you probably can't even taste the paper or the leaf really well that's very nice Danna and smoke is really cool I mean like I'm not hacking and coughing yet yet maybe you want to get down a little lower it might get a little stronger but so far actually pretty nice what happened is it running I'm gonna run all weird cuz it's got all that stuff on the outside of it like well up in some places [Music] Wow I feel like an instant Russian calm like BAM if you could see what camera guy did that was pretty funny sorry no we have a favorite table top channel we like to watch and camera guy enjoys the the sound effects death that the gentleman who whose channel it is the sound effects the things he does now look see what I think the oil welling up down this we kind of got a hold it this way now cuz it's it's really building up whatever you see it yeah it's blowing up guys it's not burn it on that side too well do you know I've seen some more pre-rolls it have stuff all over I have to get one of two but they have another cold like caviar getting closer some kind of sort of hot boxing it to keep it burning that's not so bad it's getting better it's actually holding up really well like the cherry on the end like the ashes kind of kind of pack really well there you go that's not so bad wow talk about relaxed I am SuperDuper SuperDuper relaxed that's amazing these hold up to a really good uh custom build you know put a lot of good stuff in there Yanis it's good it's due it's holding up nice of me now I don't normally own when we smoke like leaf much I mean maybe they do this leaf whenever you get like the CBD wraps forever but it just looks like a wrap and overlay uh I don't really use many of these kind of like pre-rolled leaves I know there's some that are made from banana leaf but the I think they're cold nature bees or something like that like little seeds in them in the bottom or your for your mouth pieces up your crutches I'll have to get some and show you guys maybe it'll be a later it will definitely be later I mean the cracks definitely is a taste of your lips does it I mean like a for later video so like we Zig the rapper I think the rapper is pretty cool is plastic on one side paper any other look house let's call King phones gonna crown there it's got really awesome like directions and instructions on the back we're not gonna go through that I already gave you a rundown of the product so it seems shorter than what was on the back here that's why I actually did it the droll end is really fat it's almost like a camel wide I think we know what a camel wide is out there I was smoking when he came a wide sported I was smoking cigarettes and I quit since so I know what a camel why it is couldn't imagine smoking that stuff now mm-hmm that's what the end reminds me aligns me the size of a camel wide I like the fact that it's cornhusk your table guy before I smoked at all what cup durable it is darn kidding when it says it'll hold up little stand up it's one reason why I was thinking maybe to put to test even his slow running you know for you guys out there see ya I'm feeling it like four and a half I like that I like it if you've already been covered in like resin in and I slit either game of the fly but we had to do that so Bhutto says don't smoke the band and don't remove the band so the band is probably what holds it together and probably where the band shows up is probably where the filter starts so almost be done with this one here get one or two more there you go um what if I could that's kind of think I don't know if I could flip that one around like I do a regular cigarette rather not sure super slow burning I think it went for quite a while between two people one person was smoking it'd probably be a pretty decent little like kick back and watch something and kind of chill enjoy that be like a cigar oh yeah what kind of burnt like that sort of in a way if you know he's like I've tried to play it off but he was actually back there about catching on fire so anyway yeah so with the four and a half that's really cool I guess we're turning this briefly into a review what I recommend a product would you recommend the product yeah that's good for a free room fill it up take it on the go it's better than a Bronco it's got some individuality for you let's lose man you know people's processed or not you can talk to your friends you like yeah what are you smoking I spoke of palm leaves King pounds I'm gonna maybe like it in California or a long beach or somewhere these are probably popular people maybe add their fun stuff in it and go to the beach maybe possibly but uh I like it it works um I'm one of the people as long as it works that does what it says I do why not buy it I mean anything else you wanna do over here you really are camera guys favorite I love the name man ticket oh yeah this is pretty nice that's a really nice name I think it's pretty original yeah definitely yeah I was like I don't even I want to know the story guy wants to know how you came up with that name that's pretty good yeah maybe he can do an Origin video what happe cool Hey how I became also while we're here um I do have some new strings are coming out well not strange but new uh the companies we're gonna be doing videos for the next coming week check them to drop some names noisy noisy

okay and right off the bat it's gonna be a bit of a different day and I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do I'm actually not going to the gym really today because I'm going to another gym and I'm probably getting a membership at this gym so I'm gonna take you with me and I'm gonna explain to you everything I'm doing give you the calories macros show you the meals show you how I'm gonna make some stupid gates anyways here's the weigh-in on the screen right now as you see 23.8 and I should be heading around to a four inch so I'm right on track but we'll go through all that stuff as we go right right now I'm just going to read I'm also gonna put up my to sleep right here on the screen so as you see I got like over eight hours of sleep which is not usual for me it's usually around 7:00 so that's good ready for a good day I'm gonna read do one morning stuff checking with you in that first meal you know how dogs gotta have that water on deck first thing I do is chug this liter of water don't forget to drink your water I'm gonna show you how I drink five to six liters a day so I decided to use fresh book out to record the wings believe mast phase the reform and yeah we're good to go a lot of people would ask me why do I wake up at 4:00 a.m. especially now I work from home and the reason is because I kind of built the had a bit over the last two years of waking up at this time and I like it I like being up before the sun's about beating up before everybody else is up gives me some quiet time to do stuff for me and I like early morning workouts get it done first thing in the morning cross the day after that but in today's case I'm going over to a different gym I gotta go later so the plan right now is I already read I'm going to basically fast for a little while longer it's about 5:00 a.m. right now and I'm just going to do some work with my laptop that I got to do for the next two hours or so and after that I'll probably have the first meal or actually I'm probably gonna save the first meal first shortly before the gym so check in with you we'll see work gonna be building some ads and calories macros that I'm hitting for today are gonna be on the screen right here so it's just under twenty nine hundred that is before cardio so we'll see how much cardio I get done at the new gym of course my eating schedule is gonna be different today because my first meal is usually I've already had it I'm probably gonna skip the typical banana protein shake meal so we'll see how I fit in all the calories and this is going to get me bulken at a good pace and that is the goal also I'm going to be making sure that I bring tripod with it's a real camera like the serious camera that I used to shoot on my other videos throughout this vlog series so the quality is gonna be stepped up for these vlogs and not just iPhone vlogs unless you guys like the iPhone vlogs if so let me know in the comments below and I'll just keep bringing it this way it's easy to pump on content this way so anyways I'm gonna get to work two hours I'll see you then and I know I keep saying I'll see you in this mat whatever but I just want to show you I'm just brewing up a quick chai tea it's got a little caffeine give me a quick boost keep me focused while I stay fasted and the reason I'm staying fast it has nothing to do with that you're fat lost enough like that hopefully you know that by now but instead it's just a way for me to push back my eating window that way it's easier for me to hit my calories and make sure I don't go over them by keeping it in a small window so what I do for the day obviously I've got as you'll see my prep meal spray so I basically input three of these meals in advance so I look I'm like okay rice chicken turkey sweet potato and sweet potato and chicken so I'm gonna go ahead and input all three of those and as well as some other little snacks and whatnot throughout the day so I try to input all my calories beforehand it allows you to stay strict with your calories throughout the day it keeps you accountable and it's just easy because you know what to eat to stay on point so it's harder to mess up so that's one way I'm going to be going about it today and that's I typically do obviously a lot of the blogs I show you are the ones that I mess up on which is hilarious but today I'm going to show you how to stay super strict hit macros on point and now I gotta get back after 8 a.m. and I am gonna have something before I have my shake and that's gonna be the banana and protein shake that I usually have I'll go ahead and put the calories macros up it's typically about 9 to grip damn these are some big bananas what anyways I'm gonna have one of these okay a little bit of protein powder and I've got two calls I'm gonna be jumping on from 9 to essentially 11:45 now in between the two calls is what I'm gonna make my power shake which have you been watching me already know what that is and I'm gonna have that because it's about just over an hour out from my workout I want to make sure that I have something that fills me up whereas a banana and a protein shake that just very quick I would usually have this 30 minutes before my workout instead of an hour out so I'm gonna have the power shake an hour out and then we head to the gym so check in with you what does power she thinks just got off the one call now I've got another call in 14 minutes this feels a little weird because I'm not used to going to the gym at this time if you've known if you've been following all of my things all of my series episodes and everything so the last like two years I actually can't remember the last time I went to the gym at 11 a.m. that's right this is extremely late for me but it was the only time I can actually go to Fordyce West which is the gym I'm gonna be training it today only time I'm able to go there for a free trial today but I'm likely gonna sign up when I go and then I'll be back to the 5:00 a.m. I'll show you guys around and all that given that I can hopefully record and which I don't doubt I can and so now like I mentioned I'm gonna go ahead and have this power shake these are the frozen strawberries I like to put in it but this power shape I typically have so I've got protein powder oats I've got dark chocolate creatine I've got spinach and the frozen berries and these are really really good low calories and yeah so the reason I'm having this pre-workout is again this is gonna hold me over for the next hour in a bit that I'm gonna be on another call and that carries me over to the gym because I'm on a very tight schedule today I have to get there as soon as or as close to 11 a.m. as possible and so I'm gonna have this now so that way once I finish the call I get my stuff and I'm gone and I'm watching some Eric Helms revived stronger I've been watching a lot of training stuff getting me pumped up for the goals that I've got set for this series so with that said I'm gonna stop talking I'm gonna drink this I'm going to jump on the call and I'll catch you at the gym or on the way to it let's go just after 10:50 I have to take my shirt off because I was in the boiler room - making sales calls the sales call didn't go as planned it's alright if it happens it's all good had a good conversation and you know it's time to hit the gym now I want to show you this I'm gonna be taking one of these zero calorie energy drinks it's like a little energy drink tastes pretty good but yeah I'm gonna have this as my little pre-workout I'm gonna sip on this as I head out to the gym and it's time to crunch these light Fordyce west by the way I forgot to mention this I finished this and it has zero calories okay zero calories so I'm not putting that in macros enough in anyways time to get this workout but the leg day today I'm going for a top set PR keep them on my form is revamped and all that so I'm just gonna do my top set PR with squats I do a few more back off sets after that and then from there I don't actually have a plan as to what else I'm gonna do because they've got all different types of equipment of machines here so I gotta figure out which ones are gonna use in the future as again I'm likely gonna sign up giving everything goes well today so anyway so let's go inside all right that was sick so check it out guys this is the new gym I'm gonna be training at I'm actually training at the other gym as well but you're gonna be seeing a lot of clips of this one this is called Fortis West it's actually been shown on some popular YouTube channels like Alomari sauce it is a sick training facility we jumped it off with squats and you'll see 295 there for three but the point of that was to keep the reps as clean as possible and the top set PR you'll see explained in when I explained my new workout program to you why I'm doing that top set PR to essentially set the weights set the pace for the program and after that we go into really just some volume for the legs so starting off with stiff like deadlifts like this or rdls you could call them Romanian deadlifts these torched my hamstrings and glutes for actually about a week later it's it's been almost a week and my hams and glutes were destroyed from this and as you see this gym is sick it's got plenty of equipment and things that you don't see at many gyms I'm just talking here and talking about how it's ass again so I hate cardio and all that there's not a lot of cardio here so and it is far away from my house but it's definitely worth the drive have been there a few times and anyways it's honestly owned by one of the top power lifter power lifters in history Jeremy Hamilton at least I think it's in history I'm not sure but anyway the point is the atmosphere everything's great and they have a machine like this called the hip quad developer which is insane way better than a leg extension helps with your squat and stuff so anyways that's a brief clip to the workout it was a killer and be looking for more clips at this gym and more gains from it too Cheers alright alright so I had to rush back here I'm actually late kind of expected that to be honest I guess that's probably why I'm late toss the glasses on and just showered that workout was sick signed up for membership my eight ounces of chicken one half cups of rice as well as 35 grams of walnuts counters the matches on the screens of this meal I gotta eat this up real quick and hit up some more car guys I just finished off a quick snack the rest of these crackers which there was only eight so it's 180 calories plus whatever was left of this hummus which was definitely under two tablespoons going I'm gonna go ahead and put in two tablespoons anyway calories and macros on the screen snack all right so before I continue on and jump on another call I'm gonna finish off this which is my third and a half liter once I finish this for the day I'm a little bit behind typically I would have already had four liters by now but I'm also going to stretch and when I stretch I basically go downstairs and I do some mobility as well so stretch on that carpet full body stretch and I'll do some mobility with my bands specifically for my shoulders my chest my posture my traps I'll roll out with the ball and all that so I'm gonna go ahead and do that real quick then it's back to work all right let's go coming up and I do have one more call coming up I just want to quickly quickly go through Fordyce West I just joined up today and as you guys maybe saw I don't know if I got enough footage of it but the gym is absolutely a dream and the reason I joined over there it's actually a bit of a drive for me is because with these massive goals that I'm looking to bring here to my physique in terms of muscle and strength gain I figured I needed to switch things up I needed to go to a gym where I surround myself with smart strong serious lifters on a whole other level and Fortis is that place not to mention it's got all the equipment and more that I've ever seen in any gym before and it's just overall a nice place and a true lifters dream so with that said I'm super pumped to be joined up there and I'll probably be doing most of my workouts there so I'll be looking for some really great compound workouts that I'm gonna be bringing a lot of new muscle and strength game programs and workouts that I'll bring at that gym with some pretty unique equipment and some variations you can use bands change all that stuff so super pumped that said let's check out the next you know that we got over here which is of no surprise let's show you right now actually it's gonna be yeah you know what I'll wait you go I've got two hundred and twenty grams of Turkey I've got 250 grams of sweet potato one cup of mixed veggies and that's it for this meal back to work 250 grams of sweet potato eight ounces of chicken one cup of rice this is my last big meal and after this I just got some finishers like a bit of fruit and this will be a for the day you're gonna see how on point I had these calories and macros it is sick I haven't put the fruit in yet so I'm going to be slightly over calories that's always okay when I'm gonna bulk now like I am so yeah I'm just gonna get back to some work through some things calling it an early date today it had a ton of calls and kind of stuff to do was running around a lot so I don't have much plan for the rest of the day really just planning out the date tomorrow and tomorrow's a breast date at the gym so I'm just going to go into world gym and do some cardio get that done and let's keep this bulk going so I'll check in with you in a bit to show you how I finish it off top off the calories okay liter five water is done now I'm just filling it up for tomorrow actually I'm gonna turn you for the day and that is it I get at least five sometimes six liters of water in a day very important for your recovery so don't forget to get your water in always my tip is getting a liter jug just like this one right here and then you know it's almost like you're playing a game right just got to finish five of these I typically finish three to four before 12 p.m. and I skip on the rest for the rest of the day so now I'm actually gonna take off go for a walk my day is basically done I'm gonna go for a walk listen to an audiobook or a podcast and then that's gonna help me burn some more calories just to make sure but I stay roughly even I'm gonna come back eat some fruit relax get ready for bed alright so it just got back from the walk and it turns out I made the decision on the walk back that I'm actually now going to be adding in any more calories for the day so here is my ending calorie using macros for the day as you see I hid everything very very on point which is good just a bit off here and there which is basically on point calories were all good now the reason I feel full and that's why I'm not going to be adding in any more calories is because I back loaded my food today due to the late workout and a lot of work and running around so I really stuffed in a lot of calories later on through the day back loaded it and that's giving me the fuller feeling and it's gonna skew the way in most likely tomorrow morning even with the extra burn calories so because of that I'm gonna keep my calories where they are no adding in the Kiwis at the end and just relax now for the rest of the day do some mobility some stretching and yeah these plans for tomorrow and then I just go to bed after that and start up again tomorrow like I said it's a breast-- day so thanks for watching and I hope you guys enjoyed this one if you did hit the like button comment below if you like this style of vlog the style of

rosemary one rule you do sadly to our international friends you do have to be based in the uk to win this competition so i'm sorry we can't be shipping gin in these times now the other thing is in the tart you don't have to use gin it's obviously just put in because i wanted to use the gin but it can be done with lemon juice and or no no juices at all but when we get that later on so don't think about using gin with children or anything but you won't be because i wouldn't if my kids were around but so if i had kids now let's begin we need to begin so we need to pull it in now don't we need to put the oven on you need to put your oven on to 200 now i know it says 180 but i want it higher today right so please 200. the reason yeah the reason being because i'm going to zap it a little bit quicker now have you got your flour in the bowl please i have well first of all do we need to soak the gelatin stuff oh yes so the gelatine in gym first a couple of tablespoons of gin just put it in jen in gin yeah soak it in so just how many steamed strange things or soak in your gin or soak it in cold water one or the other cold water go to the gym treat the kids treat the kids cold water for kids tarts gin for adults just one just one that's it guess what ha yes that's perfect just one yeah okay it's 1.5 grand martin's just telling me reminding me that i have to do the size 1.5 grams right okay well i'm just going to put hang on i'm not doing water i'm doing the gin where are your oh it doesn't matter how much gin you put in good go soft like that okay there we are all done three tablespoons fine oh just pour the ginny don't worry about the table spoons martin let me just pour it in i can hear him i can hear him now remember right ovens on gelatin let's get on with it let's me let's get over there now we're going to put the flour in the bowl which people will we have already and i haven't hang on right in a bowl now remind me how many grams of flour right do 200 grams of flour plain flour right plain flour scales are on good look at this hang on oh this is good this reminds me of my trip to colombia oh why is that tell me well i'm absolutely nervous okay sorry go for it come on get on with it don't right you need to get 100 grams of unsalted butter or butter that's about it well i've got yes i'm glad you said that because i ignored the unsalted bit because i don't like unsalted butter no it's fine doesn't it that's fine and how many 100 just 100 yeah it's fine just a hundred oh nearly i thought i've got it right straight off like you normally do you can put a bit more if you want but i'm making it easy to work with because a real high butter pastry has a bit more butter than that but i felt getting it to work is the most important thing well i agree i agree i've got my butter yeah okay now put it in get it up there we go now what we need to do is make it into do it and put it into breadcrumbs so it resembles yes we've done this before when we did scones didn't we we did exactly the same way oh you see i'm learning yes you are you are you're getting really good look i had to put silver hot pants underneath because my strawberry was a bit see that actually my hair's so long and i've got a picture of me with my hair like this when i was so much younger it's it's absolutely hysterical well i know but i bet you they can't wait for hairdressers to open i want actually do they prefer my hair like this or not oh yes let's have some beauty tips do we prefer the rosemary's hair longer or shorter now how short would you normally go i'd normally do a bob i thought you're going to say i'm not bigger bald i don't really get there but about that there oh okay where my mouth is well well i think i like it longer do you what do you think about sharon osbourne going from red to gray i have no idea i haven't have you not seen it well i'm nearly ready and one thing make sure you comment and tell us if you are cooking along at home if you are cooking along home just say the word tart i'll know what you mean ah that's brilliant now once you've got it into breadcrumbs i hope you're all ready okay yes i think we are what i'm going to do is put one whole egg into the bottom a whole egg no no yolk or anything just one more leg and then the other one is going to do oh let me just turn my sound down on this there we go one whole egg now i'm going to use a duck egg and one yolk oh okay oh a duck egg is really big so i'm not using what i have to do okay one okay so we've got 200 grams of flour 100 grams of butter one duck egg one duck egg and i've got a yolk plus one whole egg okay right what we're going to do now oh hang on you've got to put the sugar in one year so i did actually not use my duck egg i went for a normal hems eggs how do you separate the yolk and do you do it in your fingers yeah i just put it in yeah i do separately just don't separate that i've just broken that egg hang on rosemary i'm just separating the yolks i broke an egg okay putting the egg whites in here because we've got a lot of egg whites later on okay martin's telling me what to say i like it martin is on it's martini okay right okay so the sugar is going in there now put the sugar in uh oh okay let's see now hang on the golden sugar or the caster sugar you've got the cost 50 grams of caster sugar all right golden sugar rosemary golden castor all regards to sugar all right fine fine hang on hang on how much sugar how much sugar right just 250 grams of sugar 50 grams i know some of you at home might have weighed this out but at least if they haven't i'm at least oh let's put 60 65 don't worry don't worry people it's all right i'm not worried i've learned from you i've learned from you just don't worry now i'm putting in a tablespoon of water oh that's a bit boring can we not use the gin no well you can do actually if you want to yes oh no let's not make it too alcoholic and when i put water in now when i put a little bit of gin there we go i've tried a tiny bit more guys don't do this right bring it in now what we're going to do put it together oh now this is the one hand trick that i've learned from the one hand bring it in so you don't end up filthy bring it in everyone bring it in that's it so you make a nice dough that's perfect now mine's kind of sticky well if it's sticky i'll show you what to do right what we're going to do now okay bring it in there we are that is spot on i'm now going to put roast reminds a bit mine's a bit sticky like this should i put some more flour in perfect no no don't right we're going to okay lower on the top all right so what we're going to do don't put it in with it bring it up on there there we are okay so glass in the workspace let me be artistic all right now make sure you're sharing this everyone if you want to win this gym share share share now make sure what is important here is you're not going to need it like bread you're just going to bring it together like a there we are just bring it together but don't work it too much because what you don't want to do is toughen the gluten toughen the gluten the gluten i've made i've started making some lovely sourdough today so it's delicious oh let's say again sorry salad oh rosemary people are saying they like your long hair better oh fanta really that's interesting okay thank you guys yes you see and the more gin the better is the rule okay now right go on okay right stop talking we're going to now put it into a lot i always put it into a nice long nice long log right nice long long right we are having now to actually put quite a lot of flour on because it's soft now this is soft obviously i would have put it in the fridge but we haven't got the time so what i'd like you to do is watch me what we don't want to do is press too hard because it's soft so there we go like that now and once it's got to there you just roll it up and we're just going to go like that don't worry about the amount of flour in there we just have to do that get over okay so one more time everyone at home don't be doing it yet keep watching just keep watching it's just i want to give you the confidence to do it because you may say oh it's too soft but actually if you do it gently you will get it done i promise you now at this stage i'm just going to do that right that's finished and done right so hang on we need to do this at home now no i can't i'm going to do this first so what i'm going to do is pop this butter this butter butter your ring so you can make sure you button it before you've rolled it actually that would be better you need to do it straight away as soon as you roll because it will get too soft now okay so keep watching i put it onto a map guys no i have to do this i put it onto a mat okay you don't just to clarify you don't have to use a ring you can be using a flan dish as well yes you can use anything fine fine because that's what i've got guys i've got one of these if you're like me you've got a certainly hang on guys i'm looking at my picture this isn't well if you tidy your drawers down you'll be able to find it right all i'm going to do is do that kind of brush yeah i've got a brush all i can do is do that turn it over that's perfect okay now do that find them yes yes find this and then like that now bring it up really bring it up okay like this can

eggshells in the egg whites and the egg yolks were dropping in right the milk is coming up to the boil good right turn it okay just put it to one side if it's boiling right what i'm going to do now with the corn flour the flour and the sugar and also the vanilla yes oh my gosh i'm running old round vanilla lovely nelson massey vanilla yes which you sent me some in the post thank you rosary it's the most wonderful piece right just whisk it all up right uh hang on so so so so right in the bowl what am i putting in sugar caster sugar okay watch that what you're going to do oh yeah three caps so the milk is boiling you have to have 20 grams of flour um two teaspoons of corn flour 20 grams of spoon 20 grams oh hang on flowers 20 grams of flour yeah yes two teaspoons of corn flour let me just take oh my milk's all right it's not boiling ah look at this many this is my house you cook like this for a living i'm exhausted two teaspoons yeah you're doing corn just doing really well yes and a tablespoon of vanilla paste or whatever you want in there this looks so oh gosh a tablespoon let's do it let's do it and also 70 grams of sugar just regular caster sugar oh wow i use billington's golden sugar i love that oh well you well i've got waitrose i'm just as posh how much how much did you say 70 grams do you know all this is it just stores in your brain somewhere in the roads of your head [Laughter] right are the egg yolks in here too right okay now we are going to now whisk all that up oh that looks yummy okay so i'm just going to stop it so i am whisking the egg yolks the flour the sugar the corn flour and the vanilla that's right oh yes that looks good that looks good okay yes now you're going to add the boiled milk in to what's that you've got on there that's just your mixing bowl just my mixing bowl and i'm going to put it back into the pan all right so the hot milk goes in your mixing bowl mixture and you stir it quickly all i'm going to do is whisk it till it's really thick right okay i am with you i am back with you right so are you with us are you all keeping up guys tell us at home if you want me to bang the bell um and i will do that but i think we're all right actually do you know what did you realize you haven't run the bell yet i know well that's because i've been too busy running around to find the bell it's under half a load of okay keep going things keep going we are still going right we're whisking we're whisking we're whisking right thickening up have you got quite a high heat rosemary yes i have but i'm whiskey oh yes yes it really suddenly starts to go now the reason we're doing this because we're working quickly today so you know i have to uh do things a little quicker than usual right mine is looking really thick i'm going to take mine off okay this is how it looks okay where's the camera oh okay teaching you martin just don't martin she's on a mission tonight don't cross rosemary schrager don't you dare i'm not sure anymore he's scared of you now he's scared of you now it's getting thicker mandy barrett said i'm showing my knickers i know i am i've got no choice they're not knickers they are still the hardest can i see what it looks like when it should be done how thick oh yes you're right mine needs to be thicker right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to right while we're waiting for hours tell us what you're doing now rosie what are you doing right so what i've done is because i need it to cool down really quickly so what i've done is oh hang on i need to ring the bell people have asked me to ring the bell okay right so what i've done is all i've done is i've put it on my tray to spread it out so it's a bigger area to cool down quickly so i'm not going to do anything else for the moment just put this here i think that's done rosemary is that done it was thicker before now it's gone thin again what it'll stick it will set anyway that should be fine i think it's fine yeah it's a bit it's a bit thin than no look look it's not hang on let me just hang on i don't think it is let me have a look now let me have a look hang on hang on right look this is in my dish it'll go firmer but really but that's just leave it to cool down quickly it'll go firmer as it cools down but it's probably not as thick as it should be but that's fine don't worry about it did you put enough corn flour in maybe not but you know what maybe people how are you getting along at home is yours i hope you're getting on okay but it doesn't matter if it's thinner because don't worry about it no marie did you know something there is hundreds of people watching and there has only been 50 people share the video so far and people might not realize if you share the video you could win a bottle of norfolk oh you must share it for free so share it for the channel you must share that video exactly now look i think i'm perfect i think i will now check my perfect perfect just leave it do you know what the ultimate test is no no it's not no it's fine it's fine okay let me see my tart do not talk to martin like that oh now how long five minutes left mine says right okay so this is doing my tarte is doing incredibly well so what i'd like to do now how dare you talk about me like that rosemary i am trying my best well i would like to start doing the the lovely jelly on the top oh yes all right so just turn me hop off this is very simple no you'll need it off thank you lisa swarbrick has shared it janice is shedding we'll need you done right you'll need it on your hob because you've got to okay let's go for this right does anyone else find after queens of the kitchen their kitchen is trashed because we do mine's not yes because you have martin that mops around every five seconds that's why no he's not he's playing director and being bossy with me oh well it's not like you to be bossy is it rosemary no okay now this is the next thing he's lovely now listen this is the next thing we're going to put in here no no not we're going to put our gin we're going to put our gin and the the soft gelatine in here now those who've got lemon juice soften it with a lemon juice okay we are now now rosemary rosemary so there's my little horrible gelatin thing perfect i put quite a lot of gin in my little bowl don't use the door just a bit just a bit we're just gonna heat this up okay so i'm not gonna put some lemon juice in because you know so oh look at us using our gin cooking with gin everybody i must say it is quite frankly delicious so what will happen is gelatine leaf will help the whole thing set and obviously as well with the lovely raspberry jam so we're now going to put that in as well but how much jam i'm back over here three tablespoons oh a nice bit of jam i like jam put [Music] but never ever jam today carol channing i was singing there oh yes carol check out where that's from what's a jam song from people that are watching tell me i can't remember oh how are your talks doing at home everybody tell us how it's doing right okay we're just lovely heating this up and i'm going to put it through a sieve now you don't have to put it through a sieve is this just literally to melt the jam and mix the gelatin this is to take the bits out of the jam i know my hob is very hot it's very hard right save your jam now make sure you pour it over a bowl don't just pour it over the sink like i was about to do oh oh um rosemary we've got a lovely person called sybil watching from washington dc washington state no hi i hope you're enjoying this wonderful my dad go on simple go on to my instagram yes now what we were going to say something else about the instagram i don't know what we're going to say um something you did earlier uh yeah oh yes martin was just reminding me you can do the meringues the baby little raw shade meringue oh yes with the egg whites you've got left if you want to do baby meringues go on rosemary schrager's instagram she does a little recipe so we put the jam through a sieve yeah put it through a sieve now you don't have to put it through a sieve obviously because um if you don't want to you know it's fine it doesn't matter it's only up to now you do a strawberry tart exactly the same way so there you go rosemary somebody's asking what's the difference between a jam and a conserve a cop you mean a con yes close up um what it is a jam is it's sort of more it's more english really and the concept is more french i think um well there we go so if you're feeling exotic you can say concept right we have done that we have done now do we put it in the freezer anytime we just leave it no just leave it prepared now what i'm going to do is the next thing is the tartar's doing brilliantly right yes get your pastry get it out of the oven everyone get your pastry out the oven we're not ready to do it yet because you've got to put it back right but hang on gillette everyone get them out of the oven but don't turn your oven off no because you're going to pop it back in the oven right for another 10 minutes please we'll see right okay i'm just going to rotate my camera down so people can i'm going to show you my tart having a hot flush there's a lot of polyester in my berry would you help me chew on if that doesn't do it just turn that and it's really steep lower it lower careful joanne careful oh this is so nice down down hang on i can move back yes so what have we done so far okay let's have a look perfect now take it off take it off oh take it out oh my eggs grow that's fine put it back in the oven don't worry about that just put it back in the oven right put it back in the oven all right it broke in line it broke in like not a little bit hot it's easier to do than we thought right now back in the

mint and lots of cucumber and some soccer crepes what did you call me a soccer soccer crap it's a mediterranean pancake thing so it's like lamb cocktails with some dips and made with chickpeas chickpeas so what would it look like so it'll be lamb with some sort of dips and then it'll be like a pancake thing on the side yes it's like a big bit of a pancake so it's almost like a wrap it's a bit like a wrap yes but it yes well we can make it as a wrap it's absolutely fine i've got one in the fridge if you want to see do you want to see it as long as it's not half eaten or half chewed on no no it's not half eaten i am so proud of you all oh that's what it looks like hold it a bit oh by the way by the way up up up there stop oh delicious so people can have this for their dinner next week is that right it's another one where you can cook along and have your dinner afterwards i only write that test it today oh well keep practicing keep practicing when i work you might get it right when i say worked in the southwest now i want to say hello to my grandchildren holly and lola so hello hello hello how are you good they're saying very well oh fabulous i'm glad the family's watching my family's watching as always which is so lovely they love it and they absolutely love it if you didn't win a prize next week next week we will give away some prizes as well i think that's going to be a staple thing let's give away some goodies yes i think so now i need to get off this because this is a lot of polyester and it's very hard yeah i know well it's been lovely well done i want to congratulate you and i want to hear whether other people have done as well as you because you really did well tonight oh yes send us a picture of your tart everybody and don't forget next wednesday at six o'clock look at that we will be doing a sort of middle eastern mediterranean feast and the ingredients will be on facebook in the next couple of days you can cook along with us thank you for watching queens of the kitchen make sure you share tag someone who needs a bit of fun and we will see you all same time next week bye", "Ik1sGcWN3QE": "[Music]", "tuQxPpTNq8c": "so the time has now come for us to start addressing what many people think is the real stoichiometry problems where we go from a certain amount of one substance to a certain amount of another substance i use the road map approach which is that everything is based around moles so we can say i've got moles of a substance i can convert moles of that substance to grams using grams is moles times molar mass i can convert moles of one substance a to moles of another substance b by using the coefficients from the chemical equation and then of course once i've got moles of b i can convert to grams of b using the same grams as moles times molar mass except here of course now using molar mass of b whereas over here you would have used the molar mass of a i refer to the a side and i refer to the b side and so lots of times if you give them grams of one substance you convert that to moles in step one convert moles of a to moles of b in step two and then moles of b to grams of b in step three so be referring to this road map during these next few problems um sometimes i will explicitly show the roadmap other times i'll talk about the relationships that we see in there so starting off iron can be extracted from feo according to the equation below make sure it's balanced before we do anything else one on one iron one carbon one carbon two oxygens two oxygens calculate the mass in grams of iron that could be extracted from 20 kilograms of iron ii oxide okay so assigning everything here what do we know we know things about the iron oxide so i'm going to call that substance a and we asked about things for iron so i'm going to call that substance b so let's put all of that stuff in there a is feo multimass of feo that we may or may not use we obviously will 71.85 grams per mole and we got 20 kilograms or 2 000 gram 20 000 grams of feo and then substance b iron we know the molar mass of iron and the whole point is we want to get the number of grams of iron so step one is where we go from the grams of feo to the moles of fpo throw everything to the grams is moles times molar mass relationship 20 000 grams moles times 71.85 moles is 278.36 moles and so that's what's now in this box step number two we convert moles of a of fpo to moles of iron and we do that using the coefficients from the equation well fortuitously the coefficients are both one so moles of b which is moles of ion equals the 278.36 moles of substance a that we previously calculated one over one so the moles of b that's the moles of iron 278.36 moles that's what goes in this box and finally step three convert that to grams 278.36 moles times 55.85 grams per mole thus the number of grams of iron 15 500. other ways you could have done that you could have just done it with a percentages just multiplied to 20 kilograms by the 55.85 divided by 71.85 if you like ratios but i would prefer to just think about one general relationship one general process for solving stoichiometry otherwise known as the roadmap so unobtained from last furnace contains some sulfurs and purity this is removed during basic oxygen steel making by the magnesium which removes the sulfur as magnesium sulfide 350 tons of impure iron used for bos contain 0.02 of sulfur calculated mass in kilograms of magnesium needed to remove all the sulfur well first thing is we know about sulfur and we're asked about magnesium so therefore we assign things there's the sulfur is what we know about molar mass there's the magnesium that we are asked about for the mass okay now of course trouble is we don't actually know what to put in here for the sulfur we know that 350 tons of the impure ion contain 0.02 of sulfur so first thing we can do is calculate the mass of sulfur which is 350 tons times the 0.02 percent which equals 0.07 tons or 70 kilograms so there we are 70 000 grams can pop in there okay so add a little bit at the start do you understand what we mean by percent so let's go ahead and do it step one we have 70 000 grams of sulfur molar mass 32.06 so therefore we have 2183 moles of sulfur now for step two we need the coefficients of an equation we don't have an equation what we do we just haven't written out yet because we know we got sulfur plus magnesium making mgs so we'll put that down here just so we got it magnesium plus the sulfur is mgs so therefore the coefficients are both one and one that's jolly nice so moles of b which is of course magnesium over the 2183 moles of a that's the sulfur one to one so moles of magnesium 2183 that's what goes in that box there last step convert the moles of magnesium to grams of magnesium multiply the moles by 24.3 grams per mole molar mass which is 53 060 grams or of course 53 kilograms even 53.1 kilograms reaction with caco2 gareth good old gareth obtained 2.49 grams of pure dry calcium oxalate from 4.69 grams of a mixture that contain potassium oxalate and other substances calculate the percentage of potassium oxalate in the original mixture well here we've got a reaction in which we are told about the calcium oxalate and we're asked about the potassium oxalate so let's put in colors there pink for what we know brownish for what we don't know set up the road map replacing things calcium oxalate 2.49 grams told the motor master that potassium oxalate for which we are not told the molar mass here but relatively straightforward to get it is the unknown so i'm not going to dwell upon things just go through quickly enough or slowly enough to make sure we got the right numbers in step number one grams of calcium oxalate to moles so 2.49 divided by 128 grams small 0.0195 moles step number two going from moles of the calcium oxalate which is 0.0195 over to the moles of potassium oxalate here so we need the equation coefficients of the equation and what we find is that it's a one-to-one reaction a level examiners love one-to-one reactions for this stuff don't they so therefore the moles of b which is the potassium oxalate over the 0.0195 moles of a that we just calculated is one to one so we've got .0195 moles here of the potassium oxalate which we then convert to grams 0.0195 moles times 166 grams per mole so in this sample we had 3.24 grams of the potassium oxalate haven't quite finished yet just calculated that we got 3.24 grams of potassium oxalate but we wanted the percentage of that in the original mixture in the original mixture we had 4.69 grams so the percent of that is 3.24 grams we just calculated over the 4.69 total grams times 100 or 69.1 percent ammonia can be used as part of the nitrophosphate process to produce the fertilizer blah blah blah blah blah which has the formula blah blah blah blah so here's the equation and i've already colored everything in we know about the ammonia told we've got one ton of ammonia we're asked about the mass of dap that's this stuff in kilograms so with the road map what do we know about we know about the ammonia 1 million grams and we're asked for the number of kilograms or effectively grams on the road map of the dap here calculate the molar masses let's uh quickly make sure that this is correct for the dap nitrogen 14 plus 4 is 18 times 2 is 36 plus 1 is 37 plus phosphorus which is 31 gives us 68 plus 4 of the oxygen 68 plus 64 is indeed 132 grams per mole so same stuff we've done all the way through take the million grams of ammonia and convert it to moles by dividing by 17 grams per mole and we get 58 824 moles that goes in this box here now in step two we need to use the coefficients and finally we got some interesting coefficients don't we okay we've got the moles of substance b which is the dap and the coefficient of the dap is three so that goes on top matching up the moles of dap and then on the bottom we've got the moles of ammonia 58 824 that we just calculated here matching up with the coefficient of the ammonia which is eight punch that through your calculator and you find that the moles of dap is 22 059 now of course converting that first of all to grams we just take the number of moles 22 059 moles times the molar mass 132 grams per mole and that gives us whoa two million nine hundred eleven seven hundred and sixty four grams or realistically two thousand nine hundred and twelve kilograms um should really have called it to two thousand nine hundred and ten for significant figures because we got three significant figures in the tons of ammonia next one cooking fuel contains butane which reacts with oxygen according to now notice how naughty they are here putting in a fractional coefficient but it doesn't actually matter in terms of doing the calculation so if one mole of butane reacts calculate the number of molecules of carbon dioxide that will be formed well this is kind of a fun one isn't it we're told about butane and then we're asked about carbon dioxide so we can still go through applying the processes that we know first thing is we got moles of butane we can go from moles of butane to moles of carbon dioxide using the equation that we've sorted out before so moles of carbon dioxide over moles of butane coefficient of carbon dioxide is four coefficient of butane is one so thus we have four moles of carbon dioxide now we need to get the number of molecules for that well one mole is 6.02 times 10 to the 23. so 4 is 4 times 6.02 times 10 to the 23 or 2.41 times 10 to the 24 molecules of carbon dioxide those who have gone through the movies for stoichiometry know that molecules is actually incorporated into a larger version of the roadmap but i didn't feel was appropriate to bring in the larger version of the roadmap for just effectively this one problem reaction sequence to produce four bromophenol ethanoic acid there we are 4-bromophenyl ethanoic acid is shown below calculate the minimum mass of bromine ester aminomast bromine needed to convert 0.15 moles of methyl benzene that's the 4-bromo methyl benzene 2-4-bromo 1-bremer methyl benzene in the first stage so that's the 4-bromo 1-bromo-methylbenzene okay so essentially we're looking at this first part of the reaction so let's see we are told things about the 4 bromo methyl benzene and we're asked about the bromine so if we assigned things here we asked about the bromine we're told about the 4-bromo methyl benzene but we don't need all the stuff up here on the roadmap because we're already immediately told that we have 0.15 moles of the 4-bromo methyl benzene so the first thing we got to do then is erroneously here called step two because we didn't need a step one and that is converting the moles of four bromomethylbenzene that two moles of bromine needed and for that we need the chemical equation okay now let's make sure that we've got that right we've got ch3br plus br2 goes to that nice little product there but you've got to have something to do with the h that's been replaced by bromine and so plus hbr in other words even though there's only one extra bromine atom needed here we need a whole br2 molecule to do the reaction so that's moles of b which is br2 over the 0.15 moles that we start with is a one two one reaction and finally master bromine step three going from moles to grams and so 0.15 times molar mass of br2 159.8 grams per mole which is 23.97 grams relatively straightforward problem of course and indeed easier than the ones we've been doing because we didn't have to convert from grams to moles here but i thought putting it at this stage just to emphasize the importance of getting the right equation there moon is produced when amide heated with aqueous sodium hydroxide there we are in experiment 3.9 grams of the aliphatic amide t gave .06 moles of ammonia right there use this information to find the formula of the hydrocarbon group are present in the amide t isn't this a fun one well anyway it is a course starting off with a nice reaction um we've got moles of b equals coefficient of b moles of a okay so therefore the moles of the a mit divided by the ammonia because that's what we're told and asked about is one coefficient of t over two coefficient of ammonia so therefore we've got 0.030 moles of t okay now how does that help us well because we also know that we had 3.9 grams of t so in other words 0.03 moles of t weighs 3.9 grams so the molar mass which is grams over mole is 130 grams per mole how does that help us well because here's t we know the whole molar mass is 130 we know we've got nh2occo and nh2 so what's left is the r the formula of the r group can therefore be calculated so r has a mass of 130 minus 88 each of those co nh2 weighs 44 we got two of those so r has a mass of 32 we're told that it is a aliphatic so in other words there's no nasty little aromatic rings in there and so 42 has to be equal to c3h6 if we had two carbons 24 then there'd be 18 hydrogens that's not realistic and four carbons would weigh 48 which is of course too much slightly interesting little novel question the important thing to realize is that this 3.9 grams of tea is no use to you because you don't know what t is at least at the start so you have to use the ammonia to give you moles of t at which point the 3.9 grams becomes useful to go with the moles of t to give you the molar mass and hence identify the r group finishing off this section with a question that we could use the roadmap for but there are other ways to do certain stoichiometry questions and it's worth a while discussing those so chloroethanoic acid there we are is produced from ethanoic acid there we are by producing chlorine gas into under suitable conditions in an experiment 89 grams of ethanoic acid was reacted with chlorine calculate the increase in mass that occurs if chloroethanoic acid is the only organic product so we could have done a road map we could do 89 grams of ethanoic acid that would be the grams of a convert that to moles of ethanoic acid convert that to moles of the chloro-ethanoic acid which we would then convert to grams and then we could calculate the increase in mass or because we see first of all it's a nice one-to-one relationship and what we're doing is we're essentially relating ethanoic acid to an extremely similar species chloroethanoic acid we can set it up as a ratio question so we match up ch3coh to ccl3 cooh which has molar masses of 60 and 94.5 respectively so the mass of the cl ch2 blah blah blah the massive ethanoic acid reaching up the ratios with the molar masses 94.5 over 60 then of course we know the mass of ethanoic acid was 89 so we just multiply it through and that gives us that the mass of cl ch2coh the chloroethanoic acid was 89 times 94.5 divided by 60 140.2 so the increase in mass is 140.2 minus the 89 or 51.2 grams okay just a quicker way to do it and the only reason i'm doing it as the quicker way to do it is because i'm so good at the road map that i see first of all this is a one-to-one reaction so therefore any moles of this will be the same as moles of that so we can kind of remove those from consideration and then because they are just so similar only differing in replacing an h with a chlorine that i can just go ahead and do the ratio nothing wrong however if you decide you wish to do this using the roadmap grams of ethanoic acid two moles of ethanoic acid two moles of chloroethanoic acid two grams of chloroethanoic acid and you get this answer and then the final step would be the same regardless of how you obtained that value", "q2szm8CfB64": "hello everyone uh thank you for watching our special new class uh we are broadcasting again like from our hk office in cacao japan and we have a special guest today and that's our ceo mr fuji hello uh this is fuji speaking nice to meet you today i attended this event the first time and i want to show you uh my prof uh presentation of uh vegetarian diamond later i want to show you okay thank you okay so and give me a fuji like so it's like you know we are very excited to have mr fuji like for the first time in this special middle class and uh um so for those of you like who don't know much about like you know who mr fuji is like you know i i like to i like to introduce him and do like a bit of like introduction of him so we are we are doing this uh special noodle class uh by mr fuji like for the first time and um so mr fridge has been like working in various aspects of noodle industries for almost half a century he founded this company yamato manufacturing company he started out as a manufacturer of noodle machines designed for restaurants small production to produ produce fresh japanese noodles such as udon soba and ramen in designing these in designing these machines what he cares most about our deliciousness of the end product is we use and safety for this to materialize in the year's research on how the law making origins primarily by hand made fresh noodles and incorporate them into designs of these noodle machines because he thought that deliciousness of noodles made on the new machine what his customers cared most about he put it on his horse while they try out the designing of the machines so everything he cared in his career and keep creating very based on what is the biggest thing customers care about the middle schools a unique cooking method called digital cooking coming from an engineering background so he uh used to work as an engineer at the kawasaki industry aircrafts tanker ships and he had to develop ways for anyone to reproduce the same product with consistent quality every time like it's like assembly drawings for these machines so using digital cooking methods many of the graduates successfully build their own restaurants serving little issues and welcoming schools today we will share some of these special recipes that are vegan and also grateful takeout even frustration started damaging his customers primarily restaurants he's been thinking hard about ways to help them survive and even thrive in this crisis and the post profit 19 error he almost over half a year since fundamental profile and we've been trying to see what we can do and talking the existing customers in japan and other countries to determine how the business operations different customers should should be during the after practice so we have to admit that we haven't found the ultimate solution but a l is not a certain direction where we should go you'll continue to study and you try with again efforts and communications with the existing little restaurants in japan as well across the world to come up with new ideas business models and products because our goal is to help our customers succeed in the business for long term we'll continue to work on these issues and share them with people through an immediate way this class is going to be forced on these issues and uh did i share with you some of the things we've been working on since the financials we've been talking with them [Music] the sound um so the nature of kobe 19 and how so we put this class uh in the following and uh like so i'm gonna be explaining the uh the words from like no no wait so he uh during and after this called the danger crisis and well um so my my colleague is going to make the fresh noodles on the noodle machine after that and then we'll we'll have a we'll move to our kitchen where mr freeze is going to show two types of vegan ramen dishes that are that are also great for uh takeout and delivery and um lastly like we do the africa session at the last and last so um if you have some questions during the class please feel free to um send them in the comments and mr fuji is uh going to be like happy to answer your questions so um i've been talking about the uh the lecture part uh that mr fuji like has this for this lecture uh for this class um so the nature of kobe 19 and how to survive the coveted crisis so the true meanings of life and impacts the kobe 19 had on us what kobe 90 really has been to us is the destroy of businesses it's been killing many of the businesses that are growing productivity and not fit in the era of kobit 19. the death toll from kobe 19 japan has been small but it's been getting devastating impacts on the economy the united states has been severely damaged on both aspects and so we have this uh we have data that like uh that compares that in these countries these uh regions uh in january march period and uh april period and uh so china is the only one that's that's uh that did better during the uh and april and june period and like everyone else is like doing really bad so the population in each country when almost unchanged before and after probably 19 what changed their lifestyles and values and how people eat and this is also like data we have like for dining out markets like take out delivery markets and cooking at home market so basically people buy uh ingredients from supermarket and cook cook and eat at home uh so the uh in japan like they they categorize these markets um into like these three categories so um of course like restaurant business like belong to like dining out uh market size and then so like you know they had like comparison between like these periods and then uh so like these are data about like that of like japan's but like if you if you can check the kind of similar data of your country you know which market you should focus on and so to to summarize what happened in the market after kobe 19 the markets visited some of the markets we had disappeared and new markets and businesses emerged so how how food business should survive in the post office 19 time so we need to learn from like how we survive like a great turning point in the past we need to redefine our businesses to learn from like failures and successes we should unlock us our businesses in these free markets dining now cooking home taking takeout delivery these categories are just what economists created to make measurements easier there are many businesses big and small that could survive because they couldn't escape from the confinement of their business categories for example movie theaters were beaten by tv and other media companies so they need to redefine their business concept to embrace their businesses as entertainment businesses the same things are happening in all mobile industries for example tesla is a computer company that manufactures automobiles that combine functions with vehicles and computers google is a i.t company that invests heavily in autonomous cars for transparency transportation business uber and other car sharing companies redefined transportation businesses like traditional taxi businesses how can car companies survive competing against them they have to redefine the business concepts they need to think about transportation on scale or combination of luxury speed and entertainment we have to do the same for our businesses by looking at our industries and businesses from different angles so how can we survive kobe 19 and come up stronger we've been observing talking that our customers primarily new restaurants in japan and other countries over the past six months and they found out the following characteristics very common the restaurants that have done good or better than pre-kobe 19 period so the first one like product products fault is are high and they are located in suburbs with a large seating capacity and the sales of their sales for like takeout delivery ratio is high maybe like we we may you know be maybe like say the same things like in your country as well so the restaurant that haven't been doing good water the opposite at least in one or two of these points in short it's getting clearer how restaurants win or lose and what kind of restaurants can survive to survive to survive with nikoi post copy 19 era we need to focus on and take actions on the following six points the first one the deepening understanding of what your business is about so what is the true assets of your business we need to think about deeply serving on foods is only the means of business the essence of business is to solve customers problems for example the business classmate of starbucks is to provide thought places starbucks had a big sector globally with this business concept many businesses focus on short-term gains we need to aim for long-term success most businesses prioritize solving their own problems instead of customers for us to understand the essence of our business better we need to understand customers behaviors from their viewpoints and as food providers we need to focus on deliciousness high quality and being health conscious the second one is speed so smartphones have been changing our lives ever even after 13 years of when iphone came out in 2007. he also changed the apple out dramatically as a company there's almost nobody who does not rely on smartphones anywhere in the world now our business has changed as well like in terms of like how we communicate with our customers but 13 years ago but like probably 19 also changed the world dramatically the speed at which things change has been like fast and fast and now the time is the most precious resource for everyone so it's becoming essential for business to improve things to find some breakthrough route continually by continually walking through bdc pdca cycles so we need to fail fast to succeed at the fastest speed focus on customers the behaviors of customers change dramatically through copied 19. there's no way to win a business other than understanding customers behaviors we can naturally come up with what we need to do by understanding customers behaviors they're different from 3 copied 19 period we need to put ourselves in the customer's shoes and understand understand the inconveniences troubles or difficulties that customers are sensing customers who here fear infections are now willing to eat at restaurants without any measures against the virus they rather eat drink at home to take our meals so the fourth one is productivity we need to keep on doing and implementing the following endlessly to increase productivity for our survival compiling routine jobs into manual mechanization of automation we need to compile what we do daily into manual so that everyone else can do the same things at the same quality among them the biggest impact we can make is that automate sales you know how to sell our products but we customers ask us to sell our products to the to them we need to create a structure that makes that this happen labor saving automation are also important so we can spend more time and resources on things that make bigger impacts on our businesses fifth part is proposal for businesses in the kobe 19 era we have to compete on what our businesses are really about to nature our business what is the essence of foods you know that that would like be like for our survival we have to eat for survival but like eating at some restaurants makes people feel sick but like what if like you know we eat at these restaurants and then yeah we feel better what if we like people getting into better shapes by eating at these restaurants what's the access by dining out we build that it's an entertainment business we don't sell our products directly we have to develop a flow of mechanisms that people want to buy our products and then the last one is uh what's what's important is like never give up because that's the end of your business so um and so some of the some of the business concepts that like really really um being contemplating are like a little factory shop like small restaurants so basically we can do that production impression will be in front of the shop to promote homemade noodles in action foreign um i think some of our customers are doing like um like old running kits or something that was uh for on lightweight avoiding helping foods no chemicals in any additives organic gluten-free noodles yeah so this is uh what mr freeze like for this lecture um but like for um for those who like for you know like he was basically like interesting like not like finding out like what you are interested in learning so if um there are certain subjects that you are interested in um learning or like you know you need to know like from mr fuji um please uh send them in the comments or like um you know you guys can like send us emails uh or like send us send them through contact forms like on my website so we have some ingredients and this is a solid indians these are two so you have like flour for ramen noodles noodle is like around like with the protein when it like around 11 then this is the whole wheat powder whole wheat and these are the liquid indians so we have water we have autonzi and salt okay and so these are gonna be like gonna be liquid so let's uh start baking dough first [Music] so this mixer is machines for richmond one machine that um and so first uh it's got a mixer but it's a 10 kilograms mixer and that means like you can use after like 10 times solid like the minimum batch for this mixer is like four kilograms four kilograms so we are doing solid ingredients and then currently she's adding liquid equates about like 40 to the weight of flour so that means 4 times 0.4 so that's about like two kilograms of liquid so guys around like two-thirds of the water like liquid towards the mixer and as you can see the the mixer lid has the small holes this liquid is stripped and we added the flour a little by little to the flour so you know it's basically called good hydration of the flour and then um you know what we so she she put the dough in like plastic bag and place it at room temperature so that that's uh that's what we call like resting process and breast implants are very important to further develop the the cooking strategy inside though so it's very important and then what she's doing now is that like she's feeding the dough into the uh into a set of rollers the set of rollers and then you can you can actually adjust the roller gap between these rollers and so she's putting this dough through the uh like two meter first two millimeter and so that's the initial roller cap and so what we are getting is the sheet of dough that's that's that's two millimeter thickness so so we are heating the dough and we're getting the rough kind of silver rough sheet of dough that's two millimeter thickness and you want to go slow what about slowly like in this process because we want to apply like really good pressure the dough to um develop the improvement structure inside those so we want to go slow this process and as you can see that the the dough is like kind of like kind of crumbles after like after the after mixing and so this basic process like we call like rough foaming rough foaming so like we're just making a rough sheet of dough first and then uh and later like after that like we'll make um because it's still fragile we'll uh like put these uh like separate this uh dough into two separate sheets of a rough dough but like we're going to be combine combine them through the rollers again to make it form so beautiful is a combining process so combining process like stuff like mixing weighing and mixing make it all and like rock foaming and combining process so i have to complete those by using the process i mean what's important making though is that like you know to develop like really good instructions i built so that that's uh that's very good mixing resting rough forming and combining this is uh these are basically [Music] and combining them by introducing separate sheets to one through the rollers so that was like 2 millimeter thickness that was too many medium thickness right and that's like we are combining these two separate sheets of dough that's 2 mm thickness so basically um that door that's going to the walls is like basically four because like two millimeter plus two millimeter four millimeter and uh so for me riddle the noise but it went through to the going to the rollers and um and he she set the roller gap to three millimeters because we um you want to pin it within it uh clean it but like you know you don't want to paint it like drastically because like if you do that like if you just sit or if you sit there sit there all the way up like for example like two unit or something um that that's kind of damaged inside so we want to gradually finish and gradual cleaning and to do that like we will apply this like simple rule of infinity percent so now it's like three millimeter uh raw gap the dough is going through and and the next step is to again right and so three plus three six six times seventy percent point four point uh four point two per meter i like to make it simple like we run it down to 4.2 millimeter so the door is now going through the volume of 4 millimeters and from this point off because this is a pretty sticky dough so we want to keep it from going from sticking so we'll start dusting on this one this machine has automatic duster that he actually adjusts the volume doesn't itself so the better the more you have so after the second floor process um the door the glue instructing the door is like completely developed so all we have to do is pin it in the dough to the final thickness and from this point on you can go faster you go faster so and now we're going to roll the opposite to the new millimeter and the next next round we set the roller gap to two millimeter three times point seven two point four but round it maybe simple so now it's going for two millimeter rolling down and next round before we cut it we should measure the actual thickness of the dough and then that's like 2.6 millimeter so there's a difference of 0.6 millimeter between the actual thickness and the roller gap she said and so to set the roller gap to get the final thickness so the final thickness pr that is 2.2 millimeter so we set the roller gap to 1.6 mm so that when it's thinned the roller gap of 1.6 millimeter we can expect the actual thickness though to expand back by 0.6 because the difference between them the actual thing is roll the gap is now like 0.6 so it's at the back up to 1.6 and this is the kind of kind of we use you call like sleep dog runner and each groove is 2.5 millimeter width so the width of the determined by the cutter size for the thickness of the mango is coming by the roller yeah she's all right so let's start cutter and the dipping noodle is giving you like thickness and because the dipping noodle is usually the typing size is pretty big 150 grams in fresh noodles which video how the subscribe channel so that's how you make noodles like from scratch um so we're going to move to the kitchen where uh mysteries will share these special vegan noodle dishes for takeout and before we before we move to the kitchen uh you know we want to want to say that um yeah we so we've been

the same kitchen tokyo office and mr fujii and we are very very lucky to have him today to teach us some of his special little dishes and uh so thank you yeah thank you thank you attending our trust this time today i want to show you two different types of vegan ramen uh this diamond i selected especially for european market so materials i use this time is red paprika one uh massaman material is red paprika and another is a japanese miso and korean uh so japanese and korean mixture so anyway uh today uh this month my company is uh having a anniversary of 45 years uh until i started this business so i started this business 45 years when i was 27 years old at first i manufactured noodle machines and i started noodle school 20 years ago so from now from now on i want to give you a lot of excellent know-how of our learning school our drama school uh future is no preservation no preservation we never we never use any preservation and any additives and no msg and our method of cooking is specialized by digital cooking because of uh before i was engineer so dessert cooking is very very uh easy to understand for you all but unfortunately now uh our singapore ramen school closed until february so and also we maybe we cannot open uh dummy school uh from now maybe our one hour or uh half of one hour i i'm not sure so uh this time we are now uh preparing e learning material for ramen school so maybe uh uh soon you can join our iranian we want to soon we want to start iranian school as soon as possible okay anyway today three people they do they do our paper uh mother name is a japan name sometimes called dried noodle because there are no soup so this material is total japanese tofu so or soup base is made from dead paprika and two fruits apple and pineapple and another one is this one this is a hot hot food and this is a cold noodle and so this noodle we used roasted vegetables and those people are tofu and this another one is vegan miso masala tofu this is also tofu soy bean cake and all vegetables are fresh because this noodle is called noodle okay so let's start [Music] oh this is a material these materials all bigger no animal food no animal materials for instance this is a sweet chili and white miso and uh season the third careful seasoning meeting so concentrated meeting and soy sauce onion soy sauce okay soy sauce and kill food soy sauce motor daddy and this flavor oil deep flavor oil garlic flavor roasted onion flavor so this time we prepared all these materials and this is a dead paprika sauce made from this paprika this is a fresh one and oven and oven and peeled peel peel the skin so after opened unfilled skin we make this uh uh paprika's sauce by mix by mixing with this mixer so this time we use this paprika as salt and then paprika sauce and several moto dare and okay so let's try already measured so we use this paprika uh base 50 gram this time 50 grams and pineapple soup 25 gram apples juice soup for 25 and killed the stock 50 grams so that more already so this is a pineapple and apple and kelp all measured by uh this recipe so i mix with this at first pineapple and second apple third okay maybe this uh cup is too small to mix all together so i need a bigger one this this may be too big you don't have a medium one like this size okay okay this safe is very suitable so keep at the first kill and i mix all together mix with the pineapple and apple all together like this [Applause] so red papulka is a very popular material vegetable in european market so this time i prepared dead paprika oh [Applause] okay i mix all together all our soup bases and this sweet chili sweet chili 8 gram and the next ah mixed vinegar foam ground our skin vinegar and next one salt onion one gram and next kelp third kelp 15 gram dry salt what i saw i use dry salt to make this uh sharp edge to the uh soup so this uh dried salt makes the soup very sharp teeth finally but we must use this salt not at first that last time because uh uh if we use this soap out of the first time salt makes become very mild but after the last time we if we use this thought we can feel very sharp edge and meeting uh heated meeting and this is a nuts paste we make nut paste by grinding okay so at first nuts is dried but after grinding that becomes like a so this nut paste makes the teeth very deep so only vegetable materials it's rather difficult to make the taste deep but adding this nuts mixture we can make taste very deep and next time sesame paste sesame paste also makes the taste very deep sesame paste six grams nuts are nut space also 6 gram this sesame paste also makes the taste very deep i'll do it next time heated onion soy sauce three rum and heated seed okay soy sauce london and finally heated our kirk soy sauce 3 gram so color becomes a little bit darker so last time i added a flavor oil the first time deep oil garlic oil 3 gram and roasted onion oil 2 grams and chili oil five grams of finished uh smells very nice smells very nice so now we started to go noodle so after uh i uh make presentation and already materials prepared this material from tofu soybeans soybean cakes that that this one so we cut london like this so in order to make a good program uh with youtube presentations we'd better cut any materials in random not uniformly it's very important factor to cut london roasted all roasted materials for that paprika masama look at this okay so this time i use this ball it doesn't oh oh bow and the shape is like this and the color white okay okay so i start presentation um paper paper today i boiled uh noodle this noodle cutter size is 14 cutter size and one hundred one hundred and sixty grams of noodle we boiled okay noodle prepared so next uh next time we use this top and you never uh like this this is uh cooked uniformly so uh this color and this color is quite different this is not you uniformly uh the very dark place and the white place mixed mixed so this looks uh beautiful more beautiful compared to this one okay so not uniformly random is very very important for best presentation so this uh cutting also random so for protein we use a soy sauce no tofu hmm okay next time i use so colorful dead paprika and red cut fabric also cut in a random shape so red and green are green chili and then paprika so this combination makes this presentation better and better and this green is uh zucchini is also very familiar materials for european people massive finally i use a light dig and it's better to make rather high green animal so finally i use this paprika and they do think paper so i finished so okay the first one i finished so uh i tried next one next one is vegan miso mazama stock [Music] [Applause] okay i start at first i mix miso and cotherjang together i divide it into two this is miso on the kids now this white miso is not only a simple white miso but also this white miso is a white miso motor dary so this motor that contains a lot of materials uh like uh uh four different types of uh white miso and uh uh ginger and apple many and many other materials white miso and kids next time and the kids the first time i made this miso or vegan miso massimen i made this menu two years ago in singapore ramen school i cleaned this vegan muslin for the lady student from abu dhabi boys [Music] yes i'd better use this one for mixing [Music] okay it becomes better so next time uh cd uh red chili sweet sweet chili tin gram and salt here two grams next sesame paste sesame paste 8 gram so okay and mix nut paste 15 grams so okay hey next ah soy sauce is and sea turkey heated two gram and heated kelp two gram finally spray butter oil white leek 2 gram garlic 3 gram roasted onion 2 gram chili oil finish a good flavor very good flavor okay so next time i used i tried to use this container instead of a bowl because nowadays take away and delivery a fruit is very very popular and also we recommend you to make this kind of uh delivering food because after corona many customers lifestyle and a sense of thinking changes so they want to sometimes many times they want to go out to restaurant but instead of going to restaurants they want to stay at home until they want to eat inside of home so this is this kind of contouring is very very useful for take away okay i thought now our noodles are so noodle already boiled so oh i put this noodle inside of the bowl ah sorry i i'd better at first mix this noodle mix with this sauce after after mix i use container okay i make this noodle a flat in the box presentation before presentation i cut materials this is also up on the top and this time also i do not cut uniformly like this instead of is uniformly i try to cut like this i cut this stuff dug a chicken breast time i use dry so so okay so next time i use italian pistol chicory ah this what's good i must use this one avocado i'm good it's curry if i use curry i cut curry like this i used this different and also i can use zucchini slice to the chili hmm okay finally i want to use crescent uh and pink pepper okay finish looks very delicious maybe you can enjoy this menu by yourself if you cannot make this one anytime

use your need some quick oats I recommend quick notes rather than old fashion because these are going to soak up liquid a lot easier and they're just easier to work with whenhe egg whites coconut flour stevia some baking powder some pure vanilla extract and of course sprinkles very first thing we need to do is pre-heat your oven on 350 degrees Fahrenheit next thing you need to do is take 40 grams of your oats add them to a microwave safe Bowl now I'm going to add water to Seoul as you can see you add water and you can see there's about an inch of water on top of the ghosts now we're going to add this for the microwave or night watch this while it's cooking because it's gonna ride the beautiful Costa microwave you know that over time it'll want to rise and go over the edge she's going to watch it so depending on how powerful your microwave is like the last 15 seconds and my immersion story over so I need to stop early tell your coats are now done cooking you can see they're soaked up a lot of the water as 46 grams to grams so now I have my dry ingredients I've already mixed them together that's my protein powder that's my stevia that's my coconut flour and that's my base it's gonna add about half and I came so there it is it's her batter [Music] and then we could be to get baby but I gotta leave song Nara and these two alright so now we're gonna cook these up for about eight to ten minutes watch them but you're going to know they're ready is wherever you touch the top and it's not liquid anymore there's a little bit of roundness so now we're gonna make our protein spirit to ski crossing that we're gonna put on top of these cupcakes gonna need some PD science gourmet vanilla protein coconut flour and stevia some vanilla extract and of course some sprinkles I've water and mix to this [Music] this is the consistency we're working with put this in the freezer old activates the coconut flour it's kind of picking up more and more months cuz we be

challenge let's go hi everyone my name is Rita and welcome to the 51st day of my challenge which actually is the two of my recreations of the previously skipped recipes because apparently I am on a treasure hunt mode because I could find these ingredients which I couldn't find for a long time and that happened totally by chance I went to my one of my favorite bakery shops here and while browsing like seriously like in the movie I noticed in the very corner of one shop but like really think movie like like so okay there were no spider webs but they might as well been there so I noticed many fellow cops and I would like yes I can try mini baklava so that's what I'm gonna try today but before getting into the ingredients I want to mention one little thing this recipe calls for some toasted almonds and toasted walnuts yes and toasted anything is kind too complicated of a thing right here so what I did and this is actually a good tip if you are in a similar situation like me and cannot find toasted anything or maybe you like making everything homemade so what I did well okay first the Google and then I've turned on my oven to preheat to 180 degrees I've layered all of my nuts on a baking sheet which a lined with parchment paper and I made sure that the nuts are in one even layer and I've toasted them for 10 minutes during this time I stirred a couple of times to ensure even browning but that's that and now my home smells so nice so now let's go over the ingredients and let's get started we're gonna need 12 mini fellow cops 30 grams of toasted walnuts 40 grams of toasted almonds two tablespoons of sugar divided into 1 and 1 tablespoon half a tablespoon of melted butter just a quarter of a small orange war of a teaspoon of cinnamon eighth of a teaspoon of salt eighth of a teaspoon of vanilla extract 2 tablespoons of water and 1 tablespoon of honey I'm gonna actually skip the first step lorises to do because okay first what it is it's to pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees and toast your mini phyllo cups for around five minutes and the reason why I kinda I'm afraid to do that is because i'm not using the exact same fellow cups Lori uses and mine are much well they look at least much lighter and airier and i'm a bit afraid that in total baking time I'm just gonna burn them so I'm gonna proceed to the next step which is making the filling and I'm gonna do in the same way Laura did so i have my food processor ready with a blade attachment and now let's see trying not to peek at the ingredients because I can see them there I'm gonna add to the nuts the one tablespoon of sugar the butter the salt cinnamon and the orange zest okay and I'm gonna pulse until I get coarse crumbs if you have a mini cupcake tin you should place your mini fellow cups into that but as I don't have one I figured I'm just gonna use my normal cupcake tent so I'm gonna place them here and then I'm gonna fill them up with around one and a half teaspoon of this awesome smelling filling in and now into the oven for 10 minutes in the meantime let's make the syrup so I'm going to take all of the remaining ingredients water sugar vanilla extract and the honey I'm gonna add them to this pan it's not a saucepan but oh and on medium heat I'm gonna bring to a boil once boiling I'm gonna reduce the heat to medium-low and I'm going to simmer for another 5 minutes ok and now i'm going to let it go for two minutes transfert my syrup into this little glass thingy so that it would be easier to scoop with them spoon but I have really little of it left what I should do now I should take it t 1 t spoon and pour all over every single baklava and then they're actually should be left enough for a second round but it's really very little so I took a half teaspoon and I've no praying that it's enough because I think I'm gonna have to make some more the yeah so I definitely need some more of the serps so let's take it ok so here we go again I've decided to make a double of what I just did so I have quarter of a cup or 60 milliliters of water 2 tablespoons of sugar 2 tablespoons of honey and a quarter of a teaspoon of vanilla extract and I'm gonna do the exact same thing bring to a boil and then simmer for 5 minutes ok and now i'm going to let it rest again for two minutes now it looks like it might be enough ok so i've put for these half a teaspoon so I'm gonna put another half a teaspoon I'm gonna put one teaspoon and then make a second round of one teaspoon it should be two teaspoons in toto okay and now the second round and the reason why you make first one teaspoon and then again the second one you give them time not them but you give the syrup time to kind of sink in and set a little bit it was a triple portion for a half of portion of mini baklava and I will still still have a couple of them okay one will be toned to the left alone I'll be sure to update the ingredients so now I'm going to let them cool down here on the counter for 30 minutes and then I'm gonna put them to the fridge for two hours you when you're waiting for so long I know forget what you were doing in the first place but now two hours of past I've taken them out from the fridge and I'm really curious to try it because before coming to run I did live in Turkey for three years and I'm no stranger to baklava so okay from just looking at it it looks nothing like but lava but maybe the taste will be similar I don't know but it does look tasty okay come little one but they look you I like many things okay hmm okay they're really tasty this is like a nutty therapy I don't even know how to describe it make look at it it's a nutty therapy dessert and of course if my fellow cops were a bit nicer looking they would look even fancier but well except for the nuts I don't really feel any resemblance to the real baklava but it's really good anyways oh I was really curious about this one and the orange zest as nice at it as it is like this statistic feel to it but you don't really feel it in baklava and it does look totally different than these ones so this is a really nice dessert it's well it's easy to make if you have guests you can make really a lot you just have to make a little bit in advance because they do need to kind of cool down so that the syrup would settle in but yeah I don't know I'm like I'm no thinking no this is this mob baklava oh well so but this is a nice dessert I really like it especially if I if I could find nicer fellow cups they would look like quite a fancy dessert which I think everyone would probably think I bought from somewhere because it does look kind of fancy but anyways oh and by by the way about the syrup i just remembered it was so long ago i feel like i did need to make a triple in total portion of the syrup to have enough of it to for all over the fellow cups so okay if you know what lava this is not that but it's a really nice dessert which I would really recommend trying so if you want you can go the original recipe by Laura and the written one is in the description box I will update this syrupy part or at least i will put some note there and i really hope you had fun and i'll see you in the day bye", "z6kCTDW8PL8": "hey thanks for stopping by I appreciate a lot of support and you know I appreciate you so if you haven't subscribed yet feel free to hit the notification bell so today we're

the Paris conference and as you all know of course that conference was successful in leading to the adoption of the Paris agreement what I'm going to be talking about now is moving ahead now two and a half years where are we in the climate change process what has happened with the Paris agreement where its prospects going forward now i robert asked me to start with a overview of my book which michelle just mentioned and as she said there are flyers over in the back if you're interested in it so i'm going to start with an overview of the book just very very briefly then talk about the future of the paris agreement and then at the end focus a little bit on the situation in the united states so to begin with that books of the book is a general introduction to international climate change law that title is very descriptive not very exciting but descriptive it tries to provide a broad overview to specialists and non-specialists alike i try to give them a one-stop shopping for trying to understand international climate change law the focus of the book is on the UN climate change regime the progression of instruments has been adopted under that regime starting with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change than the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 the Copenhagen Accord and then most recently the Paris agreement so the book focuses primarily on the legal instruments in the UN climate change regime but it's also much broader it tries to locate climate change law within public international law more generally so there are several chapters on general public international law and how it relates to climate change it also looks at efforts beyond the UN Framework Convention process in forums like the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization and then it also looks at the intersection of climate change law with other areas in international law so let me just briefly talk about the book give you a little bit of an overview on it so there are three different perspectives on climate change and I think they're all reflected in the UN climate regime what is an environmental perspective the UN climate change regime has adopted an environmental goal of limiting temperature increased well under two degrees centigrade with looking at the possibility of going to 1.5 degrees centigrade as a temperature goal going forward the means of achieving that environmental goal under the Framework Convention and the subsequent instruments is to peak emissions as soon as possible to have rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to have carbon neutrality in the second half of the twentieth of 21st century those are the goals the emissions goals under the Paris agreement so one perspective of course is an environmental perspective on the climate change issue a second perspective is an economic perspective an economic perspective where as an economist economists would say you want to maximize benefits are relative to costs the means of achieving that economic goal would be cost effective policies a lot of emphasis and the climate change regime as you probably know on the use of market-based mechanisms such as emissions trading looking not just to carbon dioxide been looking comprehensively across all gases sources and sinks of greenhouse gases so their countries can choose where to reduce in the most cost-effective manner possible and then finally there's an ethical perspective where the goal is to equitably distribute effort and costs and the means as done in the climate change regime thus far is by having some some system of differentiated obligations between States to try to reflect equity and were recently to focus on the issue of loss and damages for damages caused by climate change now the history of the climate change regime is very briefly I'm sure you're all familiar I call it a plan for acts where the first act was the adoption of the Framework Convention which established a system of governance second the Kyoto Protocol legally binding targets a third act was Copenhagen which moved in a direction where bottom-up direction excuse me where bottom-up direction and then the final act is said where the current act hopefully not a final act is the Paris agreement so we try to understand this progression of instruments in terms of three recurring themes that run through all of these different instruments one is the issue of legal binding this is the to what degree is the regime legally binding a second is the the architecture of the regime to what extent is it try to impose norms from the top down through international negotiations to what extent is that allow countries to define what they're doing through of some kind of bottom-up nationally determined process and the third is differentiation how uniform is the system how differentiation is differentiated is it as between different states so if you start with the Framework Convention it's a treaty in terms of its legal binding this but not all of its provisions are binding it's largely a bottom up regime where countries get to define their own national climate policies and in terms of differentiation it's mixed it established the annex system dividing countries up into different annexes developed developing and countries so we see B countries that have financial obligations but then it also has common obligations that run across all countries Kyoto Protocol moves in one direction quite strongly in the direction of legal binding this the targets under Kyoto or binding top-down direction the targets that were adopted in Kyoto Protocol were internationally negotiated and allied with that binding US and top-down a very bifurcated approach that binding top-down system applied to developed countries but not developing countries with the Paris agreement we see a move back more in the direction of the Framework Convention again it is a treaty unlike open Hague and it's a treaty but not all the provisions are binding it's largely bottom-up the commitments are naturally determined that there's a set of international rules to try to bound that national discretion I'll be talking more about that because that's a lot of what the Paris negotiations rulebook negotiations are about and then it takes a very tailored or nuanced approach to differentiation it goes moves away from the annex system that the framework convention established it still though has by for bifurcated financial commitments developed countries on the one hand developing countries on the other but in terms of the mitigation commitments the commitments to reduce emissions those are not bifurcated those are essentially uniform for all countries so we try to understand this evolution in the regime from the Framework Convention to Kyoto to Paris through the lens of these three different variables we also look as I said at efforts beyond the UNF Triple C they're larger what's called a regime complex so it's what's going on in international organizations like IMO and ICAO and the Montreal Protocol we also look at the multi-level features of the regime it's not just at the multilateral levels it's also a regional initiative national initiative sub-national initiatives and I'll come back to that a little bit when I talk about the United States later in my talk it's also polycentric there's no sort of hierarchical system of authority there all sorts of different interconnections between different levels and there's also multi actors so it's no longer simply States it's also of course business NGOs civil society more broadly so the climate efforts beyond the UN F Triple C it's a very complicated picture with a lot of different stuff going on it goes well beyond with the UN Framework Convention regime does and then finally we look at intersections with other areas of international law in the book so we picked three there are a lot of other ones you could focus on we look at migration refugee law because climate change is expected to produce a large-scale displacement of people so how does international law address that what is the climate change regime say about that if anything how do those two different regimes the refugee migration regime and the climate change regime relate to one another we also look at the intersection between climate change law and human rights law because climate change will both affect the enjoyment of human rights like the right to food the right to housing the right to life itself in some cases also the response to climate change mitigation measures raised human rights concerns growing lots of trees monoculture trees place people and have human rights implication so we look at the intersection between climate change law and human rights law and then finally we look at the intersection between the climate regime and trade law which may be a subject we've discussed it more in the Q&A later but of course climate change measures raise all sorts of trade issues some of the measures that are talked about to deal with climate change things like border tax adjustments would raise serious issues under the WTO so we discussed some of those issues in that chapter of the book so that's to give you a broad overview of the book if you are interested in climate change law more generally it's a tries to provide a broad introduction and really aimed at the general reader not at the highly specialized reader okay so let me turn now to the topic of today's talk the future of the Paris agreement and I want to take this in three parts so first of all talk a little bit about what the Paris paradigm is what was the basic essence of the Paris agreement what were the challenges coming out of Paris and then what are the challenges going forward so to begin with what is the Paris paradigm what was the structure that the Paris agreement established I talked a little bit about what that structure might look like two-and-a-half years ago when I was here before and now we have the Paris agreement so we can see what came out of Paris and I think there are three elements that I'd like to highlight and what I call the Paris paradigm one is the hybrid structure of the regime the second is its procedural orientation and the third is the system by which it's trying to generate higher ambition over time what's sometimes called the cycle of contributions or the ratchet mechanisms so let me go through each of these three in turn so first of all the hybrid approach so we've seen in many international regimes including the climate change regime a choice between two different modes of operating one puts a lot of emphasis on national flexibility the other on where uniform international rules and different regimes reflect this more bottom-up verson more top-down element in different ways the idea of national flexibility is to promote participation where countries are you willing to participate the theory is if they have more flexibility in what they do it allows greater experimentation it's essentially a risk management tool for countries where they have more flexibility so there may be willing to take more risks and the idea is that a more bottom-up system can produce higher ambition because countries are willing to do more if they have more flexibility on the other hand you've got the more top-down approach where you focus on uniform international rules this has the strengths of promoting transparency and accountability it's also promoting a comparability it's easier to compare what countries are doing when it's more uniform it also promotes reciprocity countries can make trade-offs where one country needs to do X in return for other countries agreeing to do y so we've seen a back-and-forth in this in the evolution of the climate change regime where you started with the Framework Convention which is a very pretty bottom-up kind of regime focusing mostly on national policies pledging what's called pledging review then you move to Kyoto you know highly top-down regime with legally binding internationally negotiated targets and then you have Copenhagen as I said with more bottom-up pledges with very very few rules which promoted a kind of a Wild West as we say in the u.s. approach where countries just got to do whatever they chose and the idea of the Paris paradigm is sort of a Goldilocks solution along all three of the different elements that I mentioned earlier so in terms of its legality of sweet goal binding this it's naturally determined contributions I'm sorry in terms of its top-down versus bottom-up elements its nationally determined contributions so it's national flexibility countries got to decide what they're going to do their targets are not set by international negotiations they're decided by each country individual individually but with international rules unlike Kyoto unlike the Copenhagen Accord the theory is with stronger international rules term about transparency and accountability I'll come in a minute in terms of binding us it's a treaty but not all of the provisions are binding so it says splitting the difference in terms of its legality and then with differentiation as I said before it's also trying to take a more hybrid approach it has differentiation nationally determined contributions reflect self differentiation each country gets to decide what it wants to do on its own whether to take a target do policies and measures and so forth it abandons the annex structure but it still has bifurcation of financial commitments so it tries to take along all three of the different elements I mentioned something of a hybrid approach to try to promote participation and it's got amazing levels of participation and I'll come back to in a minute that the u.s. is still participating at least for the next few years but trying to balance those efforts to get more participation with having a strong system of rules to promote transparency and accountability now those rules that are trying to promote transparency and accountability are largely procedural rules so this is the second element of the Paris paradigm it's largely a procedural agreement the nationally determined contributions are not legally binding the commitments are all of a procedural nature so what do countries have to do they have to communicate an MDC every five years a nationally determined contributions they have to provide information upfront ex ante about what the nature of their contribution is so it's transparent it's clear it's understandable otherwise you don't even know what the countries have said they're gonna do so they have provided enough information so that it's understandable what they say they're gonna do they're supposed to report by Annalee biennially on progress towards achievement of their NDC it's not a legal requirement that they achieved their NDC but they have to provide the information so you know have they done are they doing what they say they're gonna do they have to participate in several different processes review a technical expert review a peer review was called the facilitate of multilateral consideration of progress it is essentially a peer review system state to state and then they're supposed to there's a global stocktake to assess progress and then countries are supposed to come back and revise their NDC in light of the global stocktake and the idea of all this is to make clear what countries say they're gonna do make sure you know whether they're actually achieving it so you can hold their feet to the fire and try to put pressure on them to achieve what they say they're gonna do and that's to promote accountability and then to try to promote ambition through the system of five year cycles where every five years is a global stocktake see how the world is doing and then the presumption is the global stocktake will show that there's more as needed and that will then put pressure on state in the next round to come back with stronger contributions and so this third part of the Paris paradigm is what what is usually referred to as the cycle or country of contributions or the ratchet mechanism and so this is just showing the different steps the principles behind this ratchet mechanism are in the Paris agreement itself they're supposed to be a series of progression each successive nationally determined contributions is supposed to be progress from the previous one that's the idea of the ratchet sort of one way moving up in terms of higher ambition that's on the bottom left there the principles and then there's your nationally determined contributions supposed to reflect the highest possible ambition so those are the general principles guiding this process the cycle of contributions but then you move from having your national contribution with the information necessary to promote clarity transparency and understanding then you have the process of national implementation reporting back on what you're doing so countries can assess whether you're not you've actually done what you say you're going to do this process first of individual review where each country's individually reviewed by technical experts by their peers by other countries then a collective review the global stock take and then your next round of NDC's that are supposed to reflect high as possible ambition and progression so that is those three elements I think are the core of the ideas behind Paris splitting the difference in all these very difficult issues of legality bottom-up top-down and differentiation that's the hybrid approach a largely procedural approach and then this cycle of contributions to try to get stronger ambition over time so there were three challenges though coming out of Paris three challenges which I want you just highlight and that I think are behind sort of some of the current difficulties which I'll discuss in a minute first of all the NDC's are insufficiently ambitious as Michelle mentioned there is what's called the emissions gap second the model of course may not work this whole idea that if you have a cycle of contribution that will put sufficient political pressure on States so that they will in fact ratchet up their ambition over time we don't know yet whether that's going to work or not whether in the next round of NDC's countries will and back come back and have more ambitious nationally determined contributions and then the next cycle they'll have you been more ambitious so we don't know that's a it's a theory it's plausible but it's at this point still I would say unproven and then the third is is this compromise of stable was there really a meeting of the minds in Paris agreement on this new paradigm or not so let me just briefly discuss each of those three so the first is the emissions cap that of course is the overarching environmental problem with the agreement the agreement doesn't do and everybody agrees with on this doesn't do enough the goal of the Paris agreement is to limit temperature to well below two degrees not even just two degrees well below two degrees with the idea of examining the possibility of going to 1.5 degrees so this is showing what the emissions pathways are up to 2030 which is where Paris covers up to 2030 the range of sort of emission scenarios that would keep us within two degrees and within one and a half degrees temperature increase these are the baseline cases with no actions the current policy trajectory with existing national policies and then this is showing the projected increases in emissions with what's called the unconditional on the conditional NDC cases the unconditional is what states have said they're going to do I'm conditionally without any support the conditional cases what states say they're going to do if they did get financials or this is for developing country so the unconditional case higher levels of emissions the conditional case of what countries would do if they got full support for it is shown with with the green here so even the best case though the conditional NDC case so this is what states said they're going to do if they get support and they get the support so they do all the pollen this is with full achievement of NDC so these are of course questions you know will countries actually achieve your indices but this is assuming everybody said does exactly what they say they're going to do full compliance you're still more in the range of three degrees or more rather than two degrees let alone one and a half degrees and so there's a gap even in the best case of about eleven million eleven gigatonnes of emissions that has to be closed if we're going to in fact move from the current pathway or the Paris and conditional pathway to the two degree pathway and of course you'd have to do even more we're like sixteen gigatons emission reduction gap if you want to get on to a one point five degree emissions temperature change scenario okay so that's the challenge of the gap the emissions gap and the idea of Paris is to try to over time close that gap improve performance so that we're on a better trajectory through the cycle of contributions but of course there's the question with a cycle of contributions in fact work so the first cycle of contributions takes a twenty twenty and then their five-year cycle is done 22 2020 to 2025 and then 2025 to 2030 and then just going forward over time and so you have the global stock taking each of these and then the new round of NDC's which in theory is supposed to be pushing upward so we're now in the midst of the first cycle and there's going to be the first of these global stock takes except it's not called a global stock take called a facilitative dialogue it's happening this year it's happening this year it's been named the Talon OA dialogue because Fiji has the presidency of the conference of the parties and telomeres have got the process traditional process in Fijian society of discussion sharing stories so that first round of the tell no dialogue happened last Sunday we could go Sunday and it's essentially it's a sharing of stories is what it is it's a sharing of stories where so countries spend a day and also non-governmental actors spent a day sharing stories about challenges they have successes they've had and so forth this is not what would call a rigorous process of examination but it's it's more a idea of trying to build some sense of I'd say community some sense of shared understandings there's going to be the final phase of the tell no dialogue in December at the conference of the parties and Poland and then it's still unclear exactly what the outputs of the facilitated dialogue the tell no dialogue is going to be but presumably some kind of conclusions by the presidency possibly some kind of report now one thing that's unclear is whether the Tallinn OA dialogue is going to be the same the global stocktake will be the same as the Talon OA dialogue there have different terms used facilitated dialogue is what we're in now the first global stocktake will be in 2023 so obviously though the cella no dialogue is going to be a precedent for the global stocktake but whether the global stocktake will be the same as it is unclear they're going to be two more inputs for the Tallinn OA dialogue that are going to be key I think one is the IPCC's one point five degree report which is going to be coming out in October of this year so shortly before the Bonn conference or the sorry the Poland conference so what the IPCC was asked to do was to examine achievement what would it would it take to achieve the 1.5 degree temperature goal there have been graphs of the IPCC report that had been elite of course the final report hasn't been finished but I think as everybody expected what the IPCC is going to say is reaching 1.5 degrees it's virtually impossible but what would take to reach 1.5 g there's going to be overshoot of the 1.5 target and then to get to it one would have to have negative emissions would have to have large-scale removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which would then bring the temperature back down to 1.5 degrees this is likely to require some kind of and what its originally referred to as climate engineering techniques to try to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a very large scale and so that of course raises its own set of problems but we don't know yet of course what the IPCC final report is going to say we just know what they're sort of thinking about saying so far in the drafts which are still under review another input for the Talon for the itala no dialogue is the California summit which also talked a little bit about at the end of my talk today which is a conference being held organized in California to try to bring leaders together from government from industry from the civil society to try to have yet commitments to stronger ambition and then that products of the California summit will be fed into the towel no dialogue so this is the idea we'll see of course in 2020 whether countries in fact come forward with stronger NDC's so I would say unclear at this point but I think there's a serious cause for question as to whether or not there it actually will be this ratchet up over time of the contribution the countries are making and then the third challenge is is Paris paradigm stable was there really a meeting of the minds Paris I think moved to a significant degree in the direction of the developed country vision of what the climate change regime should look like a stronger emphasis on mitigation than I have patient or finance the cycle of contributions I've talked about really applies primarily to mitigation and a big big question one of the things that really is the most controversial in the Paris rulebook negotiations is whether you should have a similar cycle of contributions for finance as you have for munication because the mitigation cycle of contributions is considerably stronger than what the Paris agreement provides in terms of finance so so it moves in the developing country direction in terms of focus on mitigation more than on adaptation and finance and in favor and towards the developed country view on differentiation because there's no bifurcation of the basic mitigation commitments in the Paris agreement there's so a lot of was I think Michelle referred to as constructive ambiguity this is a because whether it's constructive or not I guess there's a subject to reader subject to different views but the idea of constructive ambiguity is you need to have ambiguity because there's in fact not a meeting of the minds so you need to have something ambiguity so that everybody can declare victory interpret the provisions in the way they want and then go home and say they've done something but of course that then just refers the issues until later the issues don't go away because there was in fact no real resolution of the issues there was a formulation that can be subject to differing interpretations so there is some constructive ambiguity in the Paris agreement which developing countries really focus on because they are trying to I would say move the Paris paradigm back from the way I've characterized it here in a direction that has more bifurcation and it has more focus on finance and adaptation not only on mitigation okay so where are we now we're now in the process of elaborating the Paris rulebook this is just listing a whole series of different issues and I'm not going to go through all of these but just to sort of I have a listing here of the different issues that are in the Paris negotiations lots of different issues where the Paris agreement establishes some general rule but then how you operationalize that's going to require a lot more so you're supposed to do accounting of your of your emissions in terms of whether you've achieved your NDC but exactly how that works it remains to be determined i if it's going to be set at the international level they're marking mechanisms but there are no rules for how those market mechanisms will work at the moment so a lot of different issues we are the Paris agreement sets some general rule that at a pretty high of generality where the idea is to try to flesh it the rule-out give it more precision through the negotiation of what I call modalities MPGs modalities procedures and guidelines which will spell these rules out so the problem in the rulebook negotiation is the issues I've mentioned before where Paris tries to get a Goldilocks solution - there's still issues they haven't gone away and so the three issues I highlighted throughout the talk today legal binding the stuff down Bruce's bottom up and differentiation they're all still huge issues in the Paris oral book negotiations it's not the Paris of solve them so the Paris agreement has the procedural obligations being binding legally binding it authorizes the conference of the parties to adopt legally binding rules fleshing out there these the provisions so the personal book could be legally binding in most cases but will it be legally binding a lot of countries don't like the idea that they're going to have legally binding rules applying to what they report on applying to how that's reviewed how the accounting system works so there's a big issue as to whether or not the paris rules will say shall or should or may may is simply optional you know you may do it it's just a luster to him but whether you do it or not is up to you should is at least pushing in the direction that you should be doing it and shall would be the language of legal obligation so in every paris rulebook negotiation you know room there's an issue that's mostly been bracketed so far but it's going to be an issue they're going to have to resolve at the end about what level of legal binding this the paris rules will have um how much should the paris rulebook how detail should it be how much you try to really define what the accounting rules are what the reporting rules are or how much did you left basically for countries to decide how they're going to do their own reporting how they're going to do their own accounting so this is the same top-down versus bottom-up issue how much will countries get to naturally determine about how they implement the paris procedural obligations how much will be under nationally defined and then finally on differentiation same issue we'll the Paris rules apply to countries the same all countries will they apply to developing countries different from developed countries will there be different rules different rules for what the developed countries have to do in terms of reporting and accounting transparency and what developing countries have to do so the issue of differentiation which Paris seemed to represent a sort of a step change and how it's been addressed we're right back where we were before in some ways as pre Paris so these rules issues haven't gone away I said after Paris you know the questions going to be did Paris really resolve the issue so we can now move to a more technical discussion or will it still be a political discussion and I think the Paris rulebook negotiations pretty strongly demonstrate that we're still in a political discussion we haven't moved to simply a technical discussion about how you implement Paris um so there's a lot of challenges in completing the Paris agreement work program the Paris rulebook there's the political issues what some see is an attempt to renegotiate Paris by having different having a lot of differentiation by not having much legal binding this by shifting the focus or having a lot more in finance and had a patient and the Paris agreement specifically provides for it there's a lot of issue linkage so developing countries are very concerned that there's not enough attention to finance so the question is do you hold up progress and every other issue until finance moves ahead or adaptation moves ahead so there's a lot of issue linkage is very hard to get progress in any group uh-huh because virtually everybody's unhappy with progress in some other groups so then you hold up progress in the groups that you don't care about as much to try to get more progress in the groups that you do care about there's a lot of technical complexity so it's not just a political problem that's also a technical problem without you know how you elaborate the accounting rules how you elaborate the reporting rules I think there's the these people have been negotiating a long time that they spend most of their time just making the same statements over and over again so there's not even very good understanding I think among a lot of the negotiators about the technical issues that they're trying to resolve and there's simply a procedural mechanical problem the parish rulebook supposed to be wrapped up in Katowice Poland in December that's only a six seven months away there's only going to be one more round of negotiations between now and Katowice they have a hundred sixty five page document coming out of the bomb meeting hundred sixty one has there's not even in the form of a decision not even a legal format just as a big mess of different elements and you know with very little weeding out so it's not even clear what the structure of the terrorists decisions going to look like so just they only have two more weeks of negotiations to try to go through 165 pages and convert this big amalgam of stuff into some text they can actually adopt in Katowice so there's a huge just just a question of time basically to get from where we are now to a rural book coming out of the Poland meeting in December okay so finally let me just say a few a little bit about the u.s. situation because I'd say situating these challenges I've mentioned before the problem that there's the gap the questions about the cycle of contributions the continuing political differences because parents really didn't resolve most of the issues in any kind of way that countries are totally satisfied with or at least some countries adding to all that of course is the u.s. situation where under your President Trump the u.s. is both rolling back policies at the international level as well as at the national level so let me talk about that because that really also is another thing I think that makes the whole negotiating process on the Paris rulebook more difficult um so I think it's may be useful to separate out what the Trump administration is doing internationally and what's happening domestically in the US so internationally I think the most immediate problem is the US has not going to make the second part of its contribution to the Green Climate Fund u.s. said it was going to contribute three billion dollars the Obama administration before it left office gave 1 billion of that there's still two billion left and the Trump administration has said they're not going to give the two billion dollars so that of course then has ripple effects throughout the process because developing countries are unhappy to begin with with the state of financial contribution so two billion dollars represents I think 20% of the overall funding in the first phase of contribution to the Green Climate Fund so it's a huge hit the Green Climate Fund is taking and this is an immediate effect because the u.s. is already you know this is happening right now so I think that makes the negotiations more difficult because developing countries are ready felt you know they're what they're supposed to be getting out of this process which is more financial contributions more financial support is being undermined by the u.s. decision not to fund the Green Climate Fund then there's the longer-term prospect of the u.s. withdrawing from the Paris agreement so the u.s. is not out of Paris at this point president Trump did not withdraw the u.s. from Paris he simply announced that the US would withdraw well the US would give its notice of withdrawal when the Paris agreement authorized it - that doesn't take place till 2019 that's the earliest you can give your notice of withdrawal you have to give one-year notice I mean withdrawal doesn't take effect till 2020 so unless something changes unless the Trump administration changes its of you the u.s. is going to be in Paris through 2020 and of course the US would only be out of Paris if in fact Trump follows through and does give notice of withdrawal it's more than a year away the Trump administration changes its policies on a weekly basis so whether in fact the Trump administration will withdraw from Paris in 2019 or not I think it's still an open question and the Trump administration has made some noises that it would be willing to stay in Paris you know I think that's a better deal so that's still I think after the Paris real bug negotiations are finished you know maybe there'll be some appetite to at least make some tweaks that would allow President Trump to declare victory and stay in Paris so unknown but of course he's made the announcement - that does have effects and I'd say the effects and the effects are really on how engaged the US what kind of leadership role can the u.s. play in the negotiations so in terms of the negotiation of the Paris rulebook u.s. now sends a much much smaller delegation it's still actively involved it's basically has exactly the same policies it's putting forward in the Paris real book negotiations that it had under the Obama administration because the basic approach of pushing for transparency pushing for market-based approaches hasn't changed that was a basically a bipartisan approach to the climate negotiation since the first Bush administration so that's stayed the same there's been no new instructions as far as I know but the u.s. is less involved so to the extent that you see the negotiations as sort of a back and forth the US doesn't play nearly as much of a counterweight to China and other developing countries as it did when it was more fully engaged pre Paris then there's the question of ambition and whether or not there's going to actually be the cyclo contributions will work so far there's been no sign of backtracking of the existing NDC's know countries haven't been withdrawing their existing naturally driven contributions but in the next round of NDC's aim graduating up first of all there's going to be no US push at all for stronger contributions since the US has a plan to make one to the extent there's reciprocity in the regime where countries are willing to do things in exchange for other countries if the US isn't going to do something that of course it's going to lower the likelihood that other countries will come forward with ambitious pledges I'd say the one bright spot on the horizon on the ambition issue is a lot of taking place at the state and local level and the US states and localities things like the California Simon are trying to highlight that as a way to show that you know it's not that the u.s. is doing nothing the u.s. is doing something maybe not at the federal level but at other levels hopefully as a way to reassure other countries that the US isn't completely derelict and trying to do something on the climate change issue the US Drug Administration though is also doing a lot domestically tried to rollback Obama administration regulations the clean power plan and the auto emission standards this is going to require new regulatory rulemaking so it's not the case these standards are out already these are again intentions to roll them back in the future it's going to be a little Boreas process to do new rules to replace the existing rules likely to be a lot of Court challenges so it's gonna take a long time before the existing rules are actually changed in the meantime though the Trump administration can basically not do much to implement the existing rule so even though the existing rules are in place and will be in place until they're succeeded by some other rule not as much as taking place on the implementation front to make those rules actually effective and then finally oh and and I'd say the biggest one here probably is the rollback of the auto emission standards which the Trump administration is it Out's because in the u.s. now transportation emissions are the largest source of emissions in the u.s. more than the power sector so the rollback in vehicle emission standards is huge in terms of trying to get the u.s. on to a better image in trajectory and then finally the you trouble administration is trying to limit what states are doing by withdrawing the waiver that allows California to have its own auto emission standards so not only is the Trump administration rolling back the federal standards it's also attempting to roll back state standards so there are a lot of non federal initiatives down to try to compensate for the Trump administration actions there's that we're still in coalition there's America's pledge there's the US climate alliance there's the global covenant of mayors so these are all actions at the non federal level at the state and local level also by business and civil society actors at the bottom conference I think the biggest pavilion of the Bonn conference was the u.s. pavilion when I got there and somebody said that's the u.s. pavilion which was huge I said how is the u.s. having a pavilion because the US administration doesn't believe in climate change well the u.s. pavilion was funded by Jerry Brown and Bloomberg and largely Bloomberg it was a non-federal pavilion of states and localities and business they put it though the Secretary to just thing putting it right next to the governmental part of the site rather than the non-governmental sector of the site so it was like an alternative government like an alternative world walking into the u.s. pavilion it was all BX US negotiators who've left and then a huge variety of other actors and I think that was part of the we're still on America's pledge combination so America's pledge covers non-federal actions and it represents a huge amount in terms of GDP and emissions so if the nut Worstell in America's pledge group were a country they'd be the third biggest economy in the world after the US and China bigger than Japan or Germany in terms of emissions they'd be fourth in terms of global emissions after China the US and India so we're talking about you know not to hold us obviously about half the US but still a huge actor to the extent is effective in reducing emissions there have been a lot of state actions to California's extended its emission reduction programs through twenty twenty thirty with I think a pledge of 50% reductions by 2050 New Jersey and Virginia are joining a regional greenhouse gas trading scheme where that's at least expected it hasn't happened yet some kinds of states are continue having subsidies to try to keep nuclear going and California and 16 other states are suing the EPA to blocked the weakened vehicle emission standards so the lots going on at the state level which is some counterweight at least to the lack of action at the federal level and then finally California summit which I mentioned it's going to be September 12th to 14th again that's largely Jerry Brown governor of California and Michael Bloomberg the ex mayor of New York and it's going to bring together say local leaders business scientists environmental groups and the idea is a call to action for stepped up ambition which will lead into the telco a dialog and then lead into the next set of NDC's which are going to be in 2020 so that's just an overview of sort of where we are internationally a little bit on where we are in the u.s. at least and how that affects the international process so thank you very much for your attention and happy to [Applause]", "waLUBI0og4M": "you you [Music] I am about to be making a healthy recipe and just kind of making it up as I go a lot of people ask me what my recipes are and my not but honestly I just pick out ingredients from the fridge and make things as I go so here we go we are going to make a healthy egg salad so stay tuned and enjoy this video so first of all we have the ingredients and I might add things as I go but I don't have mustard so I'm using this mustard seed we will see how this turns out we have some Greek yogurt for the base as well as light Miracle Whip and then of course your hard boiled eggs and instead of celery I have cucumbers and then we've got cilantro and green onion for some more spices and then shredded this is not supposed to be here get out of here I shred lettuce we're gonna add some no sugar added sweet relish and then pink Himalayan sea salt black peppercorn and oregano because I love oregano on like everything [Music] so one thing that I like to do on as I prepare my recipes as I will write on my whiteboard on the fridge how much I'm using of everything and then once I'm done I will make a recipe in My Fitness Pal and divide it by how many servings I'm having and there you have it it's as simple as that [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I think that the most important thing is to really break that the egg yolk which I should have done separately but I think it'd make it a lot easier and yeah just mix everything together it's looking good you can definitely add some spice if you want to I don't feel like any spice today but you can easily throw in some Tabasco sauce cayenne pepper red pepper flakes whatever you prefer for your choice of spice but I don't feel like any today I can always add it individually as I eat this on whatever I want to eat it on and you could eat this on toast you can on crackers you can just eat it by the spoonful whatever make sure a little heart happy but alright I think it's looking pretty good I think I do want to add a little bit of Spanish paprika if I can find mine stay tuned and I will show you guys the final product and do the taste test alright so I actually just found this ground mustard so I'm going to add a little bit of that to the bowl as well and stay tuned alright so I did find the paprika I'm going to actually add on top for the decoration but first we need to weigh it out and divide it by however many servings you're gonna have so I'm putting into another Bowl on the food scaler right now and then I will be able to determine how much I can have for serving and what the total macros are as you guys saw this recipe did not take very long at all it literally took me less than 10 minutes and my cleanup can be super easy as well so it does not take long to food prep I don't know why people struggle so bad with this set some time aside make it a priority and that's all you gotta do okay so we are weighing out to 432 431 grams so I'm gonna do all the math and I'll let you guys know all right so I just went ahead and made it into eight servings of forty or fifty four grams total so I put one serving on this wasa cracker sprinkled some paprika and let's go ahead and give it a try dang that is good that is so good it's a little bit tastes like the green onions um I believe if you added a little bit more egg yolk it would kind of tame it out a little bit but I really like it I like a little tangy zestiness to my food so I think goes awesome maybe add a little bit more pepper and/or salt and then whatever seasonings also you like to throw in but I will put the macker on the screen I hope you guys give that one a try if you are craving some sort of like egg salad low calorie protein type snack or meal whatever you wanna call it but anyways I will see you in the next recipe and thank you for watching so far dang this is good this is so good so I ended up dividing into eight servings of 54 grams total and put it on here I will go ahead and put it into my fitness pal in just a minute I'll put the markers in the screen for you but it's a little um maybe lacking mustard I I feel like the green onion I can't talk right now I feel like the green onion might overpower but I like green onion tankiness so if you added a little bit more mustard and maybe another egg yolk or two that might even it out a little bit such anyways I really like it I enjoy it I hope you guys give this one a try and I will see you in the next recipe [Music] this hey guys it is time time for another recipe for you first I started to share this ice cream pop with you this is actually the mint chocolate chip from Aldi and it's really good so if you can still find them they have this one and the salted caramel swirl super good very very macro friendly like less than 10 grams of carbs for this around 70 calories are so really good I highly recommend this and you can find my full review on dough fit chick on Instagram but today I wanted to share with you a recipe for donuts because we all love some donuts so I'm gonna make some protein donuts so stay tuned and I hope you enjoy it here is everything we need I'm using a cake pop protein powder for that glaze and then cinnamon crunch for the base I'm using quest protein and PE science and I have vanilla almond milk egg beaters one egg coconut flour and sugar replacement as well as some baking powder and pink Himalayan sea salt I'm also going to be using a maple extract and some unsweetened applesauce [Music] all right now to make each donut weigh the exact same I'm going to pour all of my batter into a fresh bowl so I can weigh it out I'm going to put the donut mold on my food scale and weigh it out perfectly so everything is 100% exactly the same and I can track it super easy [Music] all right doughnuts are in the oven so now I'm going to whisk together the topping the glaze so that's what I'm going to do next [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right now for the true test I'm going to try this out and I'll let you guys know what I think okay I am a legit shocked this tastes so good I'm so proud of myself and holy crap that's a really easy recipe it did not take me very long at all and you get a super macro friendly I'll have the macker on the screen Jonah don't mind my shaky mess and it's really like soft and not drama it's perfect literally perfect the perfect protein donut [Music] all right I have one last recipe to share with you so this is my individual portion of buffalo chicken it it is one my favorites I go and sprees I make this all the time and then I forget about it and so on obviously if you have a dairy allergy or intolerance this is not gonna be a good one for you but I promise it is worth it it is so good take those dairy tablets take whatever you need to do so stay tuned and I hope you guys enjoy this one and give it a try so I believe this is all the ingredients that we're gonna be working with some cream cheese Greek yogurt red hot buttermilk ranch packet and this one is nice with zero calories green onions and a fact I can chicken breast stuff is really not that bad I promise you we're gonna put some bacon pieces in there and some peppercorn and pink Himalayan sea salt now of course you can also add some cheese to it and get fat free cheese one-third reduced fat whatever you want that would be an awesome little touch to it but I feel like we have enough dairy going on right here so don't need to add that you [Music] we'll make believe kids [Music] so if I were going to be having some cheese this is also when I add without the cheese to it I'm going to mix this all up and then put it in the microwave you can put in the oven if you'd like but my group is much faster so I'm going to mix it up put in the microwave and then I will add in my salt pepper and my hot sauce to a my liking change up a little bit okay so to this because I really feel like we need a little bit of cheese so I'm gonna add this and make the final touches I will show you guys once it's ready [Music] so if you've never heard of smack nation it's actually a company that donates some of their proceeds to feeding America and it's a monthly subscription box so essentially you get a surprise box every single month with fun snacks like this one it is a campfire smores soft bake bar I'm so excited to try I've

school video which is a pirate chocolate cookie and this was the pilot episode uh part one of three um in april 2020 i uh we well we were all under house arrest uh with the global pandemic the lockdown had occurred and um sort of sat on the couch and reflecting and thinking about silo which is my zero waste restaurant and thinking you know we're doing a great job and it's making change in this way um and then thinking to myself what what's next you know what is next um and then thinking well you know silo is this kind of cutting-edge restaurant that um kind of inspires and instructs the hospitality industry but then i was thinking what could we do for the rest of the rest of the world um you know how can we affect the many rather than the few so yeah that was sort of why the zero waste cooking school um was born and uh yeah and uh this particular video was a little bit rough around the edges so please do uh excuse us um but yeah that's it that's the uh the end of this prelude now then douglas master reporting for the xero ways cooking school today we're going to be making pirate chocolate cookies here is a specimen of the pirate chocolate you may be wondering what i mean by pirate basically there's a bunch of dutch sailors that board the tresombres tresombres is 150 year old wooden ship or a brigantine and basically they sail organic cargo all around the world in this case the chocolate from the dominican republic is sailed all the way across the atlantic ocean with nothing but the wind and the waves so completely emission-free cargo i urge you to acquire this particular chocolate if you go to fairtransport.eu you can you can purchase it straight from the uh the tres umbras itself however if you don't want to use this particular chocolate any dark chocolate will work in the recipe this recipe is pretty bulletproof um you can't go too far wrong so yeah let's uh set sail and uh let's break some eggs once you've cracked your eggs take a big balloon whisk and basically just take the chocolate take your sword and chop it as small as you can get it just like that uh in the meanwhile um get a bun marie uh a bain marie is a pot of water there's just like an inch of water in there onto the heat a glass bowl do not use a plastic bowl otherwise it will melt put it on a medium heat and then we're basically just going to add the butter and the chocolate together into the glass bowl and melt it chuck your uh your butter right in there and then chocolate thyme try not to get it on the stove and then just take a wooden spoon give it a stir and then just stir every few minutes until it's completely molten and liquid so just to draw your attention to this coconut sugar so coconut sugar it's only a small fraction of our total sugar and you'll notice that in the recipe but it does bring a lot of um much more depth and character to the overall taste of the the cookie and we're using a desiccated coconut for this cookie that basically means that we can avoid using flour which means it is friendly to those with a gluten intolerance so it's a totally gluten-free pirate chocolate cookie yeah [Music] i haven't thought about the fact they were flowerless yeah yeah this is eggs sugar coconut and chocolate egg sugar coconut chocolate goddamn really yeah [Music] okay uh take a moment to talk about zero waste and so we've got to this stage now where we've put our chocolate mixture into some bowls i've bowled it into three different bowls so it cools down quicker and then i can take it out throughout the week in different batches so we have nice fresh cookies every single day top tip beeswax wrap uh we don't use cling film um because it's the devil's work um so instead we have this amazing beeswax wrap so yeah all you do is just lay it over the bowl and then you just wrap it it's got this incredible grip um making it airtight and yeah that is it [Music] now to portion the um cookies we're just gonna portion three um so we take our bees wax uh cling film off and we just grab a lump of the chocolate on to the scales 59.3 roll it in some of the excess desiccated coconut and then onto our tray so now um we've got this beautiful uh selection of three pirate chocolate cookies what i'm gonna do this is a super duper top tip roll them into a bowl like that and then pop this into the fridge for half an hour 20 minutes is fine actually depending on how cold your fridge is and basically what that's going to do is mean that when it bakes the center of this bowl is particularly cold so as it's baking the edges get really crispy and the middle will stay gooey and molten which just makes for a fantastic eating experience okay so now it's time to bake the cookies let's take them out the fridge so all we're going to do is take a little tiny pinch of salt on each one that's it that is good to bake so we're going to pop it in 180 for 12 minutes exactly the oven is telling us that our cookies are ready [Music] there we go amazing just anywhere this is uh ryan ryan's going to be uh taste testing this pirate chocolate cookie this is a job i'm okay with yeah so yeah nice and crispy on the outside and it should be well super molten on the inside that's worked out so it's not too sweet it's like the salt creates an amazing sort of yeah sweet and savory balance but it's just not too sweet and it's got that kind of tropical note to it as well like richness to the chocolate but it's like chewy and sweet yeah yeah i'm happy with that and that's it that's the end of this transmission [Music] you", "zfnp90pFVPE": "Hello everyone I am Maomao Today we will make coffee hazelnut soft European Bread Compared with the spinach soft Europe Bread in the previous video This dough has a higher moisture content So I will share some more details of kneading the dough in the video Some details of fermentation Then let's start making it while we talking there is a Poolish dough that we need to make one day in advance To make it, take 150 grams of flour, add 1.5 grams or one gram of yeast and 150 grams of water Their weight ratio is one to one Use hand whisk or chopsticks to stir into a ball Then ferment at room temperature until there are bubbles on the surface Put it in the refrigerator for another 12 hours and use it Because they are using the same Poolish preferment dough So you can refer to the video of the previous Spinach soft bread to see the detailed steps specially how to tell the right status of fermentation about when at which state that can be put in the refrigerator. The previous video has a very very detailed introduction. And the last video also talked about a lot of bread preferment dough Old dough Poolish Biga  as well as the difference between these So please refer to the previous video Now we need to make this wine sinked cranberry one day in advance or two or three days in advance Cranberry Cranberry Raspberry comes with sweet and sour flavor It is especially suitable to be added to the European bread that has less oil and sugar to improve the flavor Next a few hours before making the bread We can add hot water to instant coffee to make a very concentrated coffee You can also use the coffee you drink at home Or use water instead Add coffee here Is to increase the flavor of the bread Because after all, it has less oil and less sugar So we need to improve its flavor After we prepare the raw materials To chop this hazelnut Hazelnuts are added to this bread is also to increase its flavor We started to knead the dough First of all Take out this Poolish preferment from fridge Weigh 300 grams into the mixing bowl  Then add 350 grams of high-gluten flour The whole recipe is actually 500 grams of flour Then add salt and sugar yeast Yeast shouldn\u2019t be put together with salt. Then this coffee brewed with hot water before  It was put it in the refrigerator and has been cooled down Then add ice water to it Used to control the dough temperature I will leave about five or six grams of water right now Especially if it is the first time you do it Be sure to save a little water Then the video will explain at which step that that we should check to if it is necessary to add this saved water  Or even add a little more water First, we start the machine and set at low speed Give it a mixture of all the ingredients At this time, you must use a scraper to help the machine a little In this way, the entire kneading time can be shortened Especially some mixers don't work very smartly  when they mix at this low speed It takes a long time to mix together You must help the machine at this time Let's take a look at the state at this time after mixing up a little How the dough looks like at this time It looks like the water has been sucked in Not particularly dry But actually what I want to say is The state at this time is not the state you use to judge whether to use the remaining water or add extra water. Because at this time the flour and water their hydration reaction has not yet fully started We need to increase speed It takes about one minute or two minutes of kneading that the flou and water fully combine and gluten begins to form a little feel that every flour particle has been in contact with water At this time, use your hands to knead the dough To feel the softness and hardness of this dough And then decide whether to add water We have been kneading for about two or three minutes now Let's take a look at the current dough Although his surface is not very smooth But it's obviously a little bit more ball looking than before this is the time that you need to judge whether to add additional water or not. Pinch with both hands You can feel it is soft And it's already stuck on your hand slightly That means you don\u2019t add water at all This state is just right If it's not sticky at all Then you may actually add a little more water to increase the softness my mixer kneaded for about nine and a half minutes Counts the low-speed mixing before So it\u2019s about seven minutes of kneading at the middle and high speed then le't check the dough It's very smooth I usually use the smoothness of the surface to judge if ready to add butter We cut a small piece with scissors The side is very smooth and uniform The membrane will be a little thick Then the dough is quite gluten Jagged around the hole  Now you can add butter Butter must be thoroughly softened If your butter is not softened, it will be difficult to blend it into this dough It will cause extra time of kneading And it can't be mixed well with the dough Anyway, the butter must be softened After adding butter We want to mixing at low speed Let the butter and the dough mixed together first Do not knead at high speed at this time In this case Because the butter is too slippery If the speed is too fast, it won\u2019t be able to knead where it is slippery In this case, the whole dough cannot be kneaded evenly So the gluten of the whole dough is different Be patient at this time Because this step may take two to three minutes To knead the butter in Make sure you do not see the butter particles left Then start to increase the speed slightly Start to knead again Basically mixing for two or three minutes after adding butter After three minutes you probabaly need to check the gluten status every half or a minute Don't over knead it Especially when making loaf toast don't over knead it When over knead, the membrane is pretty good But actually you have over knead the dough already Then your toast won't grow tall enough Here want to share with you a little trick I used often When the butter is kind of integrated after adding the butter You will find that the dough sticks to this hook You can cut it piece by piece with scissors It is equivalent to helping the machine to blend the butter with the dough evenly Anyway, it\u2019s the same principle Just don\u2019t rely on the machine completely You must help it to shorten the kneading time How to make it more efficient Then like this to fully knead the butter in  to the dough  mix them together faster At this time you can increase the speed a little bit Let butter and dough Continue to blend evenly It\u2019s 13 minutes now and minus the previous nine minutes Actually, after adding this butter, I knead it for about two or three minutes. So please be very patient at this step Let the butter slowly blend with the dough Don't be impatient Then you can increase to high speed, medium and high speed to start kneading i didn't give a fixed speed setting becasue each machine is different So please use the mixing speed in the video as reference to set your mixer speed Then we kneaded for about three minutes Let's check the membrane The efficiency of my machine is quite high Basically it takes three minutes We also cut a small piece with scissors Or use your hand to pinch a small piece down Pull and turn 90 degrees Pull again Gluten The membrane at this time is obviously much thinner than before And the poaked hole edge is very smooth My whole process took 15 minutes in total that counts the start mixing at low speed, the whole process from the beginning Until the end is 15 minutes There is another way to check if  the gluten of the dough is enough Take a piece of dough Then pull with both hands like this You have to feel that it must be very resilient if it become long right after you pull it Then the gluten is over knead  the gluten strands need to be strong With your hands pulling like this As you stretch little  It will be slightly longer Pull it up and make it a bit longer It is very gluten If you want a window pane test You can take a larger piece of dough And then slowly put it on your hand I personally think that the window pane is not so important Sometimes you blindly pursue the thin membrane You knead the dough too much Many chefs who make bread  uses his hands to stretch the dough to feel the gluten to know the right gluten strongness It seems that the more amateurs like us all use window pane membranes to judge whether it is good or not Anyway, everyone must know This dough must have strong gluten Don't over knead it This is the chopped hazelnut we added Give it a whirl for ten seconds Just leave the hazelnuts in it Measure the temperature it was 24 c degrees (75.2F) So I put it in the oven for first rise It takes about an hour for the dough to twice the size Put in the oven It has better insulation effect We needto take it out and turn it over after half an hour Fold the sides towards the middle  Just turn it over Why need to turn it over Because this dough has a higher moisture content Turn it over to release part of the carbon dioxide The whole dough will ferment more evenly The bottom dough has been lying underneath Turning it over will definitely helps the rise process The criteris we use is based on the volume Rise to twice the size Because using the method of poking a hole You can't see the big difference if you poke holes in such a soft dough So based on the volume Rise to twice the size Cut into third small doughs Sprinkle a little dry flour on the board Take a piece of dough Press with your hand to exhaust some air out Put some cranberries The cranberries were not added when kneading before is because its color will make the color of the dough not particularly attractive So we wrap it in at this moment We fold the dough like this , first push it forward then pull this back again Shape it into a circle Then tighten the the bottom slightly A feature of soft Europe bread is the bid size Here we can go straight to the second rise Why skip rounding, rest after dividing that we usually need to make bread? Because we don\u2019t need stuffing here And it's a round shape It's a round bread Then why do we usually need to make it ball and rest before second rise? Because after you divide into small dough After you round You messed  the gluten a little You need to relax to let it loose Let the gluten to relax  Then you can reshape it or add the stuffing Then go to the second rise Here we don\u2019t need to creat any shape but a ball and I don\u2019t need stuffing So  can skip the shape to a ball and  relaxation step So even though the usual 8 steps to make bread include kneading, firsr rise Split Rounding relaxation shaping Second rise but If you are makign bread like this don\u2019t need filling or special shaping at all You can completely skip the steps of  Rounding Resting these two parts Two doughs are baked in rattan baskets Baking europe bread  in a bread proofing baskets is particularly beautiful We need to sprinkle a layer of flour before use This can make the bread come out with the kind of spiral track with the kind of surface texture.  very beautiful We put the dough like this bottom up put the top down If there is no bread proofing baskets, there is no problem at all We also do the same  add cranberries Fold like you folding the quilt inside like this Round it Put on a baking tray let it do the second rise in your favorite container as for the second rise The condition is 35 degrees and 75% humidity If there is no fermentation oven at home You can add 1 cup of hot water to increase humidity Until it's twice as big  it took me for about an hour today We take the bread out of the bread proofing baskets and put upside down on this baking tray This bread proofing baskets created  The lines on this surface are particularly beautiful Before baking in the oven We need to cut it top We simply cut a cross shape It can also be cut into a lot of very beautiful shapes. that looks nice There is a small tips After you cut once Take a look at how big the cut can be If it's not very big You just need to cut again Make sure to cut a little bit deeper It will look better after baking We bake it for 25 minutes to 30 minutes at a temperature of about 350 degrees Baked to the surface is the color The color is very even This kind of bread is very easy to judge when it s done. Because his color change is particularly obvious The surface of the freshly baked bread is very crispy Then our coffee hazelnut soft Europe bread is ready A cup of chrysanthemum tea with the bread in a leisurely afternoon  a truly relaxing  Please remember to adjust the water amount to adjust the dough  based on your flour type  Then remember to turn it over when it's half fermented If there is no humidity, you can add a cup of hot water to increase the humidity Because humidity is  important for soft Europe Bread It would be better if you have an oven at home that can spray steam Here is the bread making video that i want to share here I am Maomao Maomao who loves to baking Subscribe to my channel if you like my video See you next time Bye bye"}
