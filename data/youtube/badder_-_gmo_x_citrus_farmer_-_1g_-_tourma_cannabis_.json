{"8k3O_aPPrvs": "Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to open and toke some but from ki relief see what we got citrus farmer 21 percent THC um interesting story about this order I didn't know exactly what I was ordering all I saw was CFA 21 percent and I was like well 21 percent sounds good no idea what CFA means but let's go with it so here I am citrus farmer just gotta put it on a camera cuz somebody need to know now let's see how is this seal these sometimes okay yeah it looks I think it was intact yep I just popped that but see I mean you know that did pop really easy those plastic ones you really got to try to pop them so surely switcher I don't know if these are cheaper or what but just switch go back go to the other ones like everybody else uses this right here use these these work really well and they don't pop right off they're also not hard to get off so what we got here this is the first one I mean even in the stuff I began from truly everything's popcorn lately so let's see this I mean this isn't huge buds but you know it's a little bit better than then not huge buzz I mean a little bit better than small those tiny popcorn see what we've got oh wait oh man I smell that okay so I was about to pour it out on the plate and I the smell hit me that is so citrusy this is the sit most citrusy strain I have ever smelled I mean I've had well ok ok mandarin orange is all about the citrusy smells but it's a little tamer of a citrusy smell is a little milder just like mandarin oranges are in real life and what i mean is this is a much more intense citrusy like maybe grapefruit but it's also got something else in there almost like a mommy smell with it it's like citrus umami or maybe maybe it's a little it's a really strong citrus with a little bit of that funk that like cush lemon og cush and stuff oh look at that bud look at that bud right there it's like a beautiful Christmas tree yes this is what I like nice buds all right let's see wow this is cool I like this batch so far let's take a look at it oh it's sticking to my finger yeah okay that's very nice oh-ho look at it yeah it's so nice this guy loves crystal oh it smells unique this is just beautiful man I love it when I get a new strain that smells different from other strains and get to dive in and enjoy it I think since this one is so different this might be the one that I vape yep it smells very different although that predator Peter by something f2 I forget that was really really nice smelling to this one and you know citrus strains aren't usually like I don't usually like go gaga over citrus strains I like them but this much smells really good see if we can get this zoom in there we go so as you can see there's a little bit of sugar leaf edge on it on that one but overall I mean this is some nice these are dank buds that's the tank right there all right I'm gonna have you a savage and do that squish test oh wow it just squishes it just squishes oh yes you know you've got good weed when it just squishes it doesn't break it just squishes all right so let's get this thing vaped up that's what we need to do I'm gonna see I think I'll cut this up to be raped I usually for convenience when I vape I'll use the grinder and it works really well but I just want to be you know as impartial as possible and get his full and experience of this as I can because once you put it into that weed grinder it is going to lose a lot of stuff on the inside of it and in this way if you lose it it's right there on the plate and you can just scrape it right up and put it in your bowl anyway so it doesn't matter if it falls off and you can just pull it off the edge of the scissors there you go even better it would be if you had a shot glass put it in there just inside the shot glass with your scissors alright get this turned on - 18 650 s in there he's been using the concentrate mode lately a lot it's 500 degrees as opposed to a 428 at the top of the flower mode and I just I like it because first of all it doesn't degrade the flavor you know it takes a while for these kind of contraptions to heat up fully they heat up fast but really you know that's just the element in order to heat up all the in order to heat up the bowl and you know the metal here and everything else that surrounds that cannabis in there you know it takes a couple hits or a few hits but anyway this just gets through the bowl a lot faster I mean you know you can sit there and milk it on a low heat for a long time and that's great for if you want to just sit there and have the flavor for a while but sometimes like when you're making a video you just want to get some hits out of it little bit of vapor in there oh man it's like wow it's like I just vape the peel of a grapefruit but without all the bitterness just like a sweetness to it sweet citrusy flavor it really has that ruby red grapefruit flavor to it I really like that this is definitely going to be a strain that I have to keep in my rotation I'm a big sucker for flavor when it comes to weed and different smells you know the scents and all that kind of stuff and you know I will even have I would prefer a wide selection with overall lower averages of THD then I would having the highest THC strain but it's always the same strain you know I just like variety a lot and I think that actually when you switch it up it helps you get a little bit more medicated than if you just stick with the same strain I think maybe you get so caught a fatigue cannabinoid fatigue or your body does you know cannabinoid fatigue or terpene fatigue I don't know what else is in there Flav owns whatever could affect you and you know you switch it up and all of a sudden it's like you know if you've been doing the same exercise over and over and you try it a little bit different one day well it's gonna get you a little bit better workout man oh man it's giving off a lot of vapor hope you can see that mm-hmm this is one of the this would be a beautiful morning vapor I mean I'm serious man wake up in the morning have a cup of coffee maybe a you know an egg and some toast or something like that vape this stuff first though I mean before you have that egg and tell us you better bake this because then you're gonna get your appetite going oh man Wow definitely gonna have to come back and do some revisiting all these strains with this vape because this flavor is in tents on this citrus farmer this by a third review today and or you know open and toke well I like to call it cuz you know I really can't give a full review until man I gotta say this is beautiful I would recommend this to a friend in a heartbeat if you got a medical card and you are looking for some tasty relief it's gonna have like a clarifying type scent and feel to it this is the one right here I gotta say cure leaf um you know I think I saw it a little bit with the Sour Diesel or the strawberry diesel sorry excuse me so a little bit with this strawberry diesel you got a ways to go with like you care you know to where it's gonna be cured perfectly and not under cured or anything you know you got a little to work on with it being not being so dry on some of your things on some of your batches you ever work on it being a little bit danker than it is you know but you have these strains where you continuously knock it out of the park like la woman man that was a beautiful eight that is the best eight that I ever got was my last eighth of LA woman probably because I take that back okay super Silver Haze yeah I forget about that one that was the dankest but but la woman man it was up there it wasn't white is dank is the super fast Silver Haze but as far as flavor goes oh it was my favorite and effects were insane I mean let me tell you man I pressed one of those buds to LA woman buds and I immediately it came out this beautiful yellowish ivory creamy crumbly butter and I go and do a dab of it on my dad rig and let me tell you that hit me harder probably than any dad I've had in months I mean it was a good one let me tell you that so look it's getting some swirly vapes in there well I'll get kind of Medicaid guys and I think I gave you a good idea about this drain this is definitely a winner I will buy this over and over again if I can as long as they have sales because I don't like paying forty seven dollars for an eighth that is too much but as long as you can keep me in some sales kee relief I will come back if you can get that around the thirty five dollar mark this is worth it for sure now if you go higher that's up to you personal opinion kind of thing but this is some good stuff right here alright so you look at that look at those orange hairs man against the green is just so nice all right well that's an eighth of citrus farmer Cara leaf it is twenty one percent forty seven dollars retail price which is too high with discounts I was able to get it down to thirty to fifty which is just right I mean I go over to it I'm not trying to say you can't but uh yeah I'm really pleased thumbs up with some good stuff right there thank you very much Curie if you did a great banging job on this one I'll see you guys next time and thank you for watching", "z_zzynDIvNo": "all right today let's check out some citrus farmer 19.7 percent cure relief never tried this strain before supposed to be like an you know uh sativa dominant hybrid uh i don't really have fingernails so i don't know how to get the [ __ ] thing off [Music] oh [Music] oh i'm getting a citrusy smell for sure it's got that that classic tangy smell the buds feel nice and dense not overly dry weighs just on it's always nice when they at least weigh thanks a lot", "eT3VMsibJ5A": "i know that they want to do all the [ __ ] i've been doing but they cannot do it i went through my city my gang rolling with me no time to stop what's good youtube it's your favorite we vaping sky walking youtuber ganja vape here once again with a brand new video but for all my continued followers fans supporters and no subscribers with that notification bell turned on right down over there y'all already knew that what's up everybody hope y'all having a blessed day great day fantastic day a golden day today got some more flour not from true leaf but from cure leaf and it goes by the name of citra delic no i'm sorry citrus farmer and it is a hybrid sporting a thc percentage of sixteen point seven percent and a cbd of zero point one percent in this batch so i ain't really gonna get to talking too much more let's just bust this bad boy open oh man jesus christ that smells like every type of citrus you can imagine oranges lemons i guess a little bit of mango in there mandarins oh everything is in there dude let me swap on over so i can even get a closer look at it all right there's the joint there everyone and i wanted to show you all how nicely it breaks down cure cure leaves bud breaks down so good and fine especially with my uh diamond tooth grinder but what i also wanted to show you was the first bud that i managed to get out of the pack and it just looks like a pineapple grenade i love it so much ah bud check look at the hairs on and everything oh look at that crystals and all beautiful beautiful beautiful stuff pure leaf beautiful stuff cheers hope you're blazing with me also when i was rolling this up it really smelled like uh just citrus all the way through and now i can taste it too it tastes like a lemon airhead a lemon lemon head okay i got a new flavor a new taste off of that not really citrusy but different i gotta say honestly i'm a little bit blown away no pun intended i'm actually surprised at how much this is hitting me [Music] so after about three minutes of smoking on this my analysis would have to be and say that i will give this a six this is most definitely a very good quality smoke i just feel like it might be missing some lemon tree crumble or lemon og uh true wax or the syringe either one you could just manage to squeeze that off in here somehow i am sure it'll really make this blunt spark but as far as the taste consistency and everything it tastes like lemon and other citrus fruits like oranges it has that aroma all the way through it doesn't hit too hard it's actually about a three out of five on the harshness scale it actually has kind of a little aftertaste like i just ate a lemon head which is pretty [ __ ] dope i like that so yeah i give it a six i honestly recommend you go out and get you some citrus farmer from curie a very very decent smoke let me know how it affected you what kind of tastes and smell you got off of it and what you think about it as far as how i feel i really do get a hybrid feeling off of this little mix of indica and sativa both half and half doesn't really feel like a 30 70 or a 60 40 type deal it really feels like it's evenly cut down the middle 50 sativa 50 in the about wraps up my review for the citrus

Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I've got some citrus farmer 21 percent THC sativa dominant hybrid cannabis flower from Kara leaf this is actually about three months old at this point what happened is I ordered from Kara leaf back about three months ago I got two eighths of this and some other stuff on sale and this citrus farmer is one of the best strains I've had ever it's really really yummy and the big thing to me was how pungent the aroma was how covered it was in trichomes and how it had a unique citrus flavor to it it's not just a lemon or an orange like I'm used to getting you know whenever I get a citrus strain this has a distinct or at least it did had a distinct grapefruit aroma to it which I really really liked it was like a sweet like a candied ruby red grapefruit flavor I mean just really yummy you can see just how bold over I was in my review of it now here's the deal I might kind of you know disappointed that kirilov never really has much in stock lately and it's always gonna be 47 dollars because they they haven't really had many flower sales that I've found so I figured you know good time to pop this old favorite open you know during a care leaf drought right so let's see how it is easy enough to open the lid now here is cure leaves disappointing seals they have these styrofoam seals but this one looks like it is intact I don't see where it has pulled away even at three months old but will it does this actually block all the air we'll see if it has dried out what have we got inside looks like some decent-sized buds in there a couple smalls and decent ones let's take a smell there it is it's that beautiful you know what it has changed a little bit it's still got a lot of the grapefruit to it but now it's got a little bit of a savory aroma to man it's still really pungent let's take a look at it so as you can see we got some nice big old buds in here the buds are not the densest buds it does say this is a sativa dominant hybrid so it could have something to do with it as you can see this stuff is really nice it's got a lot of trichomes on it I think this is the same batch that I reviewed before I'm not quite sure it's a little bit of leaf enos on this one right here all right let's get some close-ups all right let's get it close to these suckers ha let's get a view of these suckers up close how about that you can see that one's got some sugar leaves on it they're pretty well coated look at that oh man that one is just furry nice well coated in trichomes not the densest buds but the smell is outrageous that's why I kept this 8th for so long I figured I might as well busted out now because I haven't gotten anything good from Keira leaf since this unfortunately I think I'm pretty sure actually perhaps I got I did get a little bit more from them not too long ago Sour Diesel and something else all right let's get a little bit closer I know let's go in twice as close and see what we got look at that man there's just so many trichomes on these things looks beautiful and if you think this is nice you don't know the half of it because the smell look you can see that they're like kind of amber in color I wonder if that means they've got a little more CBD in our CBN and them now look at that coating would you look at it would you look at it I mean would you just look at it nice that book is pretty dank so hopefully you guys can see why I got so excited over that strain at least part of it and the other part it's delicious delicious aroma of just sugary sweet ruby red grapefruit flavor all right let's get some of this stuff Wade and toked let's get it all Wade and some of it talked now that we got them smexy close up so let's get this stuff weighed in to see if we got our money's worth out of it never gotten anything underweight from Cara leaf so I'm pretty sure it'll work out but always check just to make sure no what-what tarnation there we go got it tear it out 3.6 so we got the weight that's awesome and I just wanted to let you know that citrus farmer is a sativa dominant hybrid blend and it's a cross between tangerine skunk and Grandpa's breath now I have to say grandpa's breath sounds disgusting I don't think I would like the smell of that string but citrus farmer smells amazing like I said candide ruby red grapefruit really good so I want to get some of this stuff vaped up because it's been a while so let me do the blood test on here when I get a smaller bud because I really like these things I don't want to don't I heard a beautiful bud alright so there's the bud it's a nice moisture level maybe tiny on the dry side but no it's it's decent like it doesn't crumble apart it's nice and supple when you squeeze it and you know these buds are actually a little denser than they look so there's that that's a good plus definitely not on the level of Starkiller or white buffalo man those are some dense buds right there white Buffalo's ridiculously dense at least the batch I got anyway only had it once man if you guys could smell this I mean it's so strong like it's just like we need fume vision so you can see all the fumes coming off of this stuff it just it would look like a smokestack probably Sookie relief what's going on how come you never have any selection I mean you got to get that flower rolled out so there's always something available you know I want to review all kinds of weed you know not just from the closest dispensary I've got but you guys never have any available for delivery or well what happens is you only have Afghani for delivery and you know 47 bucks for the same strain over and over again that's just not tickle in my pickle you know and another thing is you gotta have some sales have some flower sales now and then so that I can take advantage of them and you know show your product off to the world I mean that's what I'm here for right to review this stuff see how it is and you have some decent stuff so don't be afraid get that get that flower over here we want song alright so yeah hope we're hearing about I'll cure leaf opening here soon and the Panhandle I need another one alright between the two they're here already I think I'm going to go with a bag this time because I really want hey I might do two I might do a bag and then just a little bit in here to get the flavor of it and that should do it put this sucker together I have to clean these bags and all the glass pieces and I forgot the changer again be right back all righty i-i'll say that a changer can come in handy for sure but when you have to go get it every time because you forget it not as handy so here we go get that sucker John and I got another tip for making sure you get the thick paper in the bags let it heat up like this oh I didn't use my other except to put it to sixty let me go ahead and do that well you let it heat up like this let's change your roll kick in there we go and turn off the fan and just suck out this vapour that's not as dense that way you heat up the bud of the chamber and you clear out the bud that's not so dense make room for really dense I mean the vapor that's not so dense make room for really dense paper oh man the flavor is ridiculous holy cow I'm have to do that more often just sip that first one don't forget to turn it back down you will bust your bowl I mean you know combust you will combust your bowl and it speaks believe me not the best way to enjoy it I must say I'm gonna put this up just a tiny bit as you can see we got some vapor nice dense vapor coming in it's got to push its way this is all stuck together from all the trichomes and stuff I'm gonna go ahead and pack a little bit of this the easy way there's only just a little bit here man just inhaling this stuff to get it into the bowl the flavor is insane I want some more of this ki relief when are you gonna have some more citrus farmer and when are you gonna have a sale on flower it's Thanksgiving almost mmm perhaps you could have a sale oh man weak battery that's not cool switch out the battery on the starter let it heat up again this is some good stuff guys one of my favorites for sure Oh in the vapor the sweetness just comes out like crazy I'm getting really light vapor hits but they're full of flavor [Music] ma'am holy cow that's something special right there all right I love you I saw but truly it has changed their ordering so that now well not they're ordering they've changed their delivery program so that now they're gonna have mixed up delivery days or something like that but they'll announce as soon as the delivery arrives at your local truly they're gonna text but you have to sign up for it so I think that's a huge improvement because last time I went in there it was really stupid like they were like oh we can't tell you anything hehe what I mean are you trying to sell anything here or what you know that's what I was thinking so that's a good step in the right direction now it's Friday and I'm hoping that they have a delivery today cuz you know I haven't gotten a text yet but I guess we'll see nice paying a favor here oh this is so strong really feeling it you know I think it really decent sativa kind of effects you know that that's that kind of a strain in the medical system is a little bit more of a rarity like it's not necessarily hard to find a strain that's gonna leave you feeling like kind of cloudy headed and you know really really relaxed or whatever but it is harder to find a clear-headed strain I think so I really like it when I do find them and citrus farmers one white buffalo is another one let's see Jack Herer is a really good one [Music] and I really like um what is that strain Eponine ivory is a really good string too from three voice bar unfortunately I have a lot of seeds in it when I got it and my last order off to show you all the seeds I'm getting I got so many ideas for videos but I mean my main my main concern is getting out reviews I feel like it keeps pressure on the dispensaries seeing their products critiqued on a regular basis you know and treated like a product not treated like just a hobby or a game you know I mean they have a product out there and and we're patients and it's medicine and we need it to be a good quality product so I really believe in that I believe that as patients we're the ones who are going to bring the quality up in this state by demanding better so the more educated the more well-versed we are as consumers I hate that word the more educated and the will verse we are as citizens and patients you know the better we can be at buying our medicine the better we can be at encouraging the market to do better so you know it's all a process that we're going through here and we'll get through it it will not be long I guarantee you will have that really good high grade stuff a lot faster than California ended up like they are right now because you know you got to think about it they've been around for about 20 years now they've been in the medical game so yeah we're doing pretty well I'd say when we can get strains like this the white buffalo you know when we get these nice strains there's other ones too I don't mean to just name two TVs but that's what's on my head right now but excuse me but when we when you see these nice strains coming out okay look it's a little leafy it could use a little bit better trim job but it is very very nice this is good quality bud right here if I could ever get it to yeah there you go this is really good quality but I mean just look at all the trichomes on it so I'd say we're definitely improving and we just got to keep the pressure on them you know all right so bag one is down and I'm feeling really nice it's again it's not a groggy kind of strain at all I feel really clear-headed but also very well medicated a little bit of this now what I want over here in the Panhandle there's some rise dispensaries some move dispensaries a grill healthy a one plant once we get even if we just get two more dispensaries with these and flower that'll change everything up over here man the flavor oh gosh okay the flavor is better at this vape really concentrated and delicious I think the right word for how much better than I think the right word is intense this is it's a more intense flavor out of this baby which I really love it's almost like taking a bite of the fruit not even joking it's really really flavorful see where this bowls are going browning in the middle and on this bag full of should say this bags got a lot more the toasty flavor to it look man this is so tasty all right that's bag number two I'm feeling pretty well medicated at this point you know I'm nice and clear-headed medicated effect great for a day time I'd say I know it was always that way for the last eight this stuff is delicious I hope that they come out with more of this soon I haven't seen it around um it's 47.8 so it's too expensive I believe I got this for the 20% discount or it may have been something like I had a 10% discount plus I took off a bunch of money in points I think that might have been what it was so yeah it's a forty seven dollars retail on with a 10% discount it's forty two thirty and with a 20 percent discount it's thirty seven dollars and sixty cents so the twenty percent discount if you hang on for they're really good strains like this 37 60 I mean it's not a bad deal it's not a great deal it's a decent deal well unfortunately I haven't seen any sale for flour on key relief in a while and usually they don't have a very good stock of it so you guys need to pick up your game and start pumping out that flour you know that's what everybody wants but their day that said that ever since they release a medical program like over half of all the patients are choosing flour smokeable flour instead of all the extracts and stuff and you know I have to say I get way better effects from the flour and rosin than I do from distillate and other stuff like that so come on guys bring it up bring up your game and it's free delivery I don't know if there's a minimum order or not but I ordered enough so it I don't pay anything yeah really good stuff citrus farmer 21 percent THC sativa dominant hybrid flower from Cara leaf stuff is really potent and it smells like candied ruby red grapefruit really delicious it's covered in trichomes makes some nice delicious flavorful vapor that'll get you where you want to go thank you guys for watching y'all have a good one", "h4jUXBaFDzg": "hey how's it going cannabis community welcome to cultivating with the cannabis cowboy i am the cannabis cowboy and this is strange spotlight and i am extremely excited today for two reasons one reason first and foremost is this bud i have not tried before um it is actually a mixture of two strains it's three strains actually but two of them i've never tried before um gmo cookies and i've never tried skittles and i know you might be saying to yourself who is this person that call themself a cultivator and a cannabis cowboy if they've never tried either of these two new strains well i'm not one to jump on a new strain train i'm a bit of a purist when it comes to my cannabis i go with what's tried and true but every once in a while i can be pushed into something i've never tried before especially cannabis and especially new strains of cannabis now i might have had a couple strains in the past that might have included skittles or maybe included cookies although i'm not really 100 sure so today's going to be a great test of that and the other reason is this my trichome cam we're not only going to be able to get a great bird's eye view of the cannabis that i've got from good chemistry and various dispensaries around the denver and lakewood area but we're also going to get a really really really really close-up look through this microscope to kind of check out some of the trichomes so i'm also going to sample it out as usual so uh let's go ahead and take a look real quick so like i said this is called uh these are gmo skittles and it is across with gmo cookies skittles and og kush now obviously old school and i have tried og kush and i love me some og kush there's no doubt about that but i've heard a lot of great things about cookies and i've heard a lot of great things about skittles now like i said i probably have tried cookies in one form or another but never skittles so i'm extremely excited about that so we're gonna go ahead and take a look at it real close as i said before i'm definitely gonna sample it out for you folks so let's get a really close up view real quick here as you can see they're sort of uh these nugs in particular are just cured and they look a little bit tighter than some of the nugs i've seen before from good chemistry um usually and i don't really know how to explain what i'm saying to you right now but these were obviously manicured to perfection i'm not seeing hardly any leaf on it whatsoever i'm not really seeing a whole lot of anything other than some beautiful bud um which is a quite a wonderful thing so let's take another quick look and let's get this one of these nugs real up close for you folks like we normally do so let me go ahead and unfocus this crazy face of mine so that we can get you a closer shot at some of this and there you go so that is gmo skittles or skittles if you will with the legalization of cannabis a lot of cannabis cultivators have used names that have already been used whether it be for candy and various other things gorilla glue things like that uh they've been sued or they've been asked to not use the names anymore so they have to change it by a letter or possibly abbreviate whatever the case may be but this is a close-up look of some gmo skills and we're going to actually drop this in the trichome cam right now and see exactly what we can look at from here so let's slide this nug right under the scope i might actually have to um get a little bit closer here but there we go we're getting a nice view and you can see already there's some gorgeous trichomes happening in this i'm going to get a little bit more of a focus on it there we go yeah that's looking beautiful first time using the trichome cam ladies and gentlemen so just bear with me but as you can see the buds pretty dry i can kind of poke out and you can see it's not it's and they're hard nugs too so the fact that they're so still very so coated with trichomes is an amazing thing um different areas of this butter going to give you obviously some different colors so i'm going to kind of go through that too i'm going to show you all the greens all the oranges the dark greens the reds that are in there it's just a really really nice bright colorful bud so the next thing that i have to do obviously is try it out right so let's uh let's break up a little nug and um throw it in a clean pipe obviously it's nice and clean it's got a little bit of a burn down there but i boiled it before this video so i could actually get a really really good sense of what the flavor is like as well as the effect um the effects usually hit me a lot faster than most people edibles hit me really quick too it might have something to do with my stomach issues but i digress oh this smells so good it does sort of give you a little bit of the cookie and candy smell that the names of these strains are sort of known for obviously so let's see what it tastes like the dry hit is really really good it definitely has a just sort of a little bit of a vaporous smell to it at first wow wow that's nice it's been a lot it's been a while since i've exhaled a good flavor or or i'm not sorry not a good flavor a very evident flavor it tasted like i sort of had um ice cream cake or like vanilla cake in my mouth as i was blowing that out so the flavor's really good i gotta hit it again the flavor is really good and it's pungent and it hit me wow i can see the on a couple of different videos i've said i'm not sure i'd be able to tell you the difference between a 17 thc and a 25 thc but i'm wrong um i feel like i can tell you right now that this is definitely a high thc just simply because of what it did to my throat in my head right away i'm getting a nice cooling sensation down my down the back of my neck right now and just a little bit of fog behind my eyes not quite darkening me or or putting a lot of heat behind behind my eyes or making me want to go to sleep just yet but then again i haven't smoked a full blunt or a joint of it so i can't really give you that comparison but i can tell you this it is delicious um if i smoked a joint of this by myself which i normally do you know take a joint to the head that's the way i roll um i feel like i would be really really really really high from this and not necessarily in the tired way it's a hybrid so what you're going to do is you're going to get a little bit of the indica from the og kush and i imagine the skittles is more of a sativa correct me if i'm wrong i should know this but like i said i haven't tried these strains before um but the just the flavor in general is really really good the bud scent the naked bud scent i call it is not something i've always i've smelled traditionally from good chemistry um so i'm i'm kind of wondering if this is uh actually from one of their grows or maybe if it was grown at another um another one of their grows i don't really know but it has a scent that's a little bit different than a lot of the uh cannabis i've got from good chemistry regardless it is an amazing strain i gotta tell you right now i feel like i just got a little bit of a jolt of energy um from smoking it which is definitely not that doesn't always happen with me it's usually the exact opposite i don't ever smoke to get motivated i'm a highly motivated person i have a lot of energy i normally smoke to try and level myself out so i don't talk talk talk the whole time kind of like i do on these videos anyway if you are in the denver area and you are looking for some amazing cannabis please check out good chemistry on south broadway it's been my home dispensary for at least 12 years maybe 13 i don't really know um they used to be called something else but it was the same uh grow so regardless um go in check them out tell them that cannabis cowboy sent you and if you have a chance check out some of these gmo skittles it is listed on their um on their website as well as their menu when you walk in a sort of um exotic strain or maybe there's another word for it i don't know but there's a list of the strains they always have and there's about two or three that they don't always have and this was on it so thank you so much good chemistry for letting me sample this i really really appreciate it and thank you guys for tuning in as always i've got a couple strained videos i'm going to put out here um in the next maybe two to three days and thank you so much for watching if you haven't done so already please like and subscribe to my youtube channel it's going to help me out a lot check me out on facebook cultivating with the cannabis cowboy check me out on instagram cultivating with cannabis cowboy and as always keep growing", "tASKdXManH8": "all right got a delivery this morning right before the rain some uh afghani flower um it's 17 you can just make it out uh these labels don't hold up to alcohol very well and uh i'm not big on concentrates but uh i you know occasionally pick up a little i got some crumble today citrus farmer 77 percent yeah check that out let's go ahead and open this up okay double sealed i'm getting a very good focus today that's all right [Music] a little bit dry they're afghani for whatever reason always comes a little dry but i like the effects in the evening so or on a rainy afternoon like today you know i'm not even gonna mess around i'm just going to tear it out with this these are kind of more or less minis i mean for 30 and 8 i can't complain though really especially with the free delivery no minimums sometimes on a week i don't have a ton of cash i can just buy you know 1 8. so definitely waze so that's good all right let's check this out i actually do like the paper that it comes in so the last one of these i got the actual lid came off the jar as soon as i picked it up and i almost spilled a bunch so you got to kind of pay attention to that but all right that looks pretty nice i love the consistency of their crumble oh yeah not dry it's got a really nice uh smell to it i'll give these a try and uh let you know how it goes thanks a lot", "BjQcbPAd884": "welcome welcome welcome to another stream I'm your host as always Justin this one's gonna be a fun one hi this is this is one of those episodes that has been heavily heavily heavily requested so I think this is one that y'all are going to enjoy a whole lot today we're going to be talking with my good friend Kevin Chen he runs a very fascinating company that is engineering yeast to produce all sorts of interesting things we've talked about yeast engineering many times on the streams and in videos and generally a lot and so it's I think this is gonna be really cool to talk to someone who is doing this sort of professionally and and commercially and also just making a really interesting compound so without further ado let me introduce right your life my life okay oh there we go knocking okay cool ah I'm on TV hi everybody tonight today I introduce myself first or how do you want to yeah just start cool so yeah pleasure to be here and pleasure to a see you all I guess on this nice Saturday afternoon you know it's it's a this I guess just asked me to do this a while ago and that to think about it a bit just because like I got my own obligations with my my company and it's a some professional that I do so there'll be a bunch of stuff that I won't necessarily get into and of course you know opinions are my own when it comes to talking about a lot of the stuff that we'll get into here but yeah we're a company were called hyacinths we've been around for a while now since 2014 working on this particular pathway and doing a lot of yeast engineering we've done some really really interesting stuff with this pathway which we'll talk a little bit about but otherwise you know the whole cannabis industry has been amazing to kind of watch it grow with the past six years and watch the science of it grow and watch the companies kind of develop and being in Canada and watching belts happen it's been super interesting just coz it's like weird yeah that nationwide like legalization or regulation in progress kind of a thing do you remember daddy has been do remember getting the little little card in the mail like saying like it's officially gonna be legal soon oh really I don't know I don't wanna get in that car no oh my god I I don't know if I saved mine but I wanted to frame it yeah and that's like one I mean it's super super interesting to kind of watch all this happen and and we'll talk more about the science stuff but the whole policy around this stuff and and everything is is also huge and it's you know interesting for Canada as a country you know nationwide to kind of create this stuff and kind of force it out in some ways like a lot of people you know we're pretty reluctant about the whole topic and want things to go longer you're not go so fast or whatever else but I guess the the government at the time then he wanted to push it out and for many you know for many reasons it makes a lot of sense to legalize cannabis but anyways yeah so so pleasure to be here you know we I thought this was like a nice thing to do just cuz like it's it's an interesting and fun for me a lot of the reason why I do what I do is because like I like to talk and share and promote science and stuff my my day job as the CEO of hyacinth involves a lot of more like business development in finance related stuff unless so like technology stuff so you know if there's any deep technical questions then I probably won't be able to answer those necessarily anyways it's cuz I haven't been in the lab in a while but I do follow all the tech very closely and watch how everything develops but anyways I think I think that was kind of like you know how how I first met you Justin as well we're like we just we just people who like to do science and people who would like to share what we do and in science and and that's why it's like super fun to kind of be here and and spend a Saturday afternoon with all 411 people I can probably be more by the end of all this cool but yes I mean so so in Kevin Kevin's a very cool guy he does very cool stuff and I like so I mean especially because I'm also working on engineering yeast he has been a fantastic resource just to just to like Santa Santa D Chuck stuff and and just be like hey you know am I am I going crazy am I doing this right he's like and so you know that's been that's been really great so I've got a hyacinth page open write a link to it in the description if you want to check it out it's a really cool company they make so let's talk about the the obvious thing the you know the the stream title says THC but as THC the only thing that you guys are working on no definitely not I mean we like THC is one of a hundred different cannabinoids that exist in cannabis over hundred I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there finding more to like every every time we're like we know all the cannabinoids and they were like no wait there's a new functional group on that one yeah yeah and there's yeah it's all the time new stuff so I mean it's almost I think what we work on is a good reflection of it's maybe a reflection of like how much interest there is around different cannabinoids so you know of course we read all the papers about new ones coming out and and those ones might be you know years away from the market but it's still something that we kind of put on our radar as like hey you know we'll have some development in that maybe one way or another depending on you know how we're broke those all come together you know there's a lot of that's like we're having a bit of a yes dream for use here we can get back in good okay so before the the stream went to [ __ ] we were talking about there are you know all sorts of different cannabinoids and also lots of other things that you guys were working on so let's let's say we can pick it up up from there and I'm just gonna try and keep my eye on the the thing and see if it freezes again hopefully we're good alright so you're saying so so are you are you just mostly working on the different cannabinoids and things in that pathway or are you also looking at compounds from other organisms as well no I'd say we're pretty much set on the cannabinoid pathway other things they look at in my spare time just for fun but or business business-wise that cannabinoids are yeah I mean and that's more than enough of like industry and and market to kind of you know develop and and to work on so it's huge okay fair enough so cool I'm gonna just bring up my notes and and see what the next topic is oh okay so let's talk about the the legality of derivative products in Canada so that we know that the the plant is now legal I mean there's literally a store down the street where you could just walk in and buy stuff yeah but talking about the derivative products specifically because I remember you were you were working on this before the derivative products were legal for sale so like you know you you could still work on them from like a research perspective but I remember there was like a time when you know you were still kind of waiting for the government to catch up before the things that you're making would be sellable basically so how is how has that changed and like it do you know how does that you know affect your your business now and yeah yeah indeed block these comments I'm reading too many of them they're funny anyways so so yeah with the where we sit with respect to regulations yeah it's been dishing to kind of watch things evolve over the years the derivative products that you're talking about is is it pretty so I guess in the history of Canadian legalization first it was like hey you're allowed to use cannabis and cannabis oils for medical purposes only and under prescription stuff and then in October twenty twenty eighteen it was like okay you're allowed to now buy cannabis and stuff in a store and there's like all nine ways to buy it as well just for consumers and then that evolved recently into you like you're allowed to now sell like you know chocolates that have like you know cannabis stuff in them too and things beverages and like a more broad category of things that that contain cannabis for the work that we do you know in general where we're interested in making THC CBD and other cannabinoids as ingredients so we're not gonna grow anything that would be so Keable necessarily but we might you know do something that or it could end up in like a pill or in like a cannabis oil of some sort or canet have been like you know other consumer product areas depending on you know where we get the most amount of interest but I hope that kind of explains like water derivative product is when we're talking about that stuff it's like anything that's that's not a cannabis flower almost and and I'd be like from a consumer standpoint where we fit the most we hit best okay but I would I would have like one one slight caveat to that which is that we might not necessarily see ourselves as a company going you know having a big role in that direction it really depends on who else we work with and how we decide to go to market in different areas and you know the area where we definitely have like a huge you know edge in is in like pharmaceutical manufacturing where you have to have like really strict call a standards really strict like you know supply chain and it has to be really robust to kind of supply people who are actually like using this as medicine and that's where like of course these production versus planned production start to make a lot more a lot more sense that you're going to be from a genetically modified organism I think we're I think they might be like me again damn it some people were saying it's because of my website yeah I mean I scrolled down that okay yeah the little animation thing was was slowing it down right hold the whole website runs out these little animation things that's what I mean you might wanna okay well Celeste open this page although in a bit like now the freaking site hub thing is gonna have little animation do so alright [Music] yeah okay it's still very present well this is definitely gonna hurt the concurrence but that's okay I'm gonna just you know what I'm just gonna pull up your face [Music] yeah I mean it's kind of frozen hopefully the so it says screen froze audio okay so we're just gonna we're just gonna keep chatting and hopefully that'll eventually the video will catch up or something yeah yes the screen froze audio is okay I don't know what the deal with that [ __ ] is but well we'll figure it out okay so um speaking of so speaking of legality waiting for the streamed video to catch up but as long as the audios fine we can still talk about this so the the thing comes from a genetically modified organism so is there extra restrictions oh there is there like extra paperwork that you have to do and like testing before you're able to sell your product because of that or is it still relatively straightforward I mean it's it you know always like kind of it's it it's complicated it's so complicated and and yeah having a GMO thing doesn't nationally make it that much more complicated than there wasn't a moment I would say it you know we've we've had to go through a lot of different regulatory changes over the years and let me think I feel like when we first started out it was actually easier for us to do it this way then it was for us like you know trying grow cannabis plants and now maybe it's a bit more reversed I guess from a regulatory standpoint and in the end it kind of varies from every every country to country that you're thinking about and this is like you know I think I think in the old regulations it actually took a bigger level of permit to grow cannabis plants for research than it did for like chemical synthesis or for biological synthesis of THC website nowadays I think it's all in the same okay and almost so it's actually being a bit easier to work with plants and and as easy it is to work with like a synthesis and stuff but then so in that sense it was maybe easier over here but I guess when I talk about the game over again they get regulations that usually comes into play more when we're looking at you know manufacturing and sales and and what you're actually selling and you know where you're shipping your strains and stuff and where you're doing all the manufacturing stuff like that and then it gets a bit more hairy city life you know if you wanted to do so yeah so like if you're selling the because I guess you're not selling the the organism itself you're selling one of the products so like chemically it's the same thing there's no difference right like GM like organic sugar and not organic sugar it's just it's just [ __ ] Chuck but so like if you were selling like a genetically modified corn for example that seems like it would be more of a regulatory hurdle than if you're just selling a product from a modified yeast cuz I guess there's a lot of precedent for selling modified yeast because like insulin and all the other and a lot of other pharmaceuticals are made through modified products I mean even even like rennet is made through like genetically modified organisms so yeah I guess I guess that would be a little easier like it there is that that precedent and precedent already kind of yeah and there's even like I mean there's ways a complexity that go beyond that of course and this is where like it's it's been a it's part of what makes the job fun you know here every time you look at a new regulation it's always a bit different or every time you look at a new different country it's a bit different as far as how they weight might classify one thing another thing but you know I guess one day people will figure it out and there'll be like more clear regulations for everything but for now I guess it's a you know we're paving that road you know all right that make sense so so so moving on and I guess the one of one of the big question is when do you when do you expect to see the stuff that you're making in in stores for the first time like are you are you getting closer is it still away a while away or like you know on a scale of like one to ten ten being like it comes out tomorrow one being like in ten years like where do you where do you figure you are on that somewhere between one and ten oh great okay I mean it's it's actually it's funny it depends it turns very much on the product that we were working with and how we which market we end up going on first and of course like you know I would say there's a reasonably good chance that we'll end up having products available in like Canada before we end up in the US for example and and there is like a pretty you know clear route to market in you know that we can take and then have our products coming out here you know soon soonish and by soonish I mean like maybe within the next like 1/2 years kind of thing but I get to some extent again it depends a bit on our depends a lot of different things that might like you know get is there and also depends on which product we end up wanting to you know push that route just cuz each you know each can I mode is different and do we want to like you know have you know do we want to partner with somebody else or do you want to do this ourselves or how do we do manufacturing and it's always different as of things I sort of come together have to come together in order to make this all work so so that's the the long long answer to that question by the way as far as like you know what we're able to do now is already like quite good in terms of producing something that you could put to market so technology wise things like are really working and we're really happy with how how we being able to progress you know on that topic like so I guess the big question have you actually managed because I know there's a lot of like theoretical technical stuff of like you know this is how it could be done or you know there will be companies where you know they will kind of pretend that they've managed to do it and then get all bunch of funding and then proceeded to do nothing so like happiness so have you actually done it like do you have a yeah of course yeah yeah yeah so like you've you've got a you've got a yeast that makes that like makes the compound right yeah cool very very cool so moving moving on this let's talk about why yeast is preferred over say just growing the plants specifically like it so kind of from a couple different different avenues like why why I mean like why why yeast versus just you know a factory full of plants like what what is the the just like most obvious benefit intersect I think it I'm thinking like there's a lot of benefits but like what's the biggest one right because I mean there's been something if you if you went down this route right like what was the what was the thing that really made you think that like yes this is the the way to go yeah I mean the biggest thing I would say is just having control over you know what exactly you're making and all of the processes that are happening like in that system to to do manufacturing is the biggest thing there's other advantages in terms of like scale and efficiency and how you can of course like put yeast in a big steel tank anywhere in the world and they'll don't know how to grow it and stuff there's there's a lot of reasons why why used to make sense but I think having having the ability to turn off on and off certain genes to be able to produce one compound or another compound or to discover new ones all of those you know things are are maybe the one of the most interesting things for right now in terms of growing growing a yeast over going a cannabis plant or trying to breed and you guys plan to do something different yeah okay and also it's so I think it's one thing that's that's kind of interesting like when we think about growing the the plants like there's sort of a bit of a misconception that it's this like super green that I mean you know pardon the pun but it's this like green technology where you know all you need is just sunshine and dirt and you can just grow these things but like the reality is most cannabis is grown inside which means that it's grown primarily using grow lights which is actually really energy intensive like I was I was reading a little while ago about the energy requirements of this specifically the the use case was in Seattle and as they were they were moving towards legalization like the amount of energy that the city was consuming I almost doubled just to like power all the lights whereas if you're doing the yeast thing like there's no there's very minimal in the way of power requirements like it's put yeast in a tank you know keep it mixed at a bubbler like you're not you're not you know burning thousands and thousands and thousand of watts on just keeping the freaking lights on so there is that little bit of a misconception and also like all that power generally I mean because most places are dumb and don't have nuclear so it's not like you're if you relieve you like you know if you're running all those grow lights off a nuclear reactor then yeah sure it's very it you know it's carbon neutral but or even carbon negative but like it's that's an almost not the case like it's almost always like natural gas like generators that are powering all of this stuff so like it's very energy intensive so I guess I guess in that regard like the the East thing is kind of good because you can also rely on the like tried-and-tested technology of essentially it's making beer basically like that's like it's making beer except the the end product isn't the liquid it's the you know the stuff that settles out to the bottom like that's that's really the the difference and like we've spent a lot of yeah like a lot of like thousands of years basically making like perfecting the art of making beer so it's like there's that there's that you know president of like we know what we like we know how that works like you get a big tank and you do the thing and you know and also like you know depending on so we were we were talking briefly before we before we got started about what you're actually using to grow the yeast and so something that you'd mentioned was that right now you're using kind of like the ideal growth media but potentially in the future you can use things that are less ideal but maybe cheaper or more environmentally friendly or you know maybe like offshoots from other production of stuff so so can you tell me a little bit more about that like what are you using I mean I know you probably can't get into like super super specific the secret sauce yes yeah yeah I know you probably can't tell me the secret sauce but like it in essence it's basically sugar water yeah it's like sugar water with some nutrients yeah I mean it's it's a there's there's all kinds of different ways to grow yeast on different kinds of media and and you can have been fine control of all the different components in like your your media composition and part of that is what will give you like more or less maybe yield a product too and so it's all it becomes part of like that the game is to figure out how all these different things and do the science into the research to figure out what the best thing is and and get there I guess but yeah you're absolutely right about like you know growing cannabis being like kind of more expensive process it's not growing like the same way that a lot of other agricultural crops are growing that are that are a lot cheaper to grow of course and and as far as future goes I mean yeah we were I guess but yeah we gotta talk about this but for the sake of the audience yeah once I mean once you have a yeast that does this you know yeast can continually be engineered and optimized in different ways and that could lead to a lot of improvements when it comes to the efficiency or environmental friendliness or sustainability whatever costs of of the whole thing and yeah that's part of the you know among the many reasons why this is like an interesting technology and why why we're doing this is that you can you know actually have these futures exist whereas you can't just kind of like you know suddenly get a kind of as plan to start you know consuming a different substrate you know overnight where like you plants or plants like they kind of they're sort of set in their ways like like engineering a whole plant to do something different is I mean it's much more difficult than like tweaking a gene or two and some yeast yeah so actually speaking of that so the idea of like okay so being able to grow THC in a tank obviously has its benefits and it has its immediate scalability so so why couldn't you say because like suspension culture for example exists for for plants right where you can take a little tissue sample and then grow the plant essentially in a liquid where it sits it doesn't grow as like plant it grows as like you know tank of weird green sooo so so why couldn't you do that for cannabis for example I guess I mean I'll never say I won't say never like somebody might be a figured as I would somehow and get to work properly but generally speaking like we like to use because it grows fast it that you can replicate it quickly plant cells are you're taking them out of like the preneur mole growth environment and trying to grow them in these fermenters and then that's where like you had you have to do a lot of special things to the playa cells to make them grow that way and then is expensive like really expensive yeah I mean I'm not like a plant cell culture expert but it's you know you can look at different products that are made from plant cell culture and I think they end up being like you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a kilo gram versus like you know tens of thousands of dollars a kilogram for example or millions of dollars a kilogram kind of thing you also so I've done a little bit of plant cell culture and like the the plant media usually is composed of what's called more chic and Scoob base because biologists are [ __ ] at naming things but also it's a lot of sugar so like you still need sugar like it it's instead of just yeast where it's like you know sugar and a nitrogen source and some air basically I mean like wine like a tube a wide nutrient for example for like growing what yeast like you need like the tiniest little bit per gallon of liquid whereas for plants like you need the more chickens cook and then you need the buffer and then you still need the sucrose so like it seems like you're kind of cutting out a lot of the the middleman with the the yeast versus trying to do it with with plants yeah and I guess the other idea that's important is that when you're growing like the canvas plant grows and it produces teach seeing this trichomes and that's where the kind of accumulates you know the thing reading right student put these big flowers on the plant that that's where the product accumulates and that's like a physiological property of the plant that's like super super interesting but to get a plant cell to do that exact same like effect in the cell culture then you end up with like a much Carter situation because you know clientele culture you got like at just sugar or sells they're all like flit around there and it's not the same environment as like of course you know a cannabis flower right yeah from some of the reading of it's doing like they don't like when you grow cannabis in suspension culture it doesn't even produce THC so you'd have to engineer the thing anyway to get it to be producing the compound in an organelle like in like in an organ of the plant that it normally doesn't in cells that it normally doesn't so it's like a huge engineering challenge more expensive media and it's finicky er like if something gets in there it like it gets contaminated the whole batch is [ __ ] and then you get to start again and it's like so it really does seem like when it comes to if you're like if you really want to grow THC in a tank like yeast really does seem to kind of be the way for it although I mean then there is a the question of like why yeast right like if you just need a microorganism why yeast versus say bacteria or algae yeah so it's there's a whole interesting interesting bunch of questions that come along with that and it really depends on maybe the product that you're making and that's where like I can I could argue that for some products plant cell culture makes perfect sense to manufacture the thing but it really depends on the the product and the cost of it and the complexity of the the actual pathway and everything like that but this is also like you know part of the reasons why you can choose you can choose which organism you want to do in in many ways yeast is great because it's easy to engineer it grows fast you has a lot of different kind of metabolic parts you can play with and and you don't see as much of that in like other kinds of bacteria or in in algae or whatever else you know you have to you might have to fight harder to get it to like take up different genes you might have to fight harder to get some of the genes to actually make function properly in different cell types and or you might have to like do more engineering with the metabolism to get it to like you know do the right thing that you wanted to do right there's more questions beyond this but like yeah growth growth rate and how they react to different products being made and how well it makes different ya can get into this like fun and complicated science of yeah metabolic engineering and I mean I think there was something important that you mentioned in there where it's like you know basically like yes you could express the genes in sort of whatever organism you want but it's not enough to just have the genes there like there's like all pathways require feedstock so if you can't also mess with the genes that control the feedstock you might like have great expression of the the couple of genes you want in like e.coli but if they don't have the ability to produce enough feedstock it kind of becomes a moot point where like you're just you're just not gonna get a very good yield even if you can express the genes just fine like like e.coli are very easy to get genes into but if they're missing the the like basement and metabolism to get you the the stuff that you need for them to even work like your yield is gonna suck yeah yeah and that's like I mean so many that's where it gets to be like yeah pretty complicated interesting science I mean it's why it it's part of the fun of the scientific job I guess and you can you can have a whole two hour session just on that or something like that right so there's there's been a couple of questions asking about the pathway so we'll get into actually talking about the pathway in a little bit I just wait I've got like a list of questions that I'm just kind of working my way through so once we've kind of talked about all the the background we'll talk a little bit about the pathway closer to the end because I mean it is a very interesting pathway there's some like really really interesting chemistry in there that I'm excited to talk about and also I'm gonna be showing there were some comments about the side link like I've you you provided a paper that from a different group that is doing this and and you know one potential pathway that they're using and because I think one thing that it'll be important to talk about later is that you know there's there's there's many ways to skin a cat right like you can you can get to the same end product chemically through very different rats like their might and and you know one route that might be easier to engineer might not necessarily have the best yield and and that kind of thing so we'll talk about that a little bit later so let's just kind of keeping to the the you know talking about the the industry and the like kind of business aspects of this cuz I mean really like at the at the end of the day the only thing that makes any of this work is the fact that like you've got the you know money and backing to do two thing so where do you see the the industry going like this I mean this is a very new interesting take on the the thing that the industry I mean in in Canada within the first like weeks of them opening the industry up made millions and millions and millions of dollars so like where do you where do you see the the industry going now that things are becoming more legal and and more products are available and all this kind of stuff well yeah for starters all the products gonna be made by yeast one day there won't be any kind of this production going on anymore very soon people will still want to go cannabis in the future someday but a there's I think that I mean the industry as a whole where do I start so one of the interesting ways to think about the industry is you know looking at the alcohol industry you are the tobacco industry and see how those have gone or are going and see where cannabis like could head eventually and you can draw all these like interesting cultural comparisons between like all these different things that exist I mean as a whole it's like a lot of interesting questions that like you know everyone has to ask for themselves culturally and also black politicians have to figure out like how do they see this unfolding and and how do you see you know legalization existing or continuing just kissed or do you see it going or not and what else you know it's it's I think one of the cooler and more interesting ideas about this stuff is that you know it's this industry that's coming from this very like taboo black market into like this legalized market and if you think about like you know the way these compounds actually work and and how beneficial they are or how not beneficial they are for different you know cases and compare that to like you know alcohol for example then you know you could argue that the the health impact of alcohol is a lot worse than the health impact of like you know cannabis related stuff or those compounds that are there that are interesting well I mean like alcohol kills literally millions of people per year whereas I think cannabis is killed zero yeah I think that that's like and also like the only the only reason that like cannabis was illegal in the first place was racism Oh like like yeah back I mean was it was it Nixon I remember but the whole the whole war on drugs started as a way to basically shut down like government dissent because they knew they had nothing on the protesters so they're like well if we can just make there right so it's been it's been really you've been watching at one of the Netflix the 13th cuz that the documentary where they they really I haven't seen owe us that ones no I haven't seen okay you talked about about this stuff which is secret it's actually super cool but I recommend watching it you're gonna happen but but yeah you're right you're right it's this interesting set of laws I can devote which didn't necessarily have a solid basis of like reasoning why or it's just like general you know fear of stuff that people wanted it to go one way or another right yeah I mean I remember back in it what like while I was in university just having like casual conversations with people who were like really against cannabis like they're just like no it's evil and we shouldn't enema like I wish but at the time I didn't know that the whole reason it was illegal was because of racism so like I I'd had that like a little bit of tidbit to be like so so oh you don't like it why well you know it's illegal yes but why was it illegal like well cuz it's bad for you know cuz of racism so you know that's yeah I mean personally I'm and this is totally just my opinion I think the war on drugs is really [ __ ] stupid like just it's dumb like it's it's it exists basically as a way to funnel people into prison and then use them as slave labor like it's really [ __ ] for and it doesn't hurt anybody like like someone smoking some pot is not gonna hurt anybody like there's definitely a conversation to be had of like it's not the like magical cure-all that people pretend that it is and like it definitely has health effects like it can totally [ __ ] your lungs up and that kind of thing but it's also not the like evil boogeyman that that it's it's often made out to be especially by what's the best way to put this older you know politicians in the 70s or something like that right 70s it's still all right like like earlier yeah like politicians still think like love to demonize it as this awful like horrifying thing when it's like it's just a [ __ ] it's just a plant chill and it's cool I mean the cool thing is like how many people maybe are being convinced now of the opposite and the way that this is all being reconsidered where it's like you know you can actually ask the question like how dangerous is this really and and actually have you know science back up some of these things and that's part of you know the cool cool things that are happens in this industry and and now that is even being like you know the the leading edge of these kinds of thinkers are starting to do stuff like oh we can do like clinical trials with like MDMA or without science and treat PTSD and start to push things in that direction too which is really really cool because you can you know it started to see these new medicines that are being considered which whereas in history they would not have been considered at all because it was in the legal taboo around them and seeing this like yeah nice way of stuff in cannabis and even more like newer waves coming in like other areas too which is which is exciting too yeah and I mean as and I mean on that topic like there's other plant or well organism derivatives because I wouldn't I mean a fungus is not a plant but like you know there's all this fantastic research on how like psychedelics can be you used for like like really serious benefit for people with depression and all this other stuff and obviously like I I always like to you know put the little asterisk on that one where people get a little bit too excited about this and then less that becomes their only thing it's like okay like you you still probably could use some antidepressants but the fungi are good too but or you look at the opioid the opioid crisis has a can either case example where like that's something that was you know pushed legitimately by like industry and then turned out to be like the worst thing ever right like you can put them in prison for us yeah yeah it's really crazy right so it's this funny so it's nice to kind of see these stories come out and be be open and be like popping the stories and people can kind of like a look at those and say like oh yeah we did that wrong very obviously and and now we can think differently about things which is nice also there have been some really interesting research on in areas where they've made cannabis legal like the use of opioids goes down because you know people have other methods of I mean because it's not magic like it doesn't just like make pain go away perfectly like that's it's not how biology works but I mean when it does make it better and more tolerable and so like there isn't necessarily as much of that like need for like narcotics so you know that's that's been really interesting and I'm and I'm excited to see kind of how that continues to develop especially I mean especially in Canada where we were essentially becoming this like really fascinating use case although I do find it also very funny when like so in Quebec for example like they tried to make it illegal to grow the plants yourself like you could only get it from and you know they always make the same stupid justifications like we need to protect the children what if the children get into the plants I'm like well then you're with the fight then you can make first of all what child goes around just like chewing on the plants like if your kid does that you have bigger problems because it like if they're doing that with like a cannabis plant oh they're gonna have real exciting time when they tried that with anything that's outside they're going to die yeah but you know so for people who are not familiar with this the federal government set it so that each individual province could set how many plants you're allowed to grow and Quebec being [ __ ] Quebec decided to be dicks about this and decided to set that your the the number at zero but this was struck down by the Quebec Supreme Court where they're basically attempting to make something illegal which the federal government has explicitly said is legal so because they've tried to be dicks when the law got like undone and it got set to the federal maximum so instead of just like being you know kind of conservative about it'd be like you can have one plant they tried to be dicks and now it's four so like I just I find that deeply entertaining like because I mean the the people who are in and I mean this is getting into all the politics and chick which is not particularly interesting but the people who are in charge in Quebec are you know they're they're very you know that you know they're they've got that like old-school stance of like all drugs are bad and and also they're fairly racist but that's another problem for another day but yeah so that's that's been very interesting and it also it like you know they'll make the excuse of like we're trying to protect the children when in reality it's like no they just want to have a monopoly on the sales it's most of what it is but anyway so that's that's that so let's let's move on from the the kind of like politics and vitriol because as entertaining as I find it it's it's probably not super interesting to listen to it yeah you know different guests different Channel just for that yeah right I could have all sorts of people just to like you know [ __ ] on the government that's it's my favorite thing to do moving on so so actually well speaking of the government are you preparing for the eventual legalization in the US and are there are there other countries that you're also lying because I know there's like in like the Netherlands like there's some amount of it's it's some somewhat legal like so are you looking at other markets outside of Canada or like you know what's you know what's it what's your take on that yeah short answer is yes definitely looking at at its South out of Canada and and that's one of the nice things about the East system is that there are many vacuums so inside of Canada that you can leverage to do this very quickly it really like everyone Dreier like everybody well I guess we'll talk to me we'll get any more into that later and then why is different a bit but are there either wait that does the air side there is many packing facilities that you just like around the world that do this kind of stuff with with yeast and the production so yeah a lot of different uh versus we go a lot of different regulatory considerations for each different country and definitely yeah I don't know what will happen in the u.s. like we'll see how that goes I think I haven't heard too much recently about who's the next one pushing for like cannabis related legalization and stuff but there's been a lot of activity there and of course now I think the majority of states have at least some like you know legal access to cannabis and maybe that's the way that'll go will just be that all the states legalize and then eventually a federal you know government has to make a decision but it's all yeah interesting exciting stuff to see see who will do what and there's even some like finer differences between like whether you're looking at like THC at the product or as like CBD is the product and then whether you're going like hemp or whether you're going like cannabis and then it's also gets a bit funny but yeah a lot of a lot of interesting lot of doors that are that are opening very cool very very cool I mean I personally I look very forward to seeing it it all get legalized in the States just because it's I mean kind of getting back into politics it's like it's just funny watching the like old stupid politicians being like there's Brad whereas like I think it's it's the like a significant majority of Americans are like no this is fine the [ __ ] you talking about like so you know that's that's been very interesting okay so let's get into some of the the more technical aspects of this and you know fingers crossed that as soon as I tap off of Skype that the stream doesn't just [ __ ] the bed but okay let's let's start with the the simplest cuz it was something that you sort of just mentioned um when it comes to actually growing the yeast like what does that look like like so I mean it's it's some flavor of bioreactor I assume but like what what does that look like is it a big steel tank is it you know smaller little reactors like how is it is and like do you is it gonna be grown in like a large batch that you then harvest or is it something that you're kind of constantly pulling off you know small amounts of the yeast and media like howhow are you looking at that like what's the because i mean like you said it like you said that it's not like growing beer so growing beer you do it is as big batches so I guess you're doing kind of constant systems no not necessarily and that that's something I'll defer to like you know we it's it's pasta development it's like a workflow that you try to figure out like what's the best way to make something and and maybe it is by doing a batch maybe it's by doing a continuous like extraction process there are different ways to to go about it and and it's a lot of stuff that you know might become like trade secret stuff will become patentable stuff one day someone get too much into exactly what we're what we're doing but it is fundamentally different than like growing a beer yeast where you're trying to get it to produce like you know ethanol and and you have like these you know maybe somewhat similar kinds of feedstocks that are always being used there so you know I wouldn't say we could I would say like our manufacturing will look a lot more like insulin manufacturing right where it's like a big steel tank very sterile conditions very controlled environments very controlled like media and all this other stuff and and less like a like a beer fermentation and that's like a yeah and the students we really want to go that way but I don't think I don't consult I'm just just really quickly we just had a donation from mon stead he says I couldn't afford 420 like 420 and for four dollars and twenty cents seemed a little bit too low so he donated $42 so thank you very much Mon stead greatly appreciate it so so getting back on do it I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna see if I can pull up some images of what an insulin bioreactor looks like I am very sorry if this bricks the scream and if it does we're gonna we'll switch back to the Skype view so bear with me if this if there's bricks but assuming that it doesn't then it'll actually let us look at some more images you know not not that also I just noticed that you've got a Spira card thing in background yeah which [ __ ] yeah shout-out to to Elliott Spira and Elliott both - very cool [ __ ] we talked about him on the last stream actually so okay let's let's pull some stuff up so this is the so this is the the paper that you linked to me and it says the complete so the name of the paper for those who want to follow along is called the complete biosynthesis of cannabinoids and their unnatural analogues in East so I mean it's exactly what it sounds like it's using yeast to make cannabinoids and included is a wonderful little biosynthetic pathway and it might I mean it's definitely complicated like it's not a you know one enzyme and then it just happens kind of thing like there's a lot of different enzymes in here I mean you can even see that on the you know some of the unlike one one side there's like one two three four five six one eight like there's like nine different enzymes just to get to like one of the initial feedstocks so like it it definitely has its its quirks but I mean the main thing here is basically it's it you get two two different products so GPP and oay and we'll talk about those second I'm just trying to keep out of the corner mud and see if the stream is lagging and it doesn't seem to be so I think we're I think we're good okay so obviously the route that your company is going down is potentially different than this like we said earlier there's lots of ways to skin a cat so which it's a very weird expression but I think about it but don't don't skin your cats leave them as they're cuter that way but you know so this isn't necessarily the pathway that you're going for but it's one example pathway so to me the things that they really stand out here are first off GP p so GP p is actually something that we've talked about in many streams before because it is sort of it's it's one of like two compounds that basically act as the the feedstock for most are not most but many many different metabolites so I've got a window pulled up over here so this is hopefully not gonna break the streaming empty but so for example I'm just gonna I'm gonna move your your floating head here so GP p is geranyl pyrophosphate basically the way that like yeast and plants and and this sort of thing will go about making compounds is very different than the way like we would do this in like a flask in a chemistry lab right so just just the thing that I've got pulled up here I'm starting with this one initial compound like you can make literally hundreds of different compounds depending on which enzymes act on it so the fact that THC is made from GPP is actually I find fascinating because it like I said it's it's something that is you know extremely ubiquitous in in biology um so in this case it's GPP inouye and so the Oh a is a little bit tonic but I'll live tall olive italic acid [ __ ] biology it's hard to browse thanks but so again this is another really interesting example of there is absolutely no reason that we would ever do this this way at a flask but like in a biological system it makes a lot of sense so you can see that it's this really weird long poly key tide this being that the ketone unit polyketide that gets cyclized into the the aromatic group so in this case you've got one long weird compound that ends up with you know aromatic on one end and a dangly hydrophobic bit on the other end and then when you combine these two so like once you've got GPP inouye like a suit is just off the top of your head do you know if away is present in yeast normally or is that something you've got to add so Oh way is not present in this normally yeah definitely at that that's that's the first first recombinant step I guess okay so that makes sense because I know GBP definitely is so okay cool so you'd have to so I guess that the orange is probably stuff that is already in the yeast whereas blue is stuff you have to add and you can see that it all starts from acetyl co a like it's it and or like hexanoic acid these are both like fairly basic simple things we actually looked at hexanol in stream very recently I think was the last week week before so you know all but just to be able to get to this end product because you need this thing you've got to make this whole pathway work which I mean that's a lot of enzymes potentially so I mean I'd like you'd like we said like obviously you can't comment on the exact way that you're going about it but like already just just to get the process going this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 enzymes just to get this first feedstock here like that's a lot of engineering just to get to this point so it's I I'm I just want to convey like how potentially difficult the thing that you guys are doing is like there's a lot of work that's got to go into making these things work and function and just just to make the end product and so I mean it seems like a fairly simple step once you get to this point like you've got your GPP you've got your Oh a and it just looks like it's too in like two enzymes basically just to get to either THC or CBD and this is this is also kind of cool like you can start with these same two feedstocks and just changing one gene dictates what your end product is which so I think that kind of leads into or harkens back to something that you mentioned earlier where you know changing one or two genes lets you tweak the the end product and so you can get these two very different very valuable products using only a small amount of modification like once you've got the like initial stuff set up which I find that very cool and I mean by the by the looks of this this is these are both the THC or CBD a and you can see that it I'm gonna make this little bigger so this is obvious you can see that there's a little T here this is not an enzyme this is just Heat okay good old-fashioned heat so yeah there's just just kind of interesting into it which to me I find this interesting because that's the exact same thing that happens in the plant like when you like it's if somebody is like smoking the plant for example that's where that heat is coming from so it's like the the it becomes the active form when you heat it not necessarily in advance so I just find that interesting so I guess actually that's I mean that that raises an interesting point are you gonna have is one step in your process like say you decide to make your product into a pill or you get is is you gonna have to like roast it at some point like is like to do that that conversion like is there gonna be a like a cooking step and like do you do you expect that to mess with your yield a little bit like cuz I mean as soon as you're heating something like you're definitely gonna destroy it a little bit so like is that something that you're you're already kind of trying to account for yeah it's part of the process overall I'd say and something that also needs to be looked at yeah you're gonna have to deal with that one way or another okay no I think there's something else that we've got going on that's like mainly gonna like you know kind of find an interesting way to cut around that but I won't get into that but basically yeah I mean when people make like cannabis oils for example like you you're extracting from the cannabis plant and then you're ending up with like you know a THC a in this like oil or whatever and then you you have to heat that to to get it to be like decarboxylated and then you actually have the active ingredient in the oil because normally you normally use smoked cannabis right that's where I get me carboxylated but like I'm making an edible like it gets decarboxylated I mean a lot of people will do it before they even start the cooking process but a lot of the time it just happens in the cooking process so it's like at some point you got to put that that energy in there to like knock the blonde off yeah yeah I guess so and there's a lot of actually interesting things beyond that when it comes to like using just see th CA and CB da in their original forms as like more like therapeutic products but you know usually when people talk about these compounds are talking about THC and CBD as being the ones that are the active you know things that that people really want to use that will have like kind of an impact right but you might even go to find more things beyond that so actually speaking of this light so and I mean of course you're you're free not to answer if this is but is there a like because I mean THC and CBD are they like really famous cannabinoids but is there another cannabinoid that you find particularly interesting like something that you're thinking of maybe pursuing one day or has interesting properties like are there any that stand out is basically what I'm asking let me think there there are many best and it would actually maybe I'll think for a second and then come up with something that ferno's maybe more specific but let's see I mean one of the if gonna look at something interesting that's what we're talking about is like a recent publication with a compound called THC they gave it a name which is a bit silly but THC P I guess which most everybody things cuz you never know what's gonna come up yeah hopefully you'll get this paper which is which is talks about this compound just a slightly different variation on th see that that apparently had some kind of like higher affinity for like the receptors which doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be like better or worse than then THC originally was its but it was like kind of a funny headline to see that come out and then like be like oh that might be like an interesting thing and and then but in reality if you know you're gonna file chemistry you'll be like oh cool that's nice to see that they've proven that and like cell lines and stuff maybe you got on transit to humans then it could be an interesting target but do we actually need a stronger form of THC like maybe not really okay with the regular form of THC that's right that's really interesting kinda like they're like it's it does the same thing it's just stronger like yeah and actually if you want to get into like the history of this whole like industry and it's the the perspective of like you know compounds that are stronger or weaker or whatever it's all said this is you is this found in the plant like as far as this synthetic as this found in the plant so you could I think this is one that the recent so we've seen minor camino it discoveries so like you could breed the I mean this would be a shitload of work but like in theory you could you could breed plants for this cuz I know that like the actual biochemistry of the plant itself like you kid there's a there is a hard threshold of like how much THC you can actually get in the plant before it just dots so like I think it's about 24 or 25 percent it just it plant gets real sad at that point like it does it doesn't like it yeah so I guess that that that raises a really interesting possibility of if you could breed this stuff and select for this rather than the traditional THC you could get more potency in the same amount of like gram for gram worth of stuff and and kind of surpass that strength threshold which sounds kind of [ __ ] like 25 percent cannabis is already very strong thank you you'd have to be like have a heroic tolerance to be able to even like deal with that casually without it just knocking you on your ass for a week but you know hyperbole obviously but like it's that's a really acting concept as as people like especially now that it's legal and people are able to study this more that it'll open up these like new discoveries of like hey you know maybe we've been selecting for this the wrong cannabinoid all these years maybe there's you know maybe there's something better so that's that's really interesting and I think it's yeah I mean it's like one difference of bond-like it's a trans instead of a syst bond or something like that's that's yeah wild you could get into actually I had two things to say on that one is that it's it's a fun thought experiment think about like why why wasn't this compound not already selected for in the book history historical of like you know use of cannabis like people say like oh yeah you know kind of busy be so much weaker like years ago and then people selected for it now you have like these high THC strains or whatever but why why wasn't why it was THC P not the high you know high THC strain or whatever and I guess I'd ties back to like you know some fun name is a evolutionary geneticist watching and who can dig into this and sugar and seven or something like that but I guess like Brussels sprouts like how Brussels sprouts used to suck and then people kind of went back through all the old heirloom varieties and found ones that were not gross and so like those became suddenly this is why like there's been this weird Renaissance and Brussels sprouts so I almost wonder if that would happen with this compound like if people start going back through the old like weaker strains finding one that's much higher THC P content and then just like using that as a new breed stock like that could be fascinating maybe but this is a this is my other point there's a there's a big big asterisk there which is which is that you don't you don't want to mess with this system almost in that and that in that in that way and if you look at the history of of the endocannabinoid system I guess and you can you can google around like all the the drugs that came up for the system and basically long story short there was a compound that people try to develop which is for when you've lost them for obesity and it did hit like the same receptors that THC hits and hit them pretty hard and it's kind of like optimized for that almost like it's one ease designer you know when when you look at the the structural biology of it and you designs things right and what ended up happening is that that drug got to mark it and then got recalled and eventually cut out I think altogether just cuz it was one of the big side effects was like really hard depression suicidal thoughts okay so you can look at the story it's the park is called Ramona bunt and think it was Sanofi that that was the one working on it and I don't get into the too much of the complications of how big firmer works but basically yeah you don't you know they want to have this compound exist and and have it you know be the main driver this industry because you might start to see those kinds of things and that also gets into the argument of like you know the term like synthetic cannabinoids which are like you know chemically synthesized compounds that are hitting the same receptors but they're not TV and also you need enough coming from plants and just these new compounds and that's where like yeah you have these stories of like I think it was the bath salts stuff that was a huge controversial in these new black market drugs that are coming out and causing all these problems so I mean THC is good because of the history of it like there's literally thousands of years of safety data in the sense that like people have been using it for thousands and thousands of years whereas all this new stuff you don't have that like historical precedent so yeah maybe THC P is way stronger but like like you say it could have horrifying side effects that maybe that's not what you want necessarily so that's that's really a thing that but I mean you could say yeah but I I look forward to those clinical trials like yes like but this is also the most fascinating so interesting things about this the endocannabinoid system thing right it's like this this system of receptors that you know does it seems like it has its hand in a lot of different things related to like human development related to like psychosis and all this other stuff obviously but there's there's it's still people are still trying to piece together these different receptors and how they all work together and whatever else it's not like a super simple system and for example like CBD people like CBD doesn't hit these two yeah you're looking at I guess looking at the live stream but I know this is like a few seconds behind so I'm like I don't know where we're at now see you on CB t receptors if you look at those receptors in like what hits them that's not like it's not like if you hit the cb1 and cb2 receptors harder you're gonna get more or higher or whatever you might just have like you know worse things happen is sometimes it breaks yeah yeah and then that then you had like these yeah stories that people using cannabis for things and so it's like this weird all those like weird backwards stuff happening with this this plant and what people are using it for and how that might one day become like mapped out from like a receptor standpoint but for now you know it's still a lot of science that's being done a lot of figuring out like how each compound works with which parts of the you know I like the biology and humans that it's hitting and it's one of the big challenges and I think if it was a simpler system than like you might not even have a as much attention towards this this stuff but because it would be solved to kind of cook the meeting but anyways right I mean it's fascinating I yeah and I mean this is this also like that that really does touch on the like I mean so I took a like a pharmacology like pharmacokinetics course at one point also just we've had a couple of donations that are like 4/20 themed so we just somebody donated four hundred and twenty rubles that was so thank you but you know so it and it was it was really interesting that like you know there's a few main like targets for for drugs generally but it's these tiny little changes can be like the difference between something working really really well and also having a horrible side effects and especially like when you get into the like generic versus like the original thing like sometimes they'll just like stick a functional group on a on a compound and technically it is equivalent and so you know they can there's basically like these these weird examples where if you stick specific functional groups on things like you can just barely shift it enough that it's not patent-protected anymore and you know because it's so similar you have their amount of clinical trial that you need to get it approved is way lower but because you've added this functional group there is the chance that like it might have been really important and then like it can have wildly different effects and so like that can be really really tricky and that's why some people will have [Music] like you know really unpleasant side effects when they switch from like the the name brand to a generic so that's really interesting I'm sorry that we just had a question it says all trips down is this more cool than economical so what do you think is this is this more cool than economical I don't I don't think so I think it's I think it's well you know I mean it's not really cool any cool pretty cool but I also think like it's very economic like my drawings also very very cool like Hank of THC and like swimming around in it sounds entertaining but like also it sounds very valuable yeah I mean I mean very quickly it starts to get a yeah sometimes my depends on my my days like sometimes it feels more cool but but it is still very very cool we got her yeah like I mean the number of days that I've been working on the spider silk thing and I just want to like light everything on fire just you know switch to gardening well I think it's a thing it happens but no okay cool so I mean that's no sort of what I expected like no but one thing just to quickly come back I'll correct you on this that the generic generic versions of a pharmaceutical product are supposed to be identical like factually identical I think what you're talking about is something called biosimilars where it is like a slightly different modification and gets around these like patents and then you end up with like maybe different different effects and but I don't want people to start buying brand-name drugs and that's really changing the economy but that direction is not like a good thing necessarily for like the the main compound isn't necessarily the difference like some sometimes in a generic like the the main compound is the same but they might have added a different like filler or something that [ __ ] with the exact behavior of the hill in the person not that not but I mean that's not to say that a generic is worse than a brand name I mean it is I mean I'm like I'm on a generic and it works just fine but there definitely have been cases of just I mean it's it's biology as soon as you [ __ ] with one thing like somebody's system is gonna respond to it differently so yeah and I guess there's a there's another interesting area of like experimentation that's just around like hey like can we take like yeah again I used to keep these apples DTC is available in like as a pill you can get like THC pills under prescription and so it's a product that exists it's usually used for helping people with appetite and symptom management when they're going through chemotherapy you can also get something that's called Sativex which is a product from a company called GW Pharmaceuticals and that's like a it's actually a cannabis extract that's I think CBD and THC together also available under prescription for the similar kinds of situations and then just recently there's a newer one that came out which is actually a liquid form of of THC essentially which is just like I guess it again it'll get absorbed differently it'll it'll maybe react a bit differently but it's you know all variations on the same same sort of thing and maybe in the end this is better for consumers because you just have like all these nice options that you can choose from and if you if you can't swallow pills and great and take a liquid option right and also I mean either with like speaking of THC specifically like I know lots of people who are totally fine to smoke it but as soon as you put it into an edible they're like nope I'm I'm done like they'll they'll have like you know heart palpitations or whatever whatever the case may be like wildly different effects even though it's exactly the same compound like that that delivery mechanism really can radically change just the way your system responds to things and I find that fascinating I mean it's it's totally not necessarily fun to experience it firsthand but but from like a detached scientist perspective like no this is fascinating apparently if you deliver through one organ it goes this and you know that kind of thing so like that's a find that fascinating totally yeah and this I mean the crazy thing about the cannabis industry specifically when you think about that stuff is that you have so much experimentation already happening when it comes to like you know the different edibles different oils different ways people are dosing themselves at the stuff like both illegally and and legally I guess and that's that's what I mean where things start to yeah it's a little bit backwards where you have a lot of first-hand experience that's coming back and being put into like the pharmaceutical industry maybe and then people developing products like has a reaction almost but yeah I mean like especially because it was illegal first like yeah and and that whole the whole culture of it developed whilst it was illegal and now they're trying to like you know back propagate that essentially like I mean I remember when like concentrates were first becoming a thing and I mean cuz like hashish has been around forever but like the the like the butane extractions and now the the co2 extractions and all this kind of stuff like we have lots of data on what happens when you interact with the plant but we don't have a whole lot of data what of what happens when you're like literally just taking in the pure thing so you know that's that's been very interesting that now there I mean know that it's legal they can actually study this [ __ ] properly which really is what they've needed to do the whole time and like I still think it was done that was illegal the first place but like it's I I hope that now especially now that they're looking at other things like MDMA ketamine all those kinds of things and looking at them for pharmaceutical or like from a pharmaceutical standpoint like I think it's I think people are kind of learning their lesson from cannabis and that like you really do need to like get as much studies done as you can but because I mean inevitably it's gonna be applied to millions and millions and millions of people so you know getting getting as much of that info in advance before you have to find [ __ ] out the hard way is definitely definitely valuable so I think that's yeah yeah so like everybody's learning a bit from how this is uh this whole industry is developing and you know what and this is like why legalization is also such a complicated thing we're like yeah sure it's a you know statistically or whatever else economically you can think of all different reasons but also like you know the hope and dream was that you legalize cannabis nobody gets hurt right but then in reality maybe some people do get hurt and then you have to you know deal with that I guess and I don't know I'm not an epidemiologist or like a policy analyst or whatever else so I kind of can talk about these things and not feel like I'm trimmers are supposed to do anybody I guess yeah and I mean that's the rest the responsible thing like I mean there's there's nothing worse than somebody pretending they're an expert and then being wrong yeah or like I mean there's actually funny if you everything so it's it's all it's all super cool it's all really interesting biochemistry if you want to like you know think another funny thing about you know cannabis legalization stuff I think one of the points that I remember being a the age at which you're allowed to start buying cannabis in Canada was one of the ones that maybe was the gay bigger conflicting point when people had more flexibility on how they wanted to do that and that was like very much a on one hand I think the science was saying like not until you're 25 or like there's like a task force out coming together with within Canada it kind of said like yeah we should set the age here but then the federal government decided that actually should be kind of either 18 or 19 and then of course Quebec I think is 18 and then other provinces are 19 it depends on how they how they match it I mean Quebec is trying to push into the 19 actually I think they wanted to put out like 21 like they really wanted to push it back yeah and actually legitimately that could be the right thing to do of course and that's that's why I like the task force recommended to 25 or whatever something higher and then but I think that might have been I think one of the main arguments against that was that actually you know a lot of the use cases of illegal cannabis end up being that age smaller age range anyway you kind of want to be able to address that with like the legal market and then it becomes an economic decision rather than like a health care one but and also like if you try and restrict it to 25 then you end up with the exact same problems that you have with alcohol or cigarettes or any of the other things it's like yes technically it's illegal but if it's available people are still gonna get it regardless and like I mean it was and that's the thing it was illegal for a very long time and it's not like people in who are like 15 or 16 have any real trouble getting it like it's a thing so you know that's I suspect that they probably took that into account as well like it's like from a science standpoint like yes you should avoid it until at least 25 so because then it can sit as you know interactions brain development and all this other stuff but then from like an economic standpoint and also just a legal standpoint and a like functional standpoint like how do you actually keep it out of people's hands and like because if you make it illegal and people are just gonna get it anyway like now you're just running right like headfirst right back into the same problems you had when it was legal where now you're gonna criminalize people for having it when you know like it's a kind of a personal responsibility thing and also like they're gonna do it anyway so like I think it's one of those like yes you can put out the recommendations of like but you really shouldn't but people are going to anyway like it's yeah yep so it's super interesting super complicated but a part of what it boils down to and this is I mean it's a nice thing to say cuz we have like a big audience here I guess I can say like hey you know when it comes to using this kind of stuff or anything in general in life just like try to be healthy you know you know like you've got you'd be probably everybody has friends or heard of different kinds of people and how they use even like the more psychedelic drugs and you can hear people using those things like really responsibly and having like you know experiences that make sense but of course if you don't do that responsibility responsibly then you're gonna have problems or they're obvious like you know situations that you really want to stay away from like you know you could you could easily argue that you know maybe actually I don't think stupidly like I would say actually a good thing the point that I can point to is like difference between like the culture around maybe alcohol and in different countries yeah where in the u.s. it's a lot higher drinking age in Canada it's a bit lower and in Europe it's even lower and then you have to think about you know which nation that has the most sensible policy and it might be more of a cultural thing where like the people in you know grow up with the right kinds of education and the right kinds of like understanding culturally of how to use alcohol safely or or how to enjoy it I rather than like abused it obviously and the same thing to some extent applies to the the Canada some use a whole and I think that was one of the you know dreading dreaded things about people you know legalization happening is like how many people are going to end up abusing this reason it's the wrong way and having a really bad you know effect and then and then they have to repeal everything which is you're fortunate things happen like that all sorts of problems also sorry not not to cut you off we just had a really big donation so I just need to say a huge thank you to Jack for you we've we've actually just hit our fundraising goal so that's super cool so on the on the next stream we'll be starting the next one thank you so much greatly appreciated I'm glad you enjoy the channel okay so it's back to the back to the discussion at hand sorry I was really exciting I've been so I don't I don't know if you I mean you can see it in the thing the donation goals are I've finally decided that I need a new editing computer because I've been using the same laptop for like five years and it makes very angry noises when I'm editing it doesn't like it so I'm building myself a like a proper tower so just I'm like doing I'm just doing the fundraising like piecemeal cuz you know I want to get good components and I want to make sure that I don't have to do this again for hopefully five or six years yeah you know doing that is greatly appreciated all the people who've been donating by the way super awesome so yeah very very cool so I'm just I'm gonna have just a quick peek into the end of the comments cuz I mean I think we've we'd actually gone through my whole list of stuff that I liked you know we've pre-prepared I don't I don't actually yeah I think we I think we've basically covered all that so I'm gonna just go through the comments and see if there have been any interesting and and also guys if you if you have comments or questions that you want to ask Kevin now is the time so yeah this so let's let's see what we go [Music] this is as soon as you do that like the like comments flood in faster so like as I'm trying to like read one it just the thing keeps moving on its own and [Music] [Music] I mean it's been a lot of like bickering I'm not actually seeing any any good questions yet hey come on like you know now is your opportunity opportunity of a lifetime asked asked the the magical east man some questions I you know I the thing is I saw some some earlier so I'm kind of like scroll up to it to see if I can find them I mean there's there's definitely been some some questions about like you know could other drugs be made this way and I mean the answer is is sort of a resounding yes but it also depends like you can't make LSD just because that's a weird like weird chemistry it just doesn't work but you can make psilocybin and there's been some very interesting papers we were talking about this a little bit before we got the the stream started where there you could totally make psilocybin with yeast you can you can take the genes out of the fungus and express them in yeast and works just fine but you know then it gets into the difficulty of the engineering process and a lot of that stuff oh actually there was one thing it was so you know you're you're selling or you're looking to sell the derivative products so the actual like oil itself but have you considered just sourdough well because I mean then the yeast is dead like you're no one's gonna be you know stealing your intellectual property if you're selling it it's like toast but but is that something that you've considered like or is it I think there's I think there's a some some of the articles that we get featured and had like a picture of bread and then has a quiche or the marijuana leaves on there something like that until I kind of it's just as like a header for like a article or something anyways yeah thought about this I think you don't end up with enough yeast in your dough or in your bread in the end that it actually be interesting in any in any way that's sorry what about like Marmite I mean barbecue grubs but it would do the J like it's not to say that like you know we'd concentrate is any better like yeah I mean if that's something you're looking at like rather than going through that like whole much more difficult process of like purifying the compound like would it be potentially easier to just like make some weird THC Vegemite technically yeah it might be easier to produce a yeast that way but I think you know coming back to like the different processes to use things I don't think you might get enough actually do you think for a second anyway the triceps we thought about this a bit and and but I think it starts to not work actually it starts to break down when it comes to like maybe which yeast is actually used for these different things and like you know do we actually want to try and you know will that Marmite that we might make with our yeast still tastes as good as the Marmite that because I mean because you play so much with the metabolism of the East and the types of yeast that you're using then you might actually end up in this spot where like it really doesn't make any sense to try and do that and and it might be even like fundamentally impossible to like have the metabolisms work you know in such a way that you do end up with both scenario as possible actually and and this is why also like you can't just throw this into like a beer fermenter and get the same amount of product out you but you need some maybe some fire control or different kind of conditions that are gonna really turn up those yields okay so here's an interesting question I've been seeing some questions on like a like a biosecurity standpoint like are you worried about the yeast ever getting out like how are you gonna be controlling to make sure that like nobody accidentally because like if somebody else got a sample of your yeast like they could totally make some but like do you have I mean obviously you're not gonna have to comment on like the specific what are the security features of your warehouse and yes yeah is this something I mean I assume this is something that you you take fairly seriously and this is something that is is on your mind so it is it is something that is on our minds definitely thought about before you know if it were to get out then I think there's it's just get more technically difficult to grow this kind of yeast and that's where I would be like less worried if somebody on the street like happen to get it you there's different this room I could argue different reasons like why it's like make sense or not in the end we're just very careful with how we handle westerns at least and I'm just not gonna let it happen okay but I mean that's that we're only one of a bunch of companies working on this stuff so maybe eventually there will be somebody who does who does get the Jews released and I think I think that's it's a common question in like biosecurity in general is like how does this work and what happens here or there and and maybe hmm I mean have you heard of the the case of the the phage theft but I think we might have talked about this at some point in you know months ago but so there's this with and obviously this is not a one-to-one comparison with yeast because they don't they're not a virus they don't just get on everything but there's this really famous example of there was a lab that was working on a phage that killed a particular type of bacteria and another lab wanted it and you know had sent them an email be like hey would you set share and they're like no so they sent them a physical letter like I'd like an actual like written like please can we have a sample of your phage and so because it was a written letter they had to respond with a written lit written letter so somebody from the lab that had the phage wrote them a letter and was like no sorry we can't give you a phage and then the the lab that wanted it took the letter like sterile e blended it and just plated it and got the phage because there was a little bit like just from the being in the lab like it was just all neatly present and they managed to isolate it off of the piece of paper so like it's a file right like is so is that something that you might be concerned about like are like that may be someone in your production plant might get some on them and like you know so it was like hey man I'll pay you 10 bucks if I could swab your face or whatever like is because I mean that that seems like it could be terrifying from from like a security point of view so yes I guess you but but then again it's also with the yeast so let's someone's like sticking their hand in the VAT like this isn't really like a problem and you wouldn't do that anyway because it's got to be super sterile and all this kind of stuff so yeah yeah basically yes yeah you know it's not it's not so easy to just like get it and then grow it and then you're off to the races you know there's if you are really really smart biotechnologists that maybe you could try and like do something bad but I think we we just it's just part of being a company and having really good security protocols for handling all this stuff and getting gun situations and through it properly so it's not like something we haven't thought of or something that we're like you know particularly susceptible to and yeah you can almost you can also imagine it sort of like the same case where like like Humira or whatever is like this 11 billion dollar revenue drug or something like that imagine if somebody stole the strain that produces Humira and tried to produce that you know on their own probably the company that makes you mad will find out and then also sue the [ __ ] and then you get into trouble yeah but also you might you might have just have like a much does not grow the way that it grows the when we wrote it and then then you end up it's like just it doesn't snot feasible to actually like get a strain that way I mean and I guess like they'd have to be intimately familiar with your process because I assume it's on some weird selection agent with weird media and all this kinda [ __ ] so like unless it was like an ex-employee who like stole a sample and do the recipe and like we're getting into like Willy Wonka territory it's like I will pay you $10,000 for a never-ending Gobstopper kind of thing like yeah the park is like that isn't it yeah right exactly yeah well we all know what happened to the guy in dress the park right yeah I mean the thing is might have not actually seen Jurassic Park so oh really uh which I feel very stupid because like I'm I for all the [ __ ] that I do I really should but I I think it was one of those like it was the best way to put this I have a very low suspension of disbelief threshold and that one does in like it's like the concept doesn't work so like I it's it's hard for me to enjoy it because I'm like that's not that's not that's not how that works that's not how a anything works also like the like then there's the and this this has nothing to do with anything but like the the dinosaurs do not look like that like all of the which admittedly was an older it like especially the original one was an older movie so like some of the newer research where like most dinosaurs had feathers like hadn't been found yet but I just I wish they'd had a big feathery t-rex that would have been so much more fun like so yeah that's that's the thing but I know I'm gonna take a lot of [ __ ] for not saying Jurassic Park so now I'm gonna have to go from now I'm gonna have to go watch it but yeah anyway okay so let's let's see what other what other questions we've got I saw it because I saw a couple interesting ones goodbye I mean there's so there was also a couple of questions from the like offhand and you can't make LSD thing and the reason is that it like LSD is not a biological part like the the precursor is so either like the ergot derivatives or LSA or all these other things like those things can be made bio synthetically they are made by lots of different organisms it's it's that last step where you like take the precursor and actually like chemically transform it into LSD that you can't do by I mean as far as I know I could be wrong maybe somebody's made some weird freaky enzyme thing that does it but like as far as I know there's no enzyme that does that that last switcheroo so you make the precursors be like I mean you could totally make a yeast that makes her got her got amine or LSA it's just the the that is that last step that you just can't do [Music] [Music] oh so so what a question why yeast over algae because algae is also something that's that's typically thought of as you know being grown is the in these huge facts so is there any particular reason why you would go for for yeast over algae like what are their like are there any specifics uh yeah I mean we talked about a bit about earlier but it's kind of depends very much on like process metrics and also like the science going into like how you actually can engineer that organism so for example like the yeast metabolism is fundamentally different from like a holiday metabolism and you could argue that the yeast metabolism is more suited to producing these particular compounds because it has look you know that active you know this was precursors that are need to go into this pathway for example I assume you could get an algae to do this stuff which again there's differences in how you how a yeast will react with like you know being recombinant and having DNA in it versus how in algae would and that's where like this is pretty reliable the so after you've engineered the algae let's say then you can think about how you're gonna grow that and how you're gonna separate out your end product and you know if you think about algae you're more likely thinking about like white and co2 getting into to make it grow faster or better or whatever and that's where like you start to hit some hard like physical limitations you can't get more more light into an algae tank like you can't add more sugar and add more water and that's like even really fast and get it to high density cultures that are really efficient but the algae situation can be more complicated and then you could get it argument like oh but you can grow algae off of sugar too and then right I'll leave it at that like yeah it's processed yeah it is the process in the end and you know yeast is a pretty familiar process and very efficient process and a very vigorous process and then algae you may be like West less so okay I mean I and that makes sense also from from what I know like just the actual engineering of algae is more difficult like it's there I mean they're just kind of they're picky organisms and there just hasn't been like yeast has been extremely well studied because it's used for pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff like there's literally textbooks on all these different kinds of yeast strains on how to and how to engineer them and how to work with them and how to grow them whereas algae like we're good at growing it but actually like messing with its genetics is hard and just things don't don't necessarily cooperate so oh so have you looked at all at terpenes because you you know you've got the the THC have you have you thought about growing the you know the the flavor to go with it or is or are you more focused on the actual like pharmaceutically active compounds definitely more on the the active compounds there although some of the terpenes are starting to let me show some promise of in terms of being actual pharmaceuticals - okay but it that also like those are different pathways that are going to be different you know it could be made more easily by chemistry or extracted from another natural source and then it becomes there's already a process that exists for some of these ones as well like I think women even is it maybe is one of these ones that like limiting this kind of becomes by its industrial chemical it's also forget it yeah yeah we have lemons there's yeah so you know you don't need a yeast that can produce eliminating maybe where you could argue that and work at the economic I have that does that actually okay I got the only reason I haven't tried it is because there's no I think it uses uracil dropout media as the selection or like dropout media with with Europe no yeah it's you're still drop of media so it's it's missing uracil and I just don't have that like I don't I don't have drop up media so it's the only reason I've tried it because like oh my oh my yeast engineering tends to be using gee for Nate just because it's easy and g418 is cheap and drop OBD is expensive and annoying although actually so I bought some tryptophan dropout media I didn't even I didn't even want it I wanted the I came as a I got it as a kit from Carolina they sell the their bio builder kits one of them is a keratin yeast kit and I just wanted it I thought the kit came with this is actually really frustrating that so the kit was supposed to come with pre-engineered keratin producing yeast and that was the only thing of the kid I wanted they don't sell it separately you have to buy it as the kit so i bought the kit and the one thing that was missing that they forgot to pack was the pre-engineered yeast I was so annoyed but it came with a bottle of tryptophan dropout media so I'm like alright well now if I've got anything so I found a plasmid that that's Curie recombinants and the keratin plasmid that I currently have has loxp sites next to every single gene so if I take my pre-engineered yeast that I've already managed to make and I'm you know throw in the the creep plasmid which is on tryptophan selection I can now use that media to make like an integrated version of the thing and then I should actually get like really weird like color differences because depending on which one of the genes is running and in what quantity like you'll get different colors like if the if the keratin synthase stops working but the lycopene synthase is still working you get a red colony whereas if you've got both they look orange whereas if you know you get really low lycopene and really high kara didn't looks yellow so it's all this kind of stuff so that was just something that happened recently but like all so it's it's a very interesting thing of like you know when you've got all in like when you're trying to make a product that requires more than one enzyme like it's very interesting to see the dynamics between them so like especially with something like THC where you've got anywhere from four to eight to ten enzymes that you all need running at the same time like your your yield can vary wildly just in in small changes in the expression and like tweaking the individual enzyme so I think that's what the fascinating if you want to violations an interesting one I think that's another one of these a proof of concept kind of pathways that people like to play with because it makes a purple color and if you if you mess it up and it makes black instead then you play with the enzymes a bit yeah cool and so I'm not really gonna get into like talking about the specifics of Endre enzyme engineering but I suspect that you have had to do a little bit of that like the natural enzymes maybe aren't as active necessarily especially in yeast right like they're the plant enzymes for a lot of them so I assume you've had to do some work and I mean you don't need to go into the specifics but like what what does that process been like like how how do you go about that like what how do you decide like this is the enzyme that we're gonna mess with like you know do you is it done rationally or is it done randomly like do you just kind of like start messing with aminos and seeing like which ones like which end up with an enzyme that works better or is it something that like you find in research and you just try and replicate that so it's it's more like the I guess rational and and irrational approaches on I'm doing is I'm engineering stuff I would say like you know we have done is build like a really efficient way of going about doing that and that we're pretty pretty happy with I would say like our like our genome engineering or and the hydrating platform is really nice the and that's like that's what I get that's all I could save we're good but yeah I mean that's the that's the it's it's an interesting topic to kind of get into like different techniques events and some engineering that you can look at and and how I think if there's any good publications on this clear pathway in general or if anybody's really dug deep into that but anyways yeah getting a bit more technical there but yeah enzyme engineering is fun we do it do it pretty well okay yeah so and and I mean you can you can not answer if this is you know something that you shouldn't talk about but do you spend more or equal time messing with the enzymes in the pathway or have you also started looking at messing with the metabolism of the yeast generally and I this is definitely something we've touched on a little bit but like is like like is it a lot like do you really have to go in and seriously tweak the metabolism or do you more focus on just trying to make the enzymes themselves in in the pathway you care about better it's it's a bit of both and and a lot of like maybe crossover between the different teams that are working on this stuff I suppose yeah what should I say about this so actually I mean that do you have different teams in your company that like focus on the different aspects so like you know one group or some okay so you've got like a metabolism engineering group an enzyme engineering group that kind of thing and then presumably like process engineers and that sort of thing yeah yeah total okay cool how many people do you yeah how many people do you have working at your your company now like because I mean I know when it started there was like three or four you but like it's it's grown quite a bit yeah we were at about over 20 people leading into the month of March and then business is where I stood shut down and stuff and then we've made some like changes to our team since then I guess but that's uh yeah okay so but about about 30 people yeah actually that that brings up an interesting question how has the the the ye old plague affected your ability to do the thing like is it as it like interfere do the research has it interfered with production like how are you how are you handling that because this is I mean your your business is very different than like your average retail business but like it's got to have been affected so like how how has that been handled it's uh it's been okay actually I would say like so so I just thinking about something else for a second we it's been hard because like we're yeah we're kind of a smaller company that's funded from like investors and stuff like that and so a lot of like the support and a lot of like the the way the government was like funding things like you know sporting stuff wouldn't leave applied to us right away in the end you know we we we deal with money in the bank to kind of like lead through the stuff and still make some like really interesting achievements over the course of the past past few months but so I would say you know some hard stuff to deal with being a CEO at this time is like a pretty challenging kind of stressful thing anyway anyone yeah anyone be anyone beating companies through this this period is like under a lot of pressure but but as a whole I would say like we've handled things like reasonably well and and we're doing okay okay fair so actually I think this this actually leads into another interesting question you know let's let's fast forward a few years let's say you're already at at the point of scale and production and you know you've got a product on the market how differently would your company hold up in the case of you know a plague event or serious [ __ ] happening compared to like a more traditional farm like would you have an easier or more difficult time easier okay I would say I mean if you depending on them yeah hypothetical plague in the future like what the next one yeah how's it gonna transfer but I guess you if you think about like you know managing a production plant that does like he's manufacturing versus having to like you know trim cannabis flowers like there's there's interactions at that like you know you don't never have to touch the east if you're ever if you're doing this kind of manufacturing ever when it comes to doing doing this at large scales and so in that sense yeah any also doing you know need to as many staff to kind of run it like a big facility like that compared to you know the number of staff that need to like watch over the plants and make sure that they're all growing the right height and everything like that right so they I can think of all these different reasons why it might make more sense to in the future how's it become more automated right like I mean if you're if you're just processing yeast it's just liquid handling basically like yeah and so that's like right right I mean it's you're handling liquids and goo whereas if it's a if it's a traditional farm like someone has to harvest all the plants someone has to trim all the plants someone has to package all the plants and so it's also more hands-on especially in a the age of hey maybe you don't want to be touching things so you know maybe like at the end of your process it can be mostly automated and you just get like a 55-gallon drum worth of concentrate at the end versus when it's plants you still might get a 55-gallon drum and concentrate but there's a lot more people involved potentially right so that about sum that up yeah basically okay I mean one day we'll have robots that will farm all of our plants too and they maybe it doesn't matter anymore although yeah but farming robots are hard firming a robot very difficult and they're it's very expensive and I mean when you compare the the difficulty of a liquid handling robot on an industrial scale versus you know some robot that has to want like understand and interpret the shape of the plant as its trimming it and harvesting it and working that you know getting it's it's you know hokey bets up and up in the plants space like that is a much more difficult engineering challenge and and like even just computer science chomps like how do you teach a plant what a plant teach a [ __ ] teacher a robot what a plant is supposed to look like and all this kind of stuff and then you know properly interpret all the signals so that it handles it properly and have you know whatever grabby arm thing that you know it's it's a it's a more difficult challenge and it's more expensive and it's probably more parts whereas with your stuff because it's all just liquids like it's just you know turning valves and [ __ ] on and off they tank us up yeah yeah drains fast right like drain every drain into the ground we're being you to go right you know have that tank get hot that that tank is cold you know you know spin that one's a centrifuge that one's solvent you know whatever the case may be yeah that's very interesting so it's theoretically more robust so I think that's also an interesting prospect for both I mean other pharmaceuticals but also just whatever other end products and and cannabinoids and other things they end up making like it adds a layer of robustness in this in the face of the world shutting down which yeah and this is this is the heavy hitters of this in bio hype circle are all in favor of this kind of thing right we're like going good yeah grow yeast in space and then you can do it that way too right and then you have to that's just anything you want uses very true right plants do you look forward to one day sending some stuff up to the space station see if you can t need like a little like petite like you know you know they like the rackmount units they've got on the ISS you know it's like and this is our stove or oh yeah yeah you know do you imagine just having like an itty-bitty one and just like astronauts vaping in space like maybe nothing Esperanza vaping in space or something I don't know what the relevance of bad to you okay I wonder if there might be something there too if you ever wait six months you know in the void of space going to Mars yeah yeah that's something to do yeah somebody is somebody's butt actually bone bone development and degeneration maybe there's something related to the endocannabinoid system there so you might actually have a a therapeutic use okay but for science I like it no no it's your safety babe I mean maybe maybe the astronauts whether you want the video do they do they want this kind of thing up there do they even I don't know what it's like to anyways well cuz I mean they get like weird issues like co2 pockets so it's like if you'd end up like if you if you like hot box your corridor as quarters it just might just hang there okay that's so have you I mean this has really nothing to do with anything but like have you thought about the like the physics of growing pharmaceuticals in space cuz like you're like you know it's fine what it's a tank of liquid on earth like you've got gravity to hold your [ __ ] in place but like I feel like that would be a huge engineering challenge to make that work in in space like things would would slosh around and just float in weird like you'd have to like get the tube into like at the center of the liquid somehow it just did like I don't know it's just I think geometrically it would just be a very interesting a very interesting challenge to like deal with the fact that your liquids don't sink yeah I haven't I haven't really thought about it actually yeah yeah I mean that's fair although although there was I came pretty close to actually this it was a competition that that was gonna be related to some like getting our yeast strains into space as like a research experiment somehow anyway that was like a years ago that I'd tried to do this thing but there there is some interesting stuff when it comes to microgravity and yeast and other microbes and how they grow when else other stuff and I guess there's work to be done and interesting things that I guess all organisms kind of change whether you end up in that environment you know humans I mean it's a trash it also the radiation environment too so you'd have like this is something I've been thinking about like if you try and grow your pharmaceuticals in space like it's a heavier radiation environment you have a mutation it's gonna [ __ ] with your product so bad like it could like it could wreck your batch really really easily I mean there's been a lot of experiments where they try and grow bacteria in space and they get angry like they do not like it why they just they Butte ate really hard and have really nasty products are being produced and it's just it's very strange it's entertaining yeah it from like a from a science perspective it's fascinating but like I would not want to be the guy in charge of that oh man I have they done slime mold in space I feel like they did but also if they haven't they need to because that would be such an interest in your experiment yeah I wonder I haven't I haven't looked into it what else yeah space is weird space is weird stuff it's very weird I like the idea but I'll get there eventually but like yeah yeah I guess you gotta figure out I think so I still frozen at her waist I think moon is probably where a lot of this stuff is gonna end up happening uh yeah anyway cuz I mean that's that's like sorry like [ __ ] Mars thank you the the moon is where it's at and like I'm like I think Mars bases are stupid but I'm a huge fan of moon bases just because it's close and it's it's just a very fascinating thing but I I think you know I mean also there's enough gravity that like your liquids would still probably slosh around in really weird ways but there is still enough gravity that like a tank of liquid will settle and so like I think being able to grow pharmaceuticals in the way that you are will probably be very valuable technology on the moon I almost wonder if that's like because I know there's grants and stuff for for moon project I almost wonder if that's something that would be worth like you considering like if I need a grant all that means I'd be entertaining just like she very fun but III think like long-term like being able to because the only time like that sort of base would really be stable and viable long-term is when you can produce all your own stuff and like pharmaceuticals I think is gonna be one of the most difficult to produce because you know each pharmaceutical has its own quirks but I think you know if you had like a hundred tanks each one produced you had a yeast that produce some different useful thing like that seems like a really viable way of overcoming that problem in this because just cuz it'd be like technically easier than trying to do chemistry interface like well there was there was that I think it was craig Venter that was the one that kind of suggested like oh why don't you put like a DNA synthesis robot on the moon that just like spits out DNA and then you don't even have to have a yeast collection of these various type of DNA being synthesized in here yeah the presumably although that works [Laughter] I guess you could imagine that giving a a you know basic yeast strain and then you transfer me with different pieces of DNA and then depending on what you give it and then it'll it'll make a different public right and then you have to have a right in theory that sounds good but as someone who's actually done like a lot of you know toiled away at yeast transformations like it's not that easy it sounds really good on paper in practice you know but this is this is later in the future when we have a synthetic version of yeast and that actually takes a teenager yeah we yes sure first that and then make that you strain now can can I have it please I want magic yeast that makes my life easy [ __ ] I mean it like forget growing THC that would be way more valuable just magic east yeah make anything that'd be fun okay so let's let's see if there's if there's any other questions but and we've been going for two hours so like if you want to if you're ready to wrap it up we can do that let's just let's just see if there's any other interesting the question was really quick I'm just gonna like skim through so yeah you know it's if anybody's got like a you know a pressing question you know speak now or forever hold your peace we have you a minute or two just cuz I know there's lag on the stream so yeah if you've got some questions leave them in the comments and we will try and dress them but otherwise it's been fun I'm glad we finally I'm glad we finally did this this is things has been a really interesting conversation we got to cover some really interesting ground it seems people have been enjoying it so that's been good yeah I think it was I think there's a pretty significant lag on the stream so it's gonna take them a second to actually start sending some questions if they do that otherwise they're probably just gonna continue bickering amongst themselves as usually goes [Music] okay so there was one question on the stability and reproducibility versus like a cannabis monoculture it's like how's that comparable I mean I don't know that much about cannabis monoculture I would say but like I think like for yeast it's no problem that's easy you do it all the time like it's it's just part of the game for cannabis I think there's a more specific things that you have to do in order to get it - yeah grow consistently and to do that like you know for I guess you think you might be think about like 20 years that you're using this like it's same exact plant in the same exact way to make the same exact compounds for somebody to use for therapeutic whatever and that's I think you know some companies that are doing more the pharmaceutical aspect of this stuff are like you're working towards that or have spent a lot of time like mastering that one aspect of it like for in cannabis consistently and then but that was like I think that's a big challenge earlier on in Canada's industry and still is hard to get like you know uniformity across like every cannabis plant that you grow just about different different conditions that might tweak it a little bit I mean that makes sense Oh will you be doing an IP out like at some point are you looking at taking the company public are you gonna stay private for the foreseeable future yeah good question we'll see who's fair good yeah well when you do that is the question oh yeah yeah of course right a lot of I mean that's like the the whole sort of story right like what do you end up in future and it's like you know hopefully you you find a way to to keep to make the company exist and actually take it like in tests huge a successful thing and then you can decide if you want to sell it or if you want to be doing they don't want to take it public or whatever else right right yeah that's possible fair enough and this I I assume this is something that you'll only be able to be like yes or no but do you do computational analysis to predict the structure of better and more efficient enzymes I think when we talked on that we talked about this a little bit but like short answer is yes yeah but I guess generally speaking you know I did that did this work in my undergrad about like how to use computers to predict stuff with enzymes and it gets to be pretty I like despite many years of computational enzyme discovery in prediction and design whatever else I'll say that the results from computational predictions are like pretty limited yeah so so you know even the best people in the world at this science technology of like particularly protein structures are still still having a hard time with a lot of different cases right I mean that's that's sort of what I expected like do anyways yeah it's a cool topic I love it I love the topic of computation with that prediction that's super cool it is super cool it's just also enzymes are hard yeah and and all the things that we think will work don't often so like a lot of the time it's it's you know you know I've got this great idea and what if we just tweaked is one thing and or you but then you just like mutated randomly change something that makes no obvious sense to you and it just ends up working way better than like okay what right so it's like okay cool there's been a lot of questions like do you are there are there internship possibilities of your company and also like just asking about your hiring practices like are they mostly like PhD and master's student like or people with PhDs masters all sort of thing or do you have kind of more of a like a open range more more open range actually I think we've we've got like a good mix of things and and we don't necessarily you know I mean we have some philosophy where it's like we don't necessary want to hire a PhD to fill like an entry-level role of course that's gonna be more like a bachelor's or master's student that will fill those kinds of roles so you know every rule has its place and person has its place that accompany so I mean yeah that's fair enough but so you're more looking for like talent and skill set rather than like magical piece of paper I say it generally yes yeah I know that's where I'm all about it that's that's good [ __ ] okay that questions already been answered like a hundred times [Music] no okay I've not seen anything particularly interesting so I think we'll probably wrap it up there well either way thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun I know we were we've been trying to set this up for a little while so I'm glad we finally finally got it done it seems like people really enjoyed it and I mean I think we got to cover some really interesting ground I mean I learned some things this was this was really great so yeah thanks for thanks for hanging out cool yeah this is this as fun as a pleasure hopefully people learned something from this exchange here otherwise people if people have questions is there a spot that they can contact you or and do you have any other I mean there's the the hyacinth link in the description but is there anything else that you want to plug while you have the opportunity good question I don't think so I think just follow that link if you want to hang out with other people who like to do DIY bio stuff and and you can go check out Rico bio I guess that's pretty good bio and we'll I think the websites out of date now but he'll updated maybe and then even the future when people watch this they'll realize like oh yeah this is cool otherwise yeah nobody can send questions to you and I'll answer them through you maybe is it also another approach to that fair enough is there is there a contact page run on Python or is it there is but we're usually pretty slow to answer that just cuz like okay that's that's totally fair alright well thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun for the the regular viewers and the next stream should be on Monday I think we're just", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would up y'all there's a little bit of controversy on the

"-PQuHx-2yPI": "man what's up everybody welcome back to another episode of eos it's 1090 jake but i'm rocking with charlie y'all rocking with me and for this video we're going to be speaking on a philly comedian that was gunned down on instagram live on christmas eve now 2020 has been held for rappers with hip-hop taking major losses month after month and gun violence to blame more recently a young comedian coming out of philly was gunned down on christmas eve and the shooting was captured on instagram live woo biddy also known as skinny was walking the 1800 block of wine wood road in west philly's overbrook neighborhood when a man seen on video walked up with a gun out skinny can be heard exchanging words with the shooter it sounds as if he's speaking from behind a mask but you can hear him say what's up go ahead bro and you can even hear the shooter respond back saying sup skinny quickly said we are live and you can hear the panic in his voice as the shooter raised the gun what's up go ahead bro bro i'm live six shots can be heard on video while skinny falls to the ground on the side of 1871 wine wood road police found him lying in the grass shot multiple times to the chest and head and 15 minutes after the shooting skinny was pronounced dead at the hospital the four second video quickly spread through social media and was tied to chicago as skinny had made a video posting to his instagram story dissing chicago rapper fbg duck who was also killed this year 63rd street which is the street duck was from and tuka an associate of duck who was only 15 years old when he was killed in chicago nobody caught me nobody hit me up it's [ __ ] 63rd [ __ ] tooka [ __ ] duck [ __ ] autumn you already know full block [ __ ] you know long little grandson v-roy auntie roy and can't forget [ __ ] you first quarter i looked at this in an entirely different way than what was being portrayed by people online trying to pull views and attention skinny had posts on his instagram and was obviously a fan of chicago music but i've never heard of gangs in philly and i doubted he had any ties to the bd gd war in chicago not only that but skinny was from frankfurt a neighborhood in northeast philly where he graduated high school and played football before he even posted the chicago [ __ ] he said these west dudes want to be my ops man i only deal with frankfurt [ __ ] it don't involve me if it ain't frankfurt and when we shoot [ __ ] ass [ __ ] you can't ride when we shoot so obviously he has something going on in his own city and going on with west philly but still decided to walk through there not only that he's saying [ __ ] 63rd which many are assuming he's talking about fpg ducks block but to me it sounded as if he subliminally dissing someone else and it made sense when i peeked the map wyomwood road sits between 64th and 63rd and he got killed not even a block away from 63rd and i might just be overthinking it but to me it looks like he was sneak dissing whoever from the west decided to walk through 63rd taking a side street and was either recording a video on a zop's block or pulled out his phone when he got ran down on thinking recording the shooter was gonna save him from getting shot when you add all that up it doesn't sound like he was a random comedian that was killed it sounds like he was in some [ __ ] or was acting like it and fell victim now philly is known for not [ __ ] off only two hours after skinny was killed another 20 year old died after being shot five times in kensington and no arrests have been made in either shooting then christmas day a man opened fire on a crowd striking two teens in the neck killing one before he was shot to death by police again in the kensington neighborhood earlier this year in july another philly comedian named demetrius green more popularly known as ho died after a gunman walked up to the kyrie was in and opened fire at a red light the driver drove another 100 feet before crashing into a pole but 25 year old michi had been hit multiple times and didn't make it now the first thing that people need to understand about the streets regardless of the city you win bullets don't discriminate against anybody gangsters don't discriminate against anybody with this online generation with people seeing trolls like takashi 69 become famous off of trolling off of talking [ __ ] and then hiding behind the police you have comedians trolls fans everyone is getting into this act of feeling that social media is a bulletproof wall that they can act talk and portray themselves to be whatever they want to be on social media and that it won't come back to bite them in reality and i'm not saying that's the case for this kid he could have been living like that he could have not been living like that but whatever it is he had real beef and it turned into a real situation why the [ __ ] he went over to where he had a problem at without a gun i have no idea why he pulled out his phone i'm assuming he thought it was gonna save him he recorded his shooter you can see him you can see his [ __ ] face he doesn't have a mask on it's not the clearest video it's only like a second and a half i don't know if the police are gonna be able to tie that into anything regardless the shooter knew he was there however that played out i'm sure it'll come out with the investigation and he walked up on him and he gunned him the [ __ ] down and like i said i don't think this has anything to do with chicago i don't think he said [ __ ] duck and all the sudden gds appear out of nowhere and started shooting them that doesn't sound right to me it sounds like he was subliminally dissing 63rd in philly i don't know if that's a hood i don't know what it is but it makes sense to me and one of the first things i learned inside of prison is it doesn't matter how i carry myself it doesn't matter the energy i put out the respect that i give i have to learn how to react because it isn't me i have to worry about it's everyone else that's in here with me and i need to know how to move around them if i'm in a dorm full of killers i got to be on the same type of time that they're on if i want to survive it's the same [ __ ] [ __ ] in the street the streets ain't made for everybody that's why they got sidewalks that's a saying that they be trying to put out there you can get smacked to [ __ ] down on the sidewalk too if you ain't in that lifestyle i suggest you stay the [ __ ] away from it [ __ ] will be like oh he was lacking he didn't have a gun he didn't it don't even matter he shouldn't even have been over there never mind been there with a gun and doing all types of other [ __ ] he could have turned it around and killed the other person now he's going to [ __ ] prison the whole [ __ ] could have been avoided and hopefully y'all that watch these videos can apply the [ __ ] that we say into your [ __ ] life so you can avoid these situations but hey it's 10 90 jake i'm rocking with jolly i'll rock it with me till next time the frankfort high school football coach confirmed to us tonight that this was a former player of his and he says the shooting was caught on instagram live his players saw it and they are devastated this christmas eve kids lost a friend they lost their brother they lost the teammate he liked comedy you know just saying that's what he was interested in he liked making people laugh made me laugh he's a funny kid certainly didn't deserve to deserve this seisma is a beyond the field mentor and has been outspoken about gun violence impacting city youth and protecting players on and off the field especially during the pandemic when sports were not happening he lost another player 15 year old angelo walker over the summer and the city needs to come together elected officials everyday people and decide that this is enough and we we have to work together to keep our kids safe we have a responsibility to do that", "m6Kh4TE8YY0": "what is up you guys and welcome to my channel it is yourgromeach69 back at it again find him with a youtube video and disclaimer disclaimer review or talk about approximate apps if you don't like it you can do what now or if you're under 18 you can do what now get it kick rocks not smoke them phew so what's up welcome to my channel my name is michie michelle image69 upload on mondays wednesdays randomly on other days and do crappy comedy and i review and smoke tons of cannabis because i'm a medical canvas patient in also in the middle building a shipping container home with my fiance so if any of that's your bag subscribers to my channel assist and if you're new here welcome if you're all here welcome back and if you're hater well cause the rhythm is gonna get you what's up you guys happy monday i hope you guys had an awesome weekend um my i'm shooting this on friday i do have some really good plans so we'll see what happens there's that today's video i wanna talk i'm gonna i do have a product review we're gonna review and talk about it is a little late in the game but there's a reason for it i'm going to talk about the cure leaf sublingual tablets like kind of like their edibles and we're going to talk about youtube's new rules because boy oh boy there's gonna have to be some changes okay so uh first off let's go ahead and talk about these cure relief sublingual tablets as you can see i don't have any very many i think there there is 150 milligrams in this and there was 30 pieces so that's 5 milligrams per piece not enough for me but the difference okay so these are 45 you can get 150 milligrams i think it was or was it 100 milligrams for 25 at true leave there it's 10 milligrams a piece so you don't have to eat as much the reason um maybe some people would be interested in these would be because these are actually not considered an edible not by a cure relief so if you don't have your edible recommendation you can actually get these under sublingual if you have that route so that's the only bonus because if you can't get that route of administration one your doctor is a [ __ ] two there's these but i figured i'd give them a try so uh i got these and i could eat the whole bottle let's what's going on let's salvation time i don't even know what i'm eating this man i already said how about they're very gummy what flavor is this what i do like about these is it does tell you that it is a hybrid on here i think you can look up the other ones on true leaf and just check the site and that would work but they kind of have like a nutrasweet aftertaste what are these like nutrasweet i don't like nutrasweet did you see that oh [ __ ] come back again okay let's eat some more they have like a powdery stuff on them kind of powdery they're ashy like my elbows i'm like the only white girl i know while i'm colombia maybe that's why maybe it's because i'm latin oh no but i'm ashy as hell you let latin girls get ashy okay i don't know why i'm eating some of these that was just for sure cause uh pretty much these the effect on these i had to eat how many did i eat i i usual dose for me is like between 50 and 75 milligrams for edibles so if you're a micro doser and you were scared of the 10 milligrams you could try these i i just think that for the price you're better off getting the ones from truly honestly for the price you're just better off making your own let's be 100 but not everybody can do that and not everybody wants to do that and some people just don't give a [ __ ] so for you hey there's that in comparison i would go if i were to if i were to buy edibles again i would just go get the ones from true leave honestly for the price i mean it's you know i'd rather eat 10 milligrams and not five times and eat ten of these because that's what i would have to do at least you know what i mean why just eight how many i don't know i see them let's see six so will that be 10 20 30. see i'm only at 30 milligrams if i eat two more i actually just eat the whole thing that was make the rest of these actually a snack so they're not they taste kind of nutritious like a berryish oh are they arctic berries i also said these were arctic berry yes not very arctic very bearish anyhow let's talk about the changes in the youtube and what's going on so the dilio pickles they're coming down really hard on channels right now especially ones with cannabis content and other content like i guess someone related to which i don't understand because if you look in the youtube rules it says like i recently got almost a warning i almost got a strike on my channel i have zero strikes zero you know i've never violated community guidelines i'm you know trying to keep it that way because you know having a cannabis channel or anything cannabis related it's pretty much putting you at risk of getting god listen listen i don't know where you came from but you need to go back i hope you guys can see those flies and don't think i'm just [ __ ] crazier than i already am because there's lies anyhow a couple different things are like um so whenever i am doing a video that is say related to any of the brands that i speak with that i'm affiliated with i'm gonna have to start putting sponsor and affiliate and all that stuff which i always say affiliate links anyhow but i guess i'm gonna have to start like putting more stuff in more videos i didn't know that so i just want to make sure all my are crossed you know so i am going to be trying to maybe i don't tone down the titles of my video because it seemed to like get me as almost that's what got me the warning i think was the title of my video the other day i changed it and it was able to go back up so i don't know i don't know you guys all i know is i ain't trying to get a warning because if i get a warning or a strike i guess you can't post for a week so i mean if you don't see me posting for a week check my uh what is it called my community tab i don't even know if i could post on the community tab for a week or not i don't know follow me on instagram there's that so yeah you guys like whenever i do a new vape video or uh right now i guess with b nails or with true leave um because i am affiliated with those companies i do have to put some kind of disclaimer which i've already spoke of but i just have to make sure you guys know like sometimes you will see sponsored on the bottom of the video if a product i guess i'm trying to decide i don't know how i do it if it's a product list i don't know how it works i don't know if it's just that i'm affiliated with the brand if i have to put that but either way i am just trying to make sure i do all that stuff and it's correct okay so it's not like i'm over here trying to be like sponsored baller no i'm just trying to do the right thing and go by the guidelines like i told you guys before i'm in the influencer program at true leave i didn't know i mean i guess i have to state that in every [ __ ] video for true leave i guess from now on i don't know it's just weird and with new vape you know anytime i use their products you guys i do have to put down new vapes so i guess that makes sense and i guess now would be nails too huh well with that being said you can always save yourself money at new vape by using codemichi69 and also use that code uh b nails and get yourself some products you can save 20 over at b nails okay so i'll put those links in the description not sponsored this is affiliate all right guys so yeah i just you know i gotta you know shit's gonna be just a little bit different from now on i don't know i if you notice a little change in the situation that is why but i think we're done here are we done here i think we're done here if you made it all the way to the end of this video you're awesome please just drop a like be a dick face and drop a dick and if you're not subscribing to my channel this and hit that bell to get notified when i post", "yBBhoo0ZjzU": "well I'll begin by thanking Kevin and Doug and the organizers for the opportunity to speak it's nice to be back here I was at can med I guess a year and a half ago or something in Boston and it was a lot smaller than this so it's great to see the growth the growth in the cannabis area in general so we're switching gears from earlier talks which were focused on on humans and medicine and and disease states to the plant itself and so I've sort of tailored my talk to speak specifically about genomics I'm not going to talk too much about the plant other than to say you know this is an amazing organism that we're talking about with cannabis it's used it's has been used for thousands of years maybe going on 10,000 years by humans for very diverse purposes so there's no other plant species I think that humans sort of access widely that is both a source of food and the you know that pile of hemp seeds that I show on the slide source of fiber so there's bast fiber in the in the stems of cannabis that is very you know high tensile strength and used for clothing and fishnets and it's and of course it's a medicine because that's what we're talking about here today and by medicine I mean you know it can actually treat disease or alleviate disease but it's also a drug it's a social drug and the picture on the bottom left which I sort of scooped off a paper that Ethan Russo published a while ago is actually a shamans grave from western China think it's something like 2700 years ago that this individual was was buried with a whole bunch of grave Goods and something like 740 grams of dried cannabis flour so this is a you know a plant that humans have have already utilized going back that far for it's it's chemistry like THC and other cannabinoids so what my lab is done for for a while now is is really focused on cannabis as a producer of unusual chemicals so my my trajectory as a researcher was from trying to understand cannabinoid biosynthesis so the the biochemical pathways by which cannabinoids are formed actually I'll go back one and that led more and more to be involved in genomics and in in 2011 I was part of a Canadian team that published the first cannabis genome it was actually the first medicinal plant for which a genome was was known there was about 22 other plant genomes known at the time but these were things like weed and cotton and soybean etc cannabis was was really a medicine in it it's a genome that's pretty standard it's about 820 mega base pairs so not not huge but relatively complex and we actually sequenced a cultivar or what we were in the day calling a strain called purple cush that we we obtained the leaves for the the sequencing from a medical cannabis patient in Vancouver British Columbia who was growing it for himself so it wasn't you know a big sort of corporate Enterprise at the time and he gave or donated a handful of leaves that we isolated the DNA from so that has been an extremely successful project at the same time it's it's commits very incomplete the genome is fragmented it gave people the raw materials to do further analyses but it's certainly not finished but in in today's talk I'm gonna highlight a couple of areas that we've actually what we've used the genome for and I guess where I'm trying to go here is that you know sequencing a genome is one thing it churned out a bunch of data you make it available you you do a lot of computational work but it's really the raw materials for other science so one of the things the key one question number one that we tackle both with the genome and and before that was trying to figure out how cannabinoids and torpedo formed in the plant so this is you know how does THC acid or cannabidiol ik acid or Mir seen or beta carry awfully and on the terpene side how are they actually made what are the genes that control their production and the way we did that was was actually twofold one of them was one approach was to focus in on the plant structures that make cannabinoids so these are the glandular trichomes that are found on the female floral tissue so female flowers are the by the the flower that people smoke or extract they're rich in cannabinoids and the reason they're rich in cannabinoids is because cannabinoids are not just made in the leaves or in green material they're actually made in these little disks of cells that are underlying a resin droplet on the top of a tri coma trichome is like a microscopic hair I mean you can see it with your eyes but it looks like a little bit of a sort of shiny crystally thing on a plant surface we took those those cell types those specific cell types of trichomes and analyzed the gene expression in them using DNA sequencing technology that was available in the day and we were able together with a lot of classical biochemistry a lot of you know that sort of grunt work that grad students are in in the lab at midnight doing to really figure out all of the enzymes and the genes that encode those enzymes that are present in the cannabis genome so we from the sort of basic building blocks of plant metabolism down to the finished end products that an audience like attending can met here is interested in things like cannabidiol ik acid which is the precursor to CBD now we know how those are formed and that was really the power of genomics the in in particular cannabis chromatic acid CBCA which is on the bottom right of the of the slide there we actually didn't look at the trichomes we analyzed the genome in its entirety to find that enzyme so that was one sort of success story we similarly and I've heard that voice of the time limit the voice of God so many times I actually drop slides from my talk today but similarly we've done biochemical work using the purple cush genome to figure out how the terpenes for which cannabis is well known as well how the terpenes are formed what are the enzymes that make terpenes and we ended up having basically all of the metabolites that are labeled I'll not slide though the major cannabinoids like cannabidiol ik acid can bridge or aaalac acid THC acid can of achromatic acid and the Manger monoterpenes and these are the compounds that Ethan Russo was talking about well things like Betty carry awfully and mere scene and pining we have all of those enzymes and that's from genomics the other thing we did with our genome is is moved away from the biochemistry for which my lab was sort of established and really focused on the evolution of the plant what is the Jeannette genetic structure of cannabis and by genetic structure I mean what are the relationships amongst all these different types of cannabis that we have so we know that drug type cannabis and hemp are different I heard various conversations around CBD from hemp and CBD from cannabis it's the same plant it's the same species they're inter fertile so cannabis the drug form whether it's called marijuana or cannabis or drug type cannabis and hemp are grown and and really bred for different purposes so hemp is a source of those seeds and fiber for which I sort of showed in the first slide while marijuana or drug type cannabis is for the production of cannabinoids like THC and CBD but they're very they're very similar sort of morphologically certainly hemp is a lot more sort of scraggly looking plant if you drive past the hemp field and we have about a hundred thousand acres of hemp grown in Canada each year it's not as sort of pristine beautiful crop like you see in a modern medical cannabis production system but they're the same plant within drug type cannabis of course we have this sort of you know this canonical classification which I actually think is is is probably not that meaningful but the classification is that drug type cannabis is divided into indica style plants or type plants and sativa type plants indica type plants would be sort of shorter stockier broader leaflets and with a more of a sedative or sort of body stone versus sativa taller sort of lanky or more open flowering plant narrower leaflets and with a sort of stimulating or cerebral effect and this is what you know you're in a dispensary in Vancouver where I'm from or going online in California or wherever you are people classified drug type cannabis marijuana type cannabis into these types and they also describe a third type the hybrid the mix of the two so that that's sort of how we think about cannabis broadly and then of course we have this kind of this crazy chaotic world of cannabis strains or cultivars or chemo bars white widows Sour Diesel Jack Herer Kevin dog what-have-you these are these have been sort of I would say haphazardly named in many cases by the people who sprouted the seed or got a clone from their buddy and really enjoyed and gave it a new name so what we tried to do with our genomics work was used genotyping that is the ability to sort of analyze the the genetic differences between organisms using a scan sequencing technique so we didn't sequence every single piece of DNA in in the plants we we scan just sort of the sort of high points and we got 43 samples of DNA from from hemp types an eighty one drug type or marijuana type samples and we analyzed them using a technology called genotyping by sequencing and what this gave us was a dataset of about 14,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms or snips these would be individual genetic DNA code differences between those samples and this was in what I say we this was in collaboration with a population geneticist at Dalhousie University named Sean miles and then we crunch that data that oh really the problem moves away from a plant problem or DNA sequencing problem into a statistical problem and and what we used was or at least as we visualize the data here shown as a principal component analysis we found that there was one group that sort of upper right-hand group in green that was the heme type they were very broadly separated from drug type cannabis which suggests again you know they the banks he backs up what we already know they're grown for different purposes they might have even originated from different sort of gene pools but within the drug type we found some relationships but it was a sort of a larger more spread-out group and then when we dug in more closely what we were trying to do was correlate what we called the reported ancestry so the percentage of indica our percentage of sativa as described by the grower or the seed company that provided the sort the sample with what the genetic type said and the r-squared the correlation between reported ancestry and genotype was 0.36 so it's a you know low to moderate correlation in other words there wasn't a lot of evidence to support genetic differences between indicas and sativas as they were described by the people who grow those plants so I think what were what we're sort of exposing here is you know the inaccuracy of that indica sativa dichotomy but what I don't suggest is that it doesn't mean there's thought they're subject not subjective differences between cannabis types people clearly see that whether it's medical or recreational use and there are more sedative types and more stimulating types but it's just that the genetic identity and then the also the ability of the grower or the process or the dispensary to give you information around that is not not really unfirm footing so I'll go back one slide what's next for cannabis genomics I think what we're going to see now is a movement towards using genomics to fast-track breeding we've had this you know wonderful plant it's widely grown probably every continent I'm not sure about Antarctica but I'm sure someone has tried to to cultivate it there but it's been really kept out of labs you know in universities governments larger corporations its improvement has been limited to this sort of underground breeding world which has has to be applauded for its these amazing success in increasing THC levels and bringing CBD back but it hasn't solved some of the problems things like you know powdery mildew is a widespread fungal pathogen outdoors continues to be tchau in different latitudes really what we need is a genomics to accelerate crop improvement and so I just just to finish my talk I sort of highlight three areas where I think this kind of new wave of cannabis science driven by genomics is going to to move things along for our both our industry and for the use of cannabis one is its a potential resolution for this strain chaos problem in the sense that you know we need trust in the industry we need more predictable effects for patients and consumers we need a better understanding at a purely scientific level of how cannabis evolved so I think by applying more genetics getting more samples doing more in-depth analyses we're probably going to be able to link you know a name and I think humans are always going to want a name they're not going to want a list of chemicals they're gonna want a name you know whether we have Merlot grapes and we have Honey Crisp apples and we have Dalmatian dogs and we name those things and I think we're going to continue to name kanima's but we need some genetic identity that backs that up as I mentioned before genetic markers are going to accelerate breeding things like flowering traits disease resistant traits specialized chemistry's I heard th CV mentioned earlier CBG I mean we we want to drive towards breeding and providing plants that have chemistry that helps patients also has recreational properties that are desirable three minutes the last point and I think you know this is already being worked on in the industry is that you know we we have sort of generally sort of two tools or have had two tools in planned improvement one is traditional breeding the other is genetic modification now we have a sort of a third way which is genome editing that's using specialized and revolutionary techniques called CRISPR casts and related approaches to actually make changes in genomes whether it's an animal genome or a plant genome towards a desirable outcome and I think you know now cannabis is finally sort of coming out of the closet as an organism that that labs can work on we will see the application of this technology fairly soon is a GMO or not I mean the EU says one thing in North America says something else so it's a bit of a debate but I think this is coming as well and with that I'll end and there's time for questions I'll take some thanks there's microphones for questions in the front of the room please step up if you have a question yeah I think you need to go to the mic at the hi John thanks for coming today I wanted to find out more specifically what kind of markers what low sigh you are beginning to find disease resistance for instance and possibly the autoflowering traits one minute yeah so you know I partly now a lot of my work is more of a commercial nature so I'm sort of a bit hesitant to other than to say you know flowering time control is a key area that we're detecting in in our work and disease resistance specifically around botrytis and powdery mildew I think are huge drivers of crop maybe not lost but loss of value so we're working on those two as well actually there's no GMO I mean like but in terms of CRISPR I don't think it's GMO because the changes made those genome editing technique is the same thing that would happen naturally with with mutation or you could induce it with a chemical or radiation so I think it's safe to say it's not GMO in terms of the idea that we have GMO cannabis already there's no GMO cannabis I mean may exist the lab but it's not something that's that's out in the in the wild in terms of production or anything so I don't think we have to worry about that yet", "o4T2teLoKao": "dial-up gonna bring that round if not our King and our band Oh boom in young waste losing weight can you attend F kill you've got me Celia Bangkok bro [Music] this video two things one is 4:20 today I'm gonna try and get this video released today as well so if that is the case happy 4/20 everyone I hope you're having a good day getting nicely pleased and the second thing I want to say is and just to meet Friday even I'll probably say it a hundred times for the video it's a big block green circle fan UK dream team I'll type both they're like Instagram Kings in the comments you can go find them on Instagram yourselves as well but yeah that's you sadly this care package you sent me complete free so for us together did you don't you know big wolf to that go follow the minister Jam I probably say that a million times for this video but yeah just to start off that video I just wanted to say and make sure we've got those two points out the way one happy 4/20 to make sure you follow the green circle fab a new teacher in Keaney UK on Instagram let's big all done for this video young people was good pundits of course basically camera and over review as you can see we've got this super fire care package from green circle fam so what the edge sent is was a little sample of their GMO cookies a little sample of their it was a survey a GMO cookies pre-rolled and a mat qualms pre-rolled so treaty rolling of each as well what has made through all the dear local Keith we do so have a little bit of the max left job gaps acting i'ma split off as well and he also sent me a tropical island cookies pre-roll so what we get a sort of dude is do a proper review for the year Matt quadrant 3 mmm cookies as we got proper flour samples but I do what you ought to do Steve attract comical Sapiro second as well and but I mean I do just want to say there's tropic Isle of Capri accept me as I'll go into more detail with these two strains but the Tropicana cookie pre-roll is that me was absolutely fire I'm not a kind of cookies in a while I noticed reading that a lot of people do really like you say anyone that I enjoy the batch that they stabbed me in the pre-roll super tropical favor really throws you imagine me of like I don't that drink alcoholic drink or pessoa or whatever it's called order that kills and stores used to drink that when I was like getting pissed on parts when I start 14 or 15 and it just stinks or that noise that super like tropical flavor but like I say I have smelled that trouble comical keys pretty role now I was saving these to pre-rolls to do like a little 3k you know thanks to freak a little adventure video with another pretty role well smooth freaky roles as we go adventure but it is 4:20 today the day I'm recording this you know dead trying to put it out this video out today as well but it is actually 420 it's the morning right now for 20 and I'm thinking about treating my soft as gmail cookies and so maybe you have to judge mr. Nelson's old for that I've been to video I'm thinking about treat myself to this as a hospital with a flower but yeah anyway what would you probably go too far like say I'll get this Mac one out and then get some robot number to the pods just quickly that's a microphone I've got one look left of it I've seen the full videos of when we first got it in a second but this is just the last bit that I'm playing with now I'm bad gets all ground up Robin I speak spliff a bit so you've got a spliff dismayed quid oh it's a good it's a good it mother this is UK grown is that these are all UK code let's say sent to us by a green circle fan and the UK dream King UK to make sure you go follow them on Instagram you know big all them sometimes this care package so we could get a review I mean this Mac one which looks unreal do it like UK very my phone going absolutely crazy but yeah like I say what I'll do I get split all the part of this and then you can have a little looked at the year the map on flower and the GMO cookies flower forest mates all and we'll come back and give them a very proper review your people what is good to say we're back again obviously was something first I would looked at that's me sent this by UK Dream Team UK on Instagram or you could hit the green circle fan on Instagram so they you've sent as some GMO cookies I don't even see their as all but is the Funkmaster Flex court it's also sent as some magic wand caught and if also sent has free pre-rolls got a tropic article keys at GMO cookies and I'm like from a key role and so you have super gas really luckily I wasn't expecting all of this stuff they said they were going to send me some stuff to review this is what stirred up in the mail today super happy they like to say pre-rolls always come in handy so I've talked enough you know let's get to what you really want to see which is a flower I read about that logo as well really nice packaging I can say let's get to what you want to see which is the flower I think I'm gonna review both in one review the moment I think that's what I'm doing just cuz we've got a bit of a pity pipeline and there wasn't as much stuff on the pipe and I probably do two separate reviews I think just because we've got as busy a part line and I want to get this with you about as quickly as possible because they've been so kind to send me this stuff for free that air will probably keep it in one review and just review both products and the traffic light pre-roll or even all pre pre rolls or whatever so but yeah that's pretty let's get some funky flower open so I've just got them popped open and like to say on the left side because of the GMO cookies on the right hand side we do a Mac Quon ever loves did a pre roll sitting on a bag just before I show you these books properly I just want to say as well this is UK grown bored you know this isn't caddy board these guys have talked tally genetics and kind cuts you know this group wants to flex caught and they're the cat's caught off microphone and GMO are Italian courts of strains they've took them and they've grown them in the UK and I'm sure about to say they've done a smashing job of it look first at the GMO cookies see we got in there holding truck as you can see that straight away quite a weed no Street no structure GMO dust which is why I think a lot of people end up just pouring it into extracts and stuff because it doesn't quite have the broad strokes with 8-1 sometimes I'd be air in space but they have them quite a good job at this one yeah this is a nice dense bit I put a a really nice small hook as well you see it just I'll cover the trichomes the army straight away my gloves that covered it tracks damn looking super super nice Wow and maybe some of them very similar to the matter number eight by gas farms that like Carl icky skunky almost beef he saw a smell won't really say I'm picking up many of the sort of cookies icing it's more sort of the colleague sort of mushrooms onions that we just had associated with Geo may be there but damn nice on fire I've never actually smoked the GMO flour it's on super excited to try this they have tried the obviously extracts and bricks on most people after nowadays no super big and extract never tried the flour I am really excited so and luckily it's a wee wee looking dog boy it does have by the people you know it's it's nice and tight dense good colors running through it covered in trichomes it's a bit of a weird shape Nagpur dogs absolutely bang in absolutely bang in comedy trikes pop that one away so as you see that's the GMO cookies strong monster flex caught super fire big all UK dream team if you got green circle fan make sure you're giving them a follow on Instagram over this is the Mac one that he sent me again UK very micron which you know this from the looks of this it's ridiculous like wow solid little knobs these around pretty sure yeah sorry no no it's got one tiny one there she's covered attracts they are the real beauties absolutely covered really really nice purple bring through them completely covered in trichomes really nice and dense as well Wow smell Wow that's most what it smells then actually get the cookies coming from on that it's normal to me almost like a super like him like muted sort of sort of like orange cookies like I'll get the cookies I don't it's like tiny bit of orange on this match like that it's unreal wow that's really banging looks as odd on it really really nice uniform small buds god damn again you know just really easy UK grown buds you know this GMO cocaine this microphone here at UK very own real I don't see it unreal big up the UK dream team UK actually you can go follow them on Instagram also at green circle fan sending us these amazing samples make sure you hit them up on instagram at green circle firm at UK dreams in the UK GMO cookies actually I've never had it in Flour super excited to try it Mike one peep obviously smoked before but this was such a bangin sample of it I mean especially if you care I've never seen UK Mac looking quite that high that good I know some people do run I'm a kidney you came how to put some really good samples out I'm not trying knock anyone a no couple people do run it but little quietly on that level in the UK house absolutely buying it and then of course as well they've got the pre-rolls got a Mac one got the GMO cookies and the trap of conical keys he's just there Merc one UK go proper caddy coats you know absolutely sure that I can't tell you how much I mean this look is because I don't actually know you said it all to me for free so again big off the UK dream team UK green circle phone on Instagram make sure you go hit them up I say I certainly got some fire Wow looking forward to get smoking it's been quite a long will be up to two different flowers so yeah I guess will can come back with a property review let you know exactly what I'm thinking of it I'm just really excited I've got a say so people as you just see some real real nice samples of board obviously the map contacts caught looking at absolutely fire I mean looking at some caddy you know I actually had to message him and just say cloudy buddy know where they were sent me they just said they send me okay occasionally when I've got all this food I was super happy but I did actually message and just say you know this issue on UK brain store for you man like packaging caddy because this Mac one was just coming on real like super super fire sample luxe helps making the Mac one now you've just seen the bass the microphone and the GMO cookies at the tuner Mac home is definitely the better-looking what we probably would have suspected that anyway you know we've also made Mac nowadays or whatever for we all know it's got super strong genetics don't get me wrong this was a super fire batch you know it's not often you see Mac with as much cooler from it you know we still have to rely on Mac on the page which was unreal Tommy or even a little bit better than this but this is up there you know especially for you capable as well absolutely banging some of you people done the cherry stage has been crazy the G mmm cookies as well scoop master flex caught these will fire obviously not quite as good-looking as a Mac one that's still there done an absolutely smashing job in this and you know I don't know loads about very nice top tens know do but I do know that GMO is posting quite like a stretched fun and can be quite hard to keep you know control of and getting the good end product the people won so I think does a really good job with that GMO and I can't do no further than watch my bag appeal as in my home that's still a really nice little keyboard had its own living a beggar pian as well it did have you know college running through it is suddenly with a dinner you never seen for yourself it was still a nice looking board that's been growing really really well as a to some possible we have absolutely fire to get that up a bit deeper you know in deal to install in depth to it the Mac one had these a really nice sort of like funky cookies or turds to it when when I break it down I do get dislike what I saw got the same smell was there smoking on the nature boys Matt which is just like almost like plasticy sort orange juice sort of sort of smell is really hard to describe but I do actually pick that when I'm there when I'm grinding this bottle and then again when I'm smoking it it's sort of down the back end but say more is more than just that funky cookies again that really nice sort of funky cookie Mac hey we've you know context of growing levitate alive is you know some people don't write here don't think as much terms I'd quite like that sort of cookie taste that you get from it you know actually standing cookies a bit more funky a bit more sort of I don't know hard to describe what I enjoy it certainly some really good effect behind this one as well the GMO cookies was definitely a more different taste just only thing I found the channel has been similar to this GMO cookies actually the mat ate extract by gas farms it's super super like funky super light garlicky definitely pick up those sort of like beefy sort of tips as well almost quite musky it definitely a good smoke and definitely one I enjoy it sounds quite weird sort of saying this when you describe those terms as I'm musky install that they'd be something you enjoy but it definitely is something I enjoyed it's quite the more rich as well I could say I'm probably gonna smoke this GMO cookies or pre-roll today I'll be looking at anything here now I'm thinking I'm gonna jump on that today's it's 4/20 you know what's trying to save it what [ __ ] is 4/20 but you know I mean let's just enjoy ourselves I was a big old green circle fanfare for sending us these pre roles as well you know the Tropicana cookies Mac one and the vehicle keys hugely appreciative the genes they're all got I believe they've got 1.5 grams of flour because they're quite big pre-rolls and a choreographer week one or not I'm pretty sure we'd won and it was like 1.8 or someone finish it bad boy trick shot from the sides and then 1.5 grams of flour you know getting back to the flour though I have to say we do what the mac-10 cookies here I've already told you the Tropicana cookies pre-rolls fire ever came back to the actual flower like I say I think I probably prefer the Terps to the Mac one they're a little bit more subtle than the tips of the GMO I just think for me I really enjoy these Mac on tips and you know they're not crazy they're not you know madam your face and stuff but they are there and I do enjoy I think the GMO cookies I certainly enjoyed but think of a third it in like extract form because I have tried GMO native track form that once twice never had a proper bit bit to myself but I didn't I've got my cane I just become prefer them flavours and extract form they just come a little bit almost a little bit cleaner because I say these are some really nice and very examples I'm not knocking these samples I just think that extract version of German cookies I think I preferred a little bit more I bet if I mentioned this one everybody's orange tree review recently but that's definitely the same you know thing with that I preferred the orange tree extracts the badder than a did the actual flower but I think that's just the case that sometimes like I say this might quieter I do think is my favorite out the to do you think it's absolutely banger but that being said still redness GMO cookies and if I've been honest I actually think the Gmail cookies is probably stronger than the Mac pod they're both quite strong boards I do need to say that these samples both of them have been quite strong but I think when I was smoking these like the Mac we all expect it to be stronger I mean every sample of map you have is required from and if this definitely is but the geopolitical cues is just I don't know we just seem to do a bit more for me give me a bit more of a sore all over sort of heck I I felt the effect set in a bit heavier to know to me and I wasn't necessarily expecting that so definitely the geometric use was some fire I did think it had probably better effects that the to you know a bit stronger effects and stuff but I still think a winner out the tube is the Mac one I think he just looks a bit better I think I'm just in flower form certainly preferring these birds a little bit if we get down to giving error rate in I think I'm gonna give this GMO cookies here a nine-point free attend which so she's still really fire-rated in that don't you know if you've only watched a couple of the recent review so you have really high ratings don't get a twist that is ripped off a lot lower than like one point free not put fees are still super fine score we've had candy packs I haven't scored the highest off around really rating this I'd like I said I just think I prefer the church a bit more in extract form the night bond on the one hand I'm going to give this a nine point seven out of ten I think he's definitely worth worthy of that sort of high mark and absolutely banging for you keyboard again just perhaps you setting levels like I say I wasn't even sure when I first grabbed it was UK but it is and it's absolute folks banging I definitely smoke either the Mehcad like I say I've really enjoyed it both but the Mac one had enough to smoke again one of the probably the best sample of UK Mac just as I'm saying that trying to think off the top of head if I've had a better son Paul nothing's jumping out at me I hope that you can eMac that's probably sad maybe a little bit higher I just always think to that Mia died oh gee Mac also had some really funny - boys Mac which I think it gave like a nap instead of enough money or something like that but this is this is sitting up there with it I'd say this is the best UT Mac I've ever smoked or possibly ever seen as well like the absolute smash this one noxee I don't know son if I'm looking the GMO cookies I really enjoyed it probably just more tips in Hanks track form definitely enjoy the flour would like to say I am gonna probably smoke the tree make cookies but today as it's 4/20 I want to enjoy myself I was trying to save a bay for a little video I've got planned for this week but all guessed was Robin splitter something else I'll try and save the map on for them I do have another pre-roll so upstairs as well a Nature Boy pre-roll so we've got that as well I'll say if it's are free but I guess I'll just draw something off anyway I could say in free Lord green circle famine big octopus elves once again a huge Lord for sending this care package out to me some absolutely banging UK flowers for us to show on the channel and actually we never had GMO cookies on before so I'm glad to be able to show that certainly some fire you know I know a lot of people rate this as well and obviously certainly Gmail cookies as avoiding a proper school master flex court as well and then Mac one cap score we all know about it we've had on the channel before I think I've even had you came back on the channel I don't know if even port you came up on the channel before but I have smooth you know a good bit of some UK Mac and I'm saying it I think this is a better you came out of such mopes myself or even seen so Diggle yourselves green circle fan UK Dream Team UK like I say go for that instagramers all be in the description make sure you check them out still have these two pretty rolls Big Love happy 4/20 everyone likes a I will try and get this review out today so it's you know on the same day I've filmed it and but yeah big blows to everyone and like same worry about it more more comfortable for you you'll see", "Yh-LZV2tRgU": "I saw these news headlines a couple hours ago about people getting deathly sick off smoking marijuana and I thought to myself wow that's the first time ever but I've heard of someone getting deathly sick off of smoking marijuana and I'm willing to bet that those people getting sick off of marijuana they're probably smoking genetically modified marijuana see the government knows that thousands and hundreds of thousands of people are starting to figure out that cannabis oil can attack cancer and in many cases it can cure cancer there are thousands of testimonies of people being cured of cancer so the criminal government needs to step in and start producing contaminated marijuana genetically modified marijuana to prevent any kind of cancer cures check this out Monsanto creates first genetically modified strain of marijuana now why would they do that hmmm government controlled marijuana your government is lying to you about marijuana now I don't with smoked marijuana last time I smoked marijuana I don't know 25 years ago but I do know this if I ever got cancer I would definitely go find me a drug dealer pull out a thousand dollars and tell him here's a thousand bucks produce some black pure cannabis oil see there's something that you have to understand there is a deception people believe that CBD oil can somehow attack cancer or cure cancer and it's just not true it has to be pure marijuana that has THC and what this does when people put this in their body I heard it makes these cancer cells almost go crazy I don't know if they start committing suicide or they start eating each other but this cannabis oil this THC it does something to these cancer cells where they just go crazy now I myself I have a bottle of this in my kitchen it cost about 20 dollars or something but every now and then I'll just go take a pill they're like 500 milligrams this is the product very similar that was being sold at amazon.com about five or six years ago there were hundreds of these testimonies people were getting cured there was a lady that was sent home with stage 4 bone cancer to die and she just started doing a little research online bought some of these pills started taking one in the morning one in the evening a thousand milligrams a day and before long she started feeling better and within a month she could get around so she goes back to the hospital to take a blood test and found out that the cancer count in her bones had died off like 75% and then maybe a month later it was all dead eradicated now think about the joy that was going through that lady's mind her emotions but anyway amazon.com no longer sells any b-17 pills whatsoever all those testimonies all those comments they're all erased now what I do find so upsetting about this sickness going around I'm sure that these people that are smoking pot they probably have no idea that there is government modified marijuana that could be harmful to their bodies so anyway don't be deceived by the GMO of marijuana and yes there are thousands of testimonies of people being cured of cancer", "QjlAzBk5ZeM": "hey what's up youtube it's more kids are calling a brand new weed review video here guys good morning morning and it's actually perfect because i just woke up

gmo because there's like it's such a relaxing drive too by the way holy crap dude that was like probably some of the best driving i've ever done was on gmo this morning you know what i mean just

smells like [ __ ] [ __ ] and i was like thank you so much i just picked this up [Music] got my slide packed up with some gmo just got this brand new bong from cloud products figured we'll start the video off with a nice bong rip that shit's fire we're gonna be talking about gmo today i absolutely love this strain the first time i found out about it was in colorado and ever since then i've been such a big fan i always stock up on it when i see it at the dispensary typically you don't want anything that's grown with gmos but this is actually a good gmo this stands for garlic mushroom and onion so that probably gives you a good idea for the smell this strain is also known as garlic cookies it's a super unique strain and it's very popular most people are on the gmo bandwagon right now the hype is totally justifiable though just look at these buds the buds are multiple layers of green hints of purple in there too dark orange hairs and just layers upon layers of trichomes like this butt is so crystally just playing with it you'll have resin on your fingers you don't even have to break it up like it is so [ __ ] dank and the buds are all super small and dense and they're all shaped like thin and long they're not like big dense fluffy nuggets they're like almost kind of popcorny like i bought an entire ounce of this and this was the biggest nug i found in the entire thing a lot of the calyxes are like super beautiful and purple and there were so many calluxes in there i was actually able to pack an entire bowl of galaxies there's really no benefit to doing this but i feel like it has a nice asmr vibe to it there's no doubt that gmo is a super high quality strain however i did find a seed while i was breaking this up but that's something you can kind of blame on the grower more than the strain but this stuff has a very strong high i [ __ ] love it got another pool of the gmo packed and ready to go i've seriously been loving this new line of glass that called products dropped they have like five or six new pieces both of the ones that i'm smoking on this video are from them you can go to cloudproducts.com if you want to check them out let's just appreciate this function real quick gmo is an indica dominant hybrid it's a cross between girl scout cookies and chem dog which are two super popular strains which is another reason why this one's so popular i just love that gassy rank odor like well it's called gmo for a reason it has a straight up garlic mushroom and onion smell it is not something you'd think would be pleasant but for some reason with weed those weird ass smells just smell great it's definitely got a funk to it let me just warn you even before it's being smoked like i just cracked one of these jars the other day my girlfriend came in here she was like it smells like [ __ ] [ __ ] and i was like thank you so much i just picked this up there's something about weed that just makes something that's like rancid as hell that wouldn't be appealing to the news all of a sudden like a beautiful aroma have you ever driven past the dead skunk and been like damn did someone just spark up when you grind up gmo it hasn't even crazier scent it's like super super garlicky mixed with rotting fruit the scent of the strain is really what separates it from the rest the high is great too but there's no strain i've smelled quite like gmo let's finish this bowl up [Music] it really packs a punch the effects are like super euphoric and really last a long time this specific patch is running at about 30 thc which actually isn't too surprising for gmo i don't think i've ever seen it run below 25 i'm not somebody who buys weed based off the thc level but you're not gonna find gmo testing at a low thc percentage gmo definitely is the popcorn stamp of approval i highly recommend you checking out this strain if you ever see it at the dispensary we're gonna pack one more up and call this a video let me know which stream you guys want me to review next by the way gmo is definitely highly recommended [Music] that was nice and it really is a smooth strain but thank you guys so much for watching click like if you enjoyed this video you probably did if you made it this far subscribe for more videos i got a lot more on the way and don't forget leave a comment let me know what strain i should review next i'm sad i only have this much gmo left right now but thanks again so much for watching my name is jeff peace", "3vq6AKyIc5w": "right today we're taking down the GMO garlic mushroom and onions it's a hybrid between ken-doll of 91 and the forum cut Girl Scout cookies you'll notice a lot of purpling in the bud and in that purpling you'll see it because that is a reflection of the Girl Scout cookies this plan has been flowering for 72 days that are still white at the top but experience has shown me it's best to take it down no later than 72 days let's pan around this way you'll notice that I had to go to great effort to fit it under the light meantime it's a very big producer it's a tremendous indica it has tested as high as 38 percent and we enjoyed it very much it grows straight up it's a very difficult plant to try to bend and screen of green but you see we managed to do something similar right here so this is once again GMO cookies coming down to the a 72 days a lot of purple and a big-time indica", "pEeDA_v2I_A": "KPIX 5 has learned some pot from Bay Area dispensaries contains a powerful pesticide so toxic even the tobacco companies won't touch it only on 5 tonight Wilson Walker puts local pot to the test cannot tell by looking at your cannabis whether it's contaminated with pesticides residual solvents molds want to know exactly what's in your marijuana this particular instrument here is a liquid chromatograph just ask the team it's steep the labs we see that cannabis that comes to the lab is often would have to be destroyed in other states and that's because states like Oregon Washington Massachusetts in Colorado have either set limits on or bans certain pesticides for use on marijuana and tonight we're gonna focus on just one of them oh yeah so Michael butanol is is a fungicide it's for mildew molds and mildew my clue butanol often sold under the name Eagle 20 is approved for use on things like grapes and hops because if you happen to love it it's considered harmless but if you set fire to my club you'd know if you smoke it if you heat it it actually can produce a substance called hydrogen cyanide hydrogen cyanide is very toxic to humans that's exactly why the federal government prohibits the use of Eagle 20 on tobacco but remember California currently has no such pesticide rules when it comes to medical marijuana so yeah people have an expectation that the the stuff that they get at dispensaries are going to be safe and clean and well tested but the fact of the matter is that this is an unregulated environment up until now so how much Eagle 20 might you find on California's medical marijuana well we purchased samples from five different Bay Area dispensaries since not everyone gets their marijuana from a dispensary we also arranged for the acquisition of some marijuana sold on the street and we sent it all off to the lab only one of those six had no detectable pesticides that's right just one clean dispensary sample well three more had enough pestis test failures in Massachusetts or Nevada now our black-market sample it failed on nine different pesticide tests that's somewhat unusual to have that on one sample but if you're thinking the street weed was the dirtiest guess again because our last dispensary sample a product sold as medicine was far and away the most contaminated with Michael o butanol levels at more than 13 times the amount allowable under Oregon law the main ingredient Michael butanol of the Eagle 20 but now the clock is ticking for California to come up with its own safety standards what pesticides will be allowed at what levels and how will it all be tested for safe consumption there hasn't been the level of rigor applied to the industry that that's that's coming down the pike because as of now most of California's marijuana is being grown no questions asked the result is plenty of products you would probably rather not smoke yeah unfortunately without any regulations requiring testing it's you know purveyor whether they want to or not and it's basically a caveat emptor let the buyer beware is your pot making you ill for decades people have been smoking weed without any side effects but now people are coming down with CHS or extreme nausea and vomiting which turns out to be related to the cyanide growers are adding to the weed in states where pot is legal doctors are seeing an increase in a violent illness dr. Jon LaPook takes a look I thought I was dying for more than two years Lance Crowder was having severe abdominal pain and vomiting no local doctor could figure out why finally an emergency room physician in Indianapolis had an idea and the first question he asked as if I was taking hot showers to find relief when he asked me that question I basically fell into tears because I knew he had an answer the answer cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome or CHS it's caught it's caused by heavy long term use of various forms of marijuana for unclear reasons the nausea and vomiting are relieved by hot showers or baths the question remains why is this happening is it the nutrients growers are using the pesticides fungicides or other additives the answer is simple somebody is spiking the weed with a killer additive and it's now affecting millions of people nationwide and it sounds just like another chapter from the Georgia Guidestones like how they're spiking the food and water with harmful chemicals and now they're spiking the weed it's because THC activates the third eye in people's brains it opens up their minds to the corruption to the evil that's around them the system knows this and so they're spiking the weed to keep people asleep sounds rather perplexing doesn't it and while we don't recommend people smoke weed we know it's now being used to weed out the herd major corporations are supplying the additives and chemicals used to grow the weed and it's becoming a silent killer in its own right and it's being becoming a silent killer in its own right and it's being sprayed day and night even on cigarettes who's going to care if smokers are being poisoned if you're feeling the CHS the nausea and the like it isn't you it's the poisons being sprayed on the products you buy it's no different than the fruits and vegetables at the grocery store no different than the municipal water supply we need more transparency when it comes to the additives they're spraying on the products we buy help raise awareness like and share this video and if you're listening to this", "r0v_vafxZn4": "all right so let's see what the DDC smoking on here guys you can't sum over from

right on man looking good for sure that's one thing I saw somebody else doing a post they had grown the same strain out oh I forgot what it was but many times under HBS HID lighting right and then when they switched over to led the right men have really changed a lot of things like so it's pretty neat to see what we know quality light will bring to changing something that you're familiar with going under one source to another but this was good at dank Berk bud hashtag dude grows show and we got here sheer photons yeah look at that ninja fruit beautiful man or if you're like me I could say

house where the only hurts you see are the ones in the pots today I have an excellent video plan for you as we dive into the growers notes for the pineapple chunk run because that is correct as so the tips tricks and the lessons learned from growing this Barney's farm strain but before we get to it if you want to help grow this community don't forget to subscribe to this channel and don't forget to like the content unless we know that you're enjoying it LSD that 7 foot behemoth [Music] date this husband one of the fastest-growing strains that we've ever had in fact when this seed was freshly germinated a grew an inch in 24 hours we got it as a sample pack of one so it was all or nothing at just the two week mark the plant was moved to a solo cup with some seedling mix and around the 1 month mark it was moved outdoors to a fabric smart pot this was also the last time that this plant was indoors [Applause] honestly this is a pretty straightforward strain it took very little maintenance it grew out his best under full sunlight hot humidity and lots of rainwater fact this would be a strength I would highly recommend for beginners his six weeks into the vegetative cycle I was starting to get fan leaves that were bigger than my own hands fortunately I don't have any clips of this but one of the best selling points of this strain is the fact that it is so easy to clone and when I clone the strain I started to see roots within two to three weeks I only regret what this train is not immediately putting in a 20 gallon pot buzzer grew so rapidly it also became rebound quicker for that if you're going to grow the strain outdoors I recommend going straight to the 20 gallon and that brings us on over to the flower stage [Music] August and September was a really rough year for flowering plants outdoors there was a lot of rain and a lot of humidity and temperature fluctuations during this period and my other three outdoor plants all got powdery white mildew on them but not this one because it has a resistance to mildew about the lineage for this plant is cheese as skunk number one which are two very mildew resistant strains this will be an attribute when looking for seas for growing outdoors next year my only suggestion would be what I didn't do here is not clipping back the fan leaves any sooner this greatly helps the airflow around the plant and this also assists with the next stage harvesting and curing [Music] he'd write REM keyring method was used with all the branches from the pineapple chunk pair to other strains that we have dried these branches dried quite quickly after drying for just eight days they were trimmed up and then put on a drying rack for further floor making the total dry time from plant to dried flower only twelve days this is the 80% indica and a 20% sativa strain with a high CBD content when you smell this a smells like pine citrus and pineapple the highest best described as energizing of light euphoria and is great for those that use it for pain management you've made it this far in the video this marks the end and now it's time to hear from you leave me a comment below as to what your favorite pineapple strain is I hope this video helps you to make any judgments if you want to grow this strain or not until the next video I'll see you guys on the next one Tata for now [Music] [Applause]", "CURLtQPw9dQ": "yo yo yo yo yo so let's talk weed for a minute here let's talk we'd like my phone is almost out of battery so I hope it lasts but when it comes to like the POC community and I was one I was definitely one right a lot of the weed community I don't like to use labels I really don't everybody is just me and I am everything but a lot of the weed community right is hippies right like the quote-unquote like hippies right and a lot of these hippies as they are called you know they are just what they are but a lot of these hippies are offer the non-gmo and organic foods and you know trying to live holistically and minimalism they there are oh I don't we don't need anything in this world and we work we work to where we were working or were slaves and we don't leave but we don't really need anything and in all this and yet they smoked hybridized GMO weed that they slay for that they pay for that is completely unnecessary and is the complete opposite of living a minimalist life minimalism means you know living a lifestyle that you get what you need and nothing more you don't need weed I used to think that I did trust me I used to think that I did you don't it's a joke you don't need weed don't need any type of you don't it's just like bait like it's just like any other herb it's just like any other herb do you need basil can you live can you go a year without eating basil yes to nerve it's the same thing so and this was me too don't you know so don't it's take it all personal like that I was the same way I was like all towards the organic and being environmentally friendly and all these things first of all if you're environmentally friendly then why would you want to rip a plant out of the ground dry it and light it on fire and have the smoke going to the air you know let's let's really think about this and break it down it's all hybridized weed it's it's almost all of it is grown in a base unless you're from Cali or something I mean there's exceptions but even if it's even if it's not grown in the basement is still hybrid it's all it's all hybridized wheat it's not the weed that was here before we came is all hybridized it really is a drug now it really is a drug now because we've taken something and like isolated it and we've combined it and hybridized it and to make us something that is really not so you can't really talk that organic that organic [ __ ] or that that minimalist [ __ ] if you're smoking weed honestly you can't unless you're growing it yourself in your backyard and you're growing non hybridized weed that you know which who's doing that who you're not doing that you know once again don't take it personal this is how I used to think this is how I used to think now that now that I've become more mature for one you you don't need it that's the most like if there's anything that I could say you don't need it so you're you're you're you're going to work right compensating for the emotions that you give off that work for something that you don't even need in the first place and then you're gonna have to work more because you just bought this weed for 20 bucks 40 bucks whatever however much money it is you know and this is a never-ending cycle and you can't beyond that organic you can't be all talking all organic while you're smoking hybridized weed it's not it's not I've been getting the Sun element it's not getting the wind right it's not even getting real water or earth the soil the soil has been fertilized with on that god only know I'm sure why wouldn't him why wouldn't it be fertilized with like some garbage they don't give a [ __ ] about your look the corporation's care about one thing profits okay they don't care about consciousness they care about profits people that grow weed are gonna do whatever they can do to make it grow the fastest and get the most profits okay maybe there's a few people out there that really do it organically and they have a market for that but that the chin the chances are you're not getting it you're not getting that you're not getting that you're getting it from fake lights it's the same if you were to grow all your food in your basement if you grew all your food from fake lights from Miracle Grow dirt or whatever you know from tap water you think do you think the people put filters on these on there when they water their their weed plants they don't put filters on that [ __ ] you know they don't it's it's it's not natural it's not natural and that's the biggest thing that people say is it's natural how is it natural you tell me how growing wheat in a basement is natural growing weed in in a basement with fake lights with a fan that needs to blow wind around because there's no real wind like this you see this real wind okay what do plants need it needs it needs the four elements right earth wind water fire earth wind water fight it needs the four elements mmm the weed and that we're getting nowadays has all four of those elements are not there anymore the earth it meaning the soil is not the it's not the real soil it's not planted in in his natural environment right earth the wind the oxygen that's not even getting like real real oxygen you know it's getting it has a fan below you know the water is not filtered it's not coming it's not like coming from a cloud which is distilled water right and then the fire the the the Sun it's just getting fake like I lost it but um yeah it's that's really what it comes out to you can't be on that organic like that's great I think that's a great point of view to want everything organic but understand inter stand over stand that the weed is not organic nowadays even if it even if it is grown outside in the right soil and all that it's still hybrid hybrid meaning they take one plant and they fuse it with another plant its hybrid so man that's what it comes down to we're addicted to crystals at the end of the day and that's a whole nother that's a whole nother video but we're addicted to crystals we're addicted you're watching me through a crystal right now LCD screen a liquid crystal display we're addicted to these things salt sugar tea a she crystals the Internet crystals liquid crystal displace all crystals we are light we are I'm taking a deep yeah I'm taking a deep it's gotta go there we are light vibrating at a certain frequency what are crystals crystals are gateways of where light can travel through right so we either become crystallized or we come back to our true self and our true self doesn't need the crystals doesn't need the crystals really so yeah that's that's that's a whole video in itself but the point is is that you know I and I used to be that way I used to be so ah you know you eat organic food and you try to you try to be all healthy and live minimalist and and break away from the system and then yet you spend your paycheck on absolutely Burbage weed that was grown in a [ __ ] basement god only knows whose basement god only knows you don't know what they you don't know what kind of water they use what kind of soil they use they could have been they could be using pesticides herbicides and like and I used to even like you know I look into all my food and make sure all my food is good and I'd be getting filters from my water and doing all these things and then yeah I would go buy a bag of weed for $20 and smoke it into my lungs and not even think about it not ever think about it and yet yet it would yet I would wash my strawberries with vinegar or water to get to get rid of the pesticides but I would be smoking something that god only knows God only know so it's one you know and then once again you could eat it you could eat it that'd be the best way to do it I'd be the most natural way to do it make like a tea or something like that but that's still hybrid it's still hybridized weed if you can even find we visit hybridized I would be I'd be very surprised I really would cuz it's all tainted just like the food industry is tainted the weed industry is completely tainted so just a few thoughts from the brain just a few thoughts from the brain yeah what else can I say I don't know most people don't know I'm not saying you're a hypocrite because you probably don't even realize it I didn't even realize I was being so hypocritical I didn't even realize but it is it's hypocritical you know you can't be on that organic [ __ ] and then be consuming I mean smoke in general smoke in general is not healthy smoke walk into a burning building and breathe but there's a reason why you cough we're we're meant for oxygen alright so leave your comments subscribe for more leave me your feedback what do you think I mean you can disagree but what do you get what is there to say unless you're growing your own weed it's not hybridized and you're eating it and you're not eating it every single day and like you're not addicted then and you're treating it like any other herb which no one does so and and this video is for addiction anyway it's not for people that smoke once every you know once every year whatever so I'm a good video peace out", "7KI2RziFHc8": "[Music] welcome to weed entertainment and we're going to do it old school too look what i have got here this is a beautiful bud from northern emeralds and i'm not going to tell you what it is because today we're going to continue with the uh multi-strain cultivator reviews and this was oh was it my favorite you know what i think wait a second let me see what's going on here this is my second favorite oh yeah what am i gonna do so this was not the winner somehow i went for this play instead of the winner and i'm gonna leave it all in i don't change anything it is what it is right so this is the number two flower but i'm gonna talk about number one two this is the number two flip flower and there's a reason i pulled this out so anyway let me load my vapor cup straw real quick and then we're going to talk about northern emeralds a little bit and that's two scoops this flower is a little bit dry because it's old already and we're gonna stick this down into the vapor cup in a second we'll do it in a second and we're gonna start to talk about the northern emerald strains that i bought so i've been able to get three and i'm no expert on northern emeralds but if you go into the store and you see northern emeralds how do you know which one to buy so i've tried three and i'm going to give you my take on which one i like better and i'm looking for heavy flowers with focus that can grin me out and so we're going to start with the one i like the least and we're going to go to the one i like the best and coming in number three we have something called gmo cookies and this flower has 26 thc it's an indica hybrid and all these normal northern emerald flowers they all were bought at buds and roses in 2020 and this flower got a rating of an 8.5 which is an average top shelf flour this flour had a light weedy taste it was a little heady it had no focus you know other people might like it but for me it wasn't for me i just gave it an average rating of 8.5 but we're moving up to even better flower so this flower is actually the next one that i'm gonna put in and i'm gonna stick it in there because it's not the winner it's the number two and it's called grape thunder and this one the butt tender told me that grape thunder which is a hybrid and has 21 thc is a combo of atf which stands for alas alaskan thunder [ __ ] and grape strain and i don't know if i believe any of these combination things who knows what they it's just to make it up actually i think in the end of the day it is what people call it and uh but i'm going to give the information because i was told to me but i don't know that to be true and i picked this one to take you out with because this flower has a really nice grape taste so i wanted to go out with a little flavor today because i'm going to try a bunch of flowers today and so as i do these multi-strain reviews i don't have to worry about just doing the one flower i already know about these flowers so today i want to do a little bit of grape and so this is in the straw and we're going to go to number one it was uh again i rated this flower 8.5 just an average something something an average top cell flower so 8.5 8.5 and my favorite of all of them was something called titano g and this flower's got 23 thc it's an indica hybrid and you're not going to please this i gave this one an 8.52 it's a sweet og it had a clear head it was not pungent but all these flowers all of them were just average top shelf flowers for me i picked the grape strain because i feel like a little grape right now right so let's check it out great thunder by northern emeralds at a vapor cup at 330 degrees smoke ring wow two smoke rings in a row i can't even remember that ever happened before let's even get three so these reviews are done with respect to cultivators i

it's coming in at 21.7 percent that's nice so um you know so what we're gonna do here gonna pull some out we're gonna look at it and um you know my reviews our reviews for now i'm going to start going over like i think three things um the smell the taste and how it affects us and along with that of course we're going to talk about the dispensary it comes from and all that stuff but i think i should really start talking about those three main points so i can get give a good review to the viewers out there of how these strains actually are so we're opening this right now as you can see true leave here in florida dispensary medical dispensary need a medical marijuana card they keep their products sealed all right pretty good because you know no one's been in there no one's tampered with it or anything oh look at that looks like there's um two big buds in there look at that pull that down two big buds you see that pretty frosty right there this little piece just like fell off of it it's just like pulled apart it's like i like how it's fluffy not like a hard nug sometimes they use all these fertilizers and stuff and the way it makes the buds come out so she said she could smell it from over there oh yeah it actually does smell very fruity like berry yeah almost like strawberry so it looks beautiful there we go look at that i'm going to get a little more of a close-up on that and then we're going to actually pack a bowl so i'm going in deep sometimes the camera doesn't look too great but i think if everybody can see that with this lighting that's a beautiful shot of this bud frosty totally frosty check that out you know you want to see right there there oh yeah it's covered all right so we're going to pack a bowl see the bowls right there we got a close-up on that

to be do you guys hear this in the background so this stuff i got here it's called weed um it's good now this stuff a lot of times i'm not happy with the weed this looks like something homegrown by someone you know that grows a good so um we're gonna smoke a bowl here i'm gonna be a nice guy and give mary d the freshie stepped off camera for a second the freshie to the queen hmm i'm bad i didn't get much of a taste off that a little harsh well i don't think they name it after steve winwood because he smokes he stops smoking do you hear this folks so indica wynwood citrus og bybinsky type that in winwood citrus og i bet you something will come up [Music] tastes pretty strong didn't get much of a sweet sweet taste out of it but got a strong taste out of it which i would be hoping for that

comment below and if you haven't subscribed to the city media channel already subscribe for more peace love and happiness to everybody out there get high smoke poles", "eQ45FaTfXTs": "and just because the strain looks good doesn't mean it's gonna smoke good always remember that today i'm gonna be showing on a strain that's pretty new for me and i've never shared it on this channel before it's called chokey i just picked this up from one of the new grower processes they're called parea i already got a bowl packed up gonna be smoking out of my brand new mav beaker and this bong is nine millimeters thick so it's a good home defense weapon as well all right it's time for the christening [Applause] that was [ __ ] delicious first rip out of the new bong so far i like it but this brand perea's had a lot of hype around them and all the new strengths that they're bringing into the pennsylvania market but the only strain i'm gonna be talking about today is the shoki it's a cross between lime kush and gmo slash tk skunk two of my favorite strains are lime skunk and gmo so after looking at the lineage i was pretty confident i was gonna like this one it definitely lived up to the hype for me it instantly hit me with this lime smell followed by the gmo aroma that i just love so much those two scents might not sound appealing but personally just getting hit with that super sweet smell right away and then followed up with that rancidy garlicky smell just really caught me right away i'm a big fan of the smell with all the new strains and crosses constantly dropping sometimes it's hard to like pick a strain there's just too many options sometimes so most people just resort to looking at the thc percentage or whether it's an indica sativa or hybrid which is a fair rule of thumb but honestly that's not the best way to go to really maximize the experience you want out of cannabis in my opinion if you're struggling to decide between a couple strains you've never smoked before try to find their genetics and see if there's any strains in their genetics that you enjoy because if that strain is in this new strains lineage there's a good chance there's going to be some hints or some noticeability of that strain in it most people that like girl scout cookies like all girl scout cookies crosses because it has that resemblance of girl scout cookies to it so if you're in the legal market and really know what strange you're getting don't be afraid to like write them down and take note of the ones you like and try to find those strains and genetics of other strains in the future so before seeing smelling or smoking this strain i was pretty confident i was going to like it but that's not always the case and sometimes if you really just want to figure out if you like a strain get it and smoke it this [ __ ] is so smooth you guys i'm not kidding there's a little bit of lime flavor on the aftertaste too fern's pretty clean that bowl's not totally done but there's some white ash in there but it's really not rough on the lungs at all i'm gonna partially thank this bong i'm gonna be having these on my website and i was like it doesn't really feel right to not have one for myself so yeah so far so good i definitely [ __ ] with this piece and by the way my website is almost done you guys i'm gonna be having the most epic online glass website you've ever seen before and it's only gonna be getting bigger and bigger and bigger but it's gonna drop hopefully next week if you want to be the first one to find out though you can join my email newsletter i'm going to put a link at the top of this video if you want to check that out all i need is your email it's super simple and you'll be the first one to know my website is live but let's get back to the wheat these buds are super light green they're coated in trigrams there's dark red hairs that are bursting out of the buds which really give a nice contrast to that light green and it really just gives it a nice appeal there's hints of purple in the weed it's hidden but it's in there it's much closer to around the stem i found a couple purple calyxes but overall it's a light green color these buds have pretty nice structure to them nice small stem easy to break off you definitely want to make sure you pull out those stems though nobody wants to smoke a bowl that has a stem in it that's gonna make you cough your ass off but there's a lot of trichome coverage once you break into these buds like the more you break into it and the closer you look at it the more fire it really looks this weed wasn't trimmed the best so off first glance it might not look like amazing weed but the more i break into it i can just tell how fire it is my fingers are just covered in res as i broke it up with my hands and they're pretty dense buds they're not too dense where you can't break it up with your fingers easily but it's denser than it looks and they're nice super fresh buds i think they were cured very well let's do a little close-up focus there we go [Music] oh delicious really is a [ __ ] smooth hit and very sedative like definitely kicks my ass gets me super [ __ ] high and that's really what i'm looking for in weed it's a real stereotypical indica effect you just want to [ __ ] relax and chill definitely gives you that couch lock effect great for before bed you definitely don't need too much to get high on this one this honestly is everything i want in flour it's a great taste great effect a great smell and at first glance it really does not look like the craziest weed in the world but no one is going to smoke this weed and say it is not fire the stats don't really matter to me but it was testing about 24 thca i think the highest terpenes were caryophyllene mercene and limonene my one real complaint with this company is that they needed a better printer because like i cannot [ __ ] read that [ __ ] it's just like way too faded but the best part about this straight to me was the aroma the second i opened the jar i just got this rotten limey smell that i just could not get enough of it smells even better once you grind it up though i swear at first you get that like limey aroma then just smash you in the face with a skunky gmo stench that's just so fire where'd i go there i am holy [ __ ] that was a giant cloud huh i swear this [ __ ] reeks so much more after you smoke it like it has a real lingering scent to it but it's a super relaxing strain this jokey [ __ ] hits i really do like this strain my main and only complaint is the trimming but i really can't blame this company for not having the best trim on their first drop like i said they're brand new to the market so the people they hired as trimmers probably don't have too much experience so i really can't blame them that much i'm sure they'll get better at it and i might have gotten a little bit of a trimmier phenotype than some of the others that are out there because my buddy got the same strain as me from a different store and his just had no trim on it at all but like i said this is a brand new growing processor so they probably have four or five phenotypes of each of the new strains they have out and then from now on they'll find out which ones are the best and just focus on growing those ones and i've seen a couple people hate on these guys and this strain and it really just kind of cracks me up because those people are really just like showing their age in my opinion because it's like dude you guys probably don't even know what the word beasters means like if you guys think that this is mids like you guys are just so [ __ ] spoiled and have no idea what bad weed is and there's more to weed than it being in a mylar bag with the [ __ ] jungle boys logo or burner's [ __ ] face on it like there's a lot that actually goes into growing high quality cannabis and just because the strain looks good doesn't mean it's gonna smoke good always remember that i've had a lot of beautiful [ __ ] straights that don't get me high at all and a lot of beautiful strains that don't smoke good at all or don't smell good at all this checks off all of the marks and i honestly think it looks pretty good too so i don't really get why anyone is really hating on them super hard but they've also been getting a lot of love they're just the brand new brand so everybody's talking about him right now in pennsylvania at least if you're not a pa med patient you probably don't even know about these guys but i'd definitely consider this some fireweed i don't think it's my new favorite but a cross between two of my favorites it's definitely gonna be a strain that i like i don't know why but i was smoking a lot more flour recently so i'm probably gonna do a couple more flower reviews just because i've been buying a lot of flour and i've really been enjoying just indulging in flour so i hope you've been enjoying the flower reviews definitely still gonna be doing some dab videos and cart videos and everything like that but i've really been enjoying just like delving into one strain at a time right now so let me know if there's any strains that you want me to do a review of in the comments down below i got a couple on my list but i'm always down to hear your suggestions oh my god oh that was fire i really like the function of this

guys thank you so much for watching my name is jeff peace", "oOmgGnOc1NI": "what's going on why be TV this right here it's gonna be a funny blog to me but it might not be funny to you yesterday I've seen the post on Facebook and it actually struck a chord with me and one by reputable source it was bad I forgot that the website it was on but they say that my second toe is about to get into the marijuana business now for all the people who's not familiar with Monsanto Masson toe is a humongous company that's we're [ __ ] over all our food what they do is they they uh they pretty much is the people who deal with the GMOs Jim always is genetically Marchak modified organisms like they might take an apple and then take the DNA of an apple splice it with some other [ __ ] to make the Apple be able to take more of the kid this chemical called roundup so that's why I store organic to get the [ __ ] away from that [ __ ] so now what they're about to start doing is taking the DNA of marijuana and being able to splice it and that way they could produce it for a lot cheaper so guess what [ __ ] about to start doing you all got to start smoking Organic weed I don't smoke weed not a fan of it don't really care for myself but I bought [ __ ] you not I don't know what's the side effects gonna be see well marijuana it gets you high and you automatically feel the effects of it right after you do it and you do it further effects up so when y'all start getting them crazy highs and [ __ ] well you know I'm saying you have an imaginary dreams and [ __ ] that your whole [ __ ] midsection on fire the GMOs this [ __ ] is about to be amazing and it might not be a reputable source but the thing is is it makes too much sense marijuana is like a high seller like the [ __ ] was grossing so much money in the first thing they legalize it anything they say attacks us more we make it too much goddamn money we need more taxes so the [ __ ] make crazy money and then it stays like Colorado you know I'm saying I think California or again they makin a [ __ ] legal all the way around if I'm not mistaken I know Michigan certain parts of Michigan or the whole state of Michigan marijuana is legal for for you know personal use the amazing part is when Monsanto Misato got so much [ __ ] power if you look it up Monsanto got so much [ __ ] power in the White House that as soon as they do that I bet you that should go legal in all 50 states and the awesome part is that's when you're gonna see the first perfect person pop out and say they got counsel from smoking marijuana soon as we get away from what's natural and start man touching that [ __ ] that's when it starts to be dangerous so I'm just giving you the heads-up to all your weed smokers be careful dinner [ __ ] cuz mica Saito is coming for your lap if you don't want to end up in a box think outside of it why be take a letter kill or dry lot of dress you just being yourself is the definition", "ff1Dl2jLDWU": "[Music] [Music] what's good y'all thank you guys for tuning in for another episode of strand tasters cannabis reviews I see quite a lot of cookies and we're reviewing some real good today from subdued excitement subjects based out of Washington here this is the GMO crusher and I gotta say you know I like it you know it's not it's not really in my wheelhouse being a GM of GMO staining for garlic mushroom onion I'm not really that's not really what it tastes like but it is very good it takes good it's its old weed - it was harvested in March but it still tastes fresh which is [ __ ] kind of surprising to me a little bit about the genetics of GMO crasher I couldn't find anything on seven excited about GMO crusher or any of the clubs that carry it for the genetics but what I'm hearing is GMO crusher shows a cross of GMO cookies and wedding crashers that makes it a super indica dominant hybrid here on the chart says indica dominant 70% indica 30% sativa so that's you know right in my wheelhouse there as far as much as a indicas I like got a nice little joint rode up today sided straight from the blunt cuz I wanted to really taste this [ __ ] man cuz it was it was fresh and when I seen how the harvest date was a couple months ago a few months ago should [ __ ] I was like okay let me smoke this and joint so I can really try to taste what the flavor is it definitely has a GMO flavor and wedding crashers it's you know that's super earthy - so I'm getting that from this I taste a super earthiness I do have some like slight smokiness which is probably something to do with the onion or mushroom aspect of the GMO well yeah it's definitely got like a earthy funkiness that's not really what I like to be honest you know I'll say that unbiased ly just cuz it's not what I like doesn't mean it's not chronic yeah it smells super fresh it smells super good blood super dense soup or purple buds [ __ ] dark purple look and actually like vibrant purple one getting to it but frosted [ __ ] purple nugs it's super good man I'm pretty pleased with it I got this for about forty five dollars and eight so it's not one of your like cheaper side it's more towards the expensive side of eighths but I mean it's fire if you're somebody who likes GMO I would highly recommend this to you because a lot of my friends they do like GMO they're always raving about other smoke and GMO and Suge then I'm just like yeah looking for the gelato the runts and the skittles but it doesn't mean that it's not good weed it's powerful indica it's got me high it's got a good earthiness good skunk enos to it yeah I mean I like the more sweet gas but it's still fire I'll probably give this like a 8.0 8.1 yeah it doesn't give it a solid eight just to be solid with just a solid 8.0 solid a point oh I like that [ __ ] and I smoke a joint in a minute really like it's kind of refreshing to smoke up smooth joint I put a click touch I didn't put a freaking crutch in there so now it's gonna get all sticky at the end but hey yeah man shout out subdued excitement we had a done I 95 cookies review there's a while back she's fired to check out everything from subdued excitement if they're to have it available where you're at I know I was talking to somebody on the histogram saying that it wasn't really available out there suffix if you're watching me and spread that distribution that people want it so yeah man shout out

just curious come to see us girl Oh Tom Welsh is a third-generation dairy farmer in the rung Attica his family have farmed this land for over 90 years he's ugly and she yeah on the truck tomorrow no not tomorrow she's like I heard that yeah sod that's a reality you know one day you got a chopper head off well hmm it is just lost but just the mess and dust realization of it well yeah and it's this conscience which is now leading him down a very different path away from deer Eve and into the budding world of farming and the Welsh family have planted four hectares a pimp for the first trial it's a game-changer after long hours and high demands of Deering their bureaucracy and I know that sounds funny when you look at the bureaucracy that we're standing in here but but look at us we're doing it for much of the 20th century hemp was associated with the illegal drug cannabis which contains the psychoactive drug THC but more recently regulations have eased although heat plantations must still not be visible from the road anyone can grow him as long as the Ministry of Health is happy that you qualify for a license and that you're not going to be an issue drug wise oh here comes they'll men here and everything Tom's dead Stuart a longtime dairy farmer is well aware of the remarkable at likeness between hemp and the highly illegal cannabis I've seen her on t-shirts for so long now we're looking at the real thing you're such we would look exactly the same as the bed runner but this is a good one the reality is there's nothing wrong with the leaf you know there's no reason why that why anybody couldn't own that or have it what's it going to do it's not a drug I guess I having a pine cone next year boy what's what's the difference it's ridiculous you're not even allowed to use the hemp leaf as if it adds advertising on our products I mean the laws need changing they're changing slowly I think what we've got this current government and they might need to dip up to the plate and broaden broad anyone's thinking you know hemp is also a superfood with more omega-3 than tuna more protein and iron and steak and more fiber than oats it can also be used to produce a range of products such as textiles building material food and personal hygiene products I think we're only scratching the surface of what we can do with him and in fact what we may be forced to do with the likes of hemp and other crops in the future once the crop is a hundred and thirty days old and over two meters tall it will be ready to harvest for its seeds welcome the family have built pissing in cellar rooms and once the cps arrives from China they hope to pump out 600 litres of hemp oil and 1 tonne of hemp flour from the byproduct the oil can be used in various foods from smoothies to cellar dressings to a dietary supplement currently hemp oil retails around $80 per litre at health food shops and it's a growing business for the family along with pumpkin seeds and the traditional Deary a year ago I would have known nothing about him I would never have thought of growing it or anything so it's just one of those things I think we sort of looked around a few other things we could grow

baby", "tfifh1KKdFU": "[Music] today we're going to do a multi string review about insane and insane as dr. green thumbs house brand and it's supported by be real and be real surely noses flowers you can see them on Instagram every day and I would say my experience tells me that of all the flowers I bought which is a thousand plus that insane flowers have generally the highest THC of all the flowers but it's not just about the THC but I think that's notable you know he's out there searching for these high THC hours high THC flowers to put under his brand and I think that's really something so today we're gonna i've been able to collect up 25 insane strains and I'm gonna put them in the order that I think my favorite - my least favorite and we're gonna stuff course start with the least favorite in the end we're gonna go out with a paper cup hit of my favorite string and it's gonna be just glorious so coming in at number 25 and my least favorite insane string is ice cream cake and this flower has 22 percent THC and it's an indica hybrid I saw this on the Instagram feed and I went down and I got it and then in the end I thought this was a kind of a rough flower out of the vapor Cup I'm not sure if this is an indoor and outdoor flower but it bakes like outdoor flower and it got number 25 but we're moving on up and coming in at number 24 we have an indica called plum loco this flower has 18 percent THC and the flavor of this actually is okay but the something-something is just okay there's other insane flowers better than this and it's not that this isn't good but if you're looking for the best and they have a whole store full of insane flowers why don't when you want to go for the better one so coming in at number four plumb Loco and indica and we're moving on up and at number 23 we have a flower called the Lebowski this flower has 21% THC it's a hybrid and most of these flowers came from dr. green thumbs and some are we appreciate that store they really if you want to just pick blind that's the story you can have the good blood tender that can help pick good flowers for you but if you want to know which one's the best insane flower you should watch this video and coming in at number 23 is the Lebowski but we're moving on up and at number 22 we have a flower called Dublin and Dublin is 24% THC and it's a hybrid we're moving on up to number 23 and number 23 excuse me number 21 we have insane tangey cookies and tangi cookies is a good strain but there's other strains that I tried from insane that we're better than this one that's why this one got number 21 but we're moving on up to number 20 and a number 20 we have something called UK cheese and I love the cheese but this one number 20 and it's got 24 percent THC and it's a hybrid and we're moving on up so coming in at number 19 number 19 we have insane 13 this flower is 19% THC and it's an indica and this was recommended to me but when I got it I would say this wasn't one of the best insane flowers and the first insane flower ever got oh we're gonna talk about that later because it was the best one and that's when really the bud tenders in the know but anyway insane number 13 number 19 and we're gonna move up to number 18 and at number 18 we have insane fuel this flower has 24 percent THC and it's a hybrid we're moving up again to number 17 number 17 we have a flower called GMO this is an 18% flower and it's an indica but we're moving on up to number 16 number 16 we have a flower called nectarine lime this is a heavy-hitting flower 31 percent THC it's a hybrid but you can see it only got number 16 it's not about just the THC it's about how the THC works with the CBD and all the other factors that go into this just incredible number 16 uh nocturne lime excuse me nectarine lime number 16 we're moving on up to number 15 number 15 one of my favorites is Jack Herer is a strain this was a good flower and I bought it a few times and what what stood out about this flower is some of the batches were super good and some of them not so super good because I actually bought this and I gifted it and when I bought the sample it was really good but the next batch is they just okay this flower got number 15 it's a 19 percent THC flower and it's a sativa but we're moving on up to number 14 and at number 14 we have insane flow this flower is 18 percent THC and it's a sativa hybrid coming in at number 13 we have sunset sherbert this is a 27% flower it's a hybrid I like this flower I thought it was good number 13 sunset sherbert but we're moving on up and coming in at number 12 we have insane punch and this flower has 29 percent THC and it's a hybrid and I got this flower at cookies Melrose so I got all these flowers really insane excuse me dr. green thumbs in Sylmar except for this one and when I went down there they said this was one of the strongest flowers I had so I tried it it was a good one I liked in st. bunch it's a good one coming in number 12 but we're moving on up to number 11 and at number 11 we have insane cush mints and this flower has 32 percent THC it's just a Tifa hybrid and you see it got number 11 it's not about the high THC but you could see insane has a lot of flowers mid 30s and that's rare in today's market you got to be a good grower you got it at least know who the good growers are but we're moving on up and coming at number 10 so we've made it to the top 10 and these Runaways are getting stronger and stronger and once we get to the top five these are killer flowers so coming in at number 10 we have insane lemon mints and this flower has 30% THC and it's an indica hybrid you can see how many 30 percent THC flowers it's unbelievable it's so hard to do oh my goodness so coming in at number 9 we have something called forbidden fruit and this flower is 18% it's an indica hybrid and this is one of those flowers that one of the followers actually said that you try this and I went into the store and I grabbed it because someone asked me to grab it and when I saw was an 18% flower I'm like I don't know but this flower was really good and I gave it to nine and that's hard to get on an 18% flower I think this is one of the lowest tha flowers that got the nine forbidden fruit and saying it's a good one and it comes in number nine but we're moving on up and coming in at number eight we have a flower called blueberry yum-yum and this flower was great if I haven't had in the store lately but it was a good one and it's 20 percent THC and it's a hybrid and we're moving on up to number seven and in number seven this was part of the last drop and this was one of the is for me it was the best flower of the last drop something called butter cake and this flower has 27 percent THC and it's indica and it was a heavy good flower I like butter cake it it still may be in the store so if you want to try a butter cake it's a good one but we're moving on up so number six we have something called insane blueprint and this flower has 31 percent THC in it sativa and this is a good one - I bought this a few times this is a good flower if you see blueprints definitely worth to try a 31 percent THC coming in at number 6 blueprint but we're moving on up and in number 5 you're gonna see we have insane mac 11 and mac is one of my favorite strains not that all the master could because it's not there's some macs that are through the roof and mac 11 is really good and it got number 5 out of all my favorite insane strains this flower has 24 percent THC and it's a hybrid and this is a good one to try if you see it I've only seen it in the store one time but it's a good one but we're moving up and we're getting even heavier coming in number 4 is insane Hawaiian runts and this flower only 22 percent THC but it's even too heavy for me I didn't really thought I didn't like this flower it's it's it's not what I would consider my favorite flower and you see it's not on my favorite flowers list but it is on my longest flowers list so if you're looking for the super strong Hawaiian runts is as strong as it gets then dr. green thumbs it's a hybrid flower only 22 percent THC and it will knock you on your ass but we're moving on up to the top three so we're gonna stick this straw in the vapor cup we're gonna put a little flower in it we've got a little in there we're gonna add a little bit more in right we're gonna plunge when we're gonna stick this thing right down into the cup this thing takes about a minute and a half to work but this vapor cup is unbelievable what it does is it actually releases the water vapor from the flower so when you draw on it you're only getting water out of the flower it's completely natural and I'm telling you the flavor is the root or roof it is awesome but let's get to number three and number three 33 percent THC flower called insane gaudy this is a hybrid flower and you can see how many 30 percent THC flowers and st. has this is a good one and the flavor is really good if you see insane gaudy it's a good one I've seen it in the store only twice definitely worth the try insane gaudy 30 30 percent THC number three so we're down to our last two and these two didn't change from the last time so come number one and number two they could be go back and forth whoever is picking they're both really good flowers but I put it in my order so coming in at number 2 we have insane Oh G and this one 31 percent THC and it's indica and this is a super good Oh G one thing I will say because I've tried this a few times too they're all good but every once in a while a insane Oh G is insanely good and I would say I kept the insane good one this is a great flower if you see you I actually it's in the stores right now if you if you want to try and say no G you can get it right now it's in dr. green thumbs right now 31 4c 31 percent THC and number two but we're moving on up number one my favorite it's on our top 10 list of my favorite flowers - of all the flowers but for insane the number one flower that I picked to be their best strain is California cherries and California cherries has 30% tea see and it's an indica hybrid and what makes insane and this whole experience so unique is this was the very first insane flower I ever tried from dr. green thumbs the first visit I walked in there and they gave me this and I walked out got home and I'm like oh my goodness this thing is through the roof if you haven't tried insane California cherries it's a winner it's a top-ten flower in LA I really like that flower I'd like to thank be real and insane for making such great flowers for us you know we live in an experience most people dream of I can remember going back 15 years having to look for a guy to look for a guy to look for a guy

episode of strain kane as my name is Rizla and this is weed TV and what is it what episode we got what are we doing today it's a weave you oh my gosh how long has it been peeps as since we did a weave you I can't remember quite a few months ago they are back and what are we reviewing we're gonna go back to one of the original flavors the strain that we reviewed at the very start of our series of weed view the first episode was super Lemon Haze we've got some more lemon you know what lemon lemon lemon what the hell why am i review in lemon everyone knows about my views on lemon I've been scarred more or less for life from a lever for lemon for just for my area my ends supplying lemon left right and center it not being on point or it's just after well and if it is on points the same strain over and over again just like the cheese wrapping with cheese cheese sort of come back to me recently and now lemon strain is coming back to me so come join me I got a war I've got this one cause it isn't the strain I want other here we go so come join me guys we're gonna be a reviewing on today's we've you for shrink a knows strawberry lemonade sweet tangy fizzy what is going on we're gonna be reviewing it in four different categories one be in the sights why not be in the smell why not being the taste and most important of all the effects now that is the first time you've seen a string canners and you're not even subscribed yet well if you have seen us before you're not subscribed then please hit that sub button now there's somewhere and you want you liked the video actually you know what don't like the video yet wait you've seen the whole review and then like the view but if you want the victim in there nothing like it anyway enough of that sure so we are reviewing a strawberry lemonade it was in one big nugget I did take some pictures and some videos of this earlier and I wanted to go inside so it has been split but it was one big bud now I'm sure if you've seen at many of the we view series before you will know full well that they have sometimes that the bud gets a very very small I am smoking it down to the smallest part that I could possibly do and still do review no no no no it's a big bit on here guys this is nice and fresh and oh being is fresh so let's talk about some of the history first some of the info some of the background info on this why is it called strawberry lemonade so where does it come from what are the father and mother strains who made love and made this beautiful beautiful specimen of a son of a - I don't know look below yes so it comes from Strawberry Cough and that's controversial because registry of control do you know where it comes from if you do no wish to every cop comes from please hit me in the comment section please let me know I love to know where it comes from oh yes strawberry coffee and I'm so crossing the lemon og cush or I even sour lemon og cush I've read a few different things coming from Barney's at Farm Barney's and yes so they've come up with this one no but there was a common one in 2015 for best country since heave a concentrate in High Times Denver 2015 cup for best concentrate don't know if it's one any other cups I couldn't find any other information about it and what I do know about this is i I'm more of an indica person oh my gosh how I've enjoyed smoking this for the last week more as the last week on the smokiness I really have especially morning day times it has been perfect perfect perfect smoke this is it looks gorgeous I'm gonna get into the categories again guys and I will score room out of five even doing half seventy four and a half to three and a half million two and a half and then we had all the scores up and the highest scores with me and be scoring five five five and five and what we're talking about what doing in fires I'm I'm doing intense sorry I'm just you know what it is well that's the old scoring system when we did the old review bits of elimination I have a lemon flavors and something I've got the old we know how much stuck in my head still this is a war oh this is a roar we view as you can tell just then which means I don't really cut much out keeping it quiet there we say no sound effects right now okay a few sound effects yes so this is strawberry laser said from Barney's farm mainly a sativa yeah properly under sativa I don't know how this image is actually but Australia officer T bar lemon not lemon flavors are sativas so sticky green UK dropped me the science now I've heard the strength of this is coming high from probably about eighteen ranging from 18 to about twenty-eight percent THC which is a massive range a big big difference there ten percent imagine getting the eighteen percent and some smoke in the twenty eight percent one right next year [ __ ] a real man any more than junior yeah eighteen to twenty percent THC lovely lovely the juggling talked about the history of this talked about about you smoke this string of war so I'm all over the place right now guys so okay four things to cover let's start with the first category we're gonna go into the site solve it scoring out over ten as always so ten site ten smell ten taste ten effect would be a top score of 40 the highest I think we have is about thirty four thirty sites let's look at this no I've already looked this into the microscope I've seen it all the hill caves and crevices oh my gosh the first thing you're gonna notice we look at the site for SOT but it is bulky bulky as and it really is like on steroids this is so compact on the toilet they give and it's very sticky very moist and it's just so nice when you break it up I mean we break it up again you ever break it up again I'm so into this bit okay you hear that now it's very very moist yet you've got that snapback so you know when you split the weed it sort of just cuts through like perfection almost this one here doesn't it doesn't go like straight through it it comes up and it's little tiny boulders and you can see that on the outside but it has got a little old bits here and now I've got some I've got some bubble cheese there's the same sort of things little tile or boulders small brown pistons with all the trichomes it's all must be yellowy whites rounded us thank you see you sir guys yelling whites and I smoked some strawberry cough that was also very very light greeny whites in there and we just give a little tinge of yellow almost with orange and the greens and the whites are coming together really nice and there is this lovely shine in their suit dark greens as well it's very very pretty very looked after and yeah it's just these little holding on here I love them and little boulders why does a hat one let me know in the comment section if you know what the good little poker bits here so what am I gonna score this up for this site out of ten I'm really liking it and says four crystals and it is tight so for a sativa as well it's gonna be a high one guys it looks really really falling I'm gonna give any and a half that's a really good score so far great start strawberry lemonade is getting ignorant now about try remember where I am because it's been a while since I've done these we've used a bit rusty bit crusty let's get the cobwebs over and done with let's go on now to the smell so what is happening we've the smell on this one does it smell a strong breeze there's a smell of lemon you're getting a sweet a very faint sweet sweet citrusy smell so you're both you're both strawberries and you're both your Brophy shrubbery and your lemon is coming through on this smell but not so strong reek as other weeds do it it's very solemn just sort of just drifts in the background and your nostril isn't slight citrus yeah very slight citrus almost an earthly as well I suppose yeah a bit earthy citrus sweetness bit disappointed really great start with the sight the smell it's not gonna get it all there is nothing special at all I can't knock it it's nothing bad about it but I'm not even good from it and I could give it the average score of a seven average score of a seven anything that was maybe to my dislike go a bit lower but yeah it's nothing it smells nice smells nice that's it just smells nice nothing else nothing to shout about I'll give it a seven before the smell oh we're getting fun now this is the bit where after skinned up because we can do the taste and off about really do the effect so we're going to speed things up a little bit people sending me to meet some skin up so you skin apologize our way is one thing come on find all my grinders seems to have gone missing me only ones I can find that has the top and the bottom to it is this one here now even all my grinders oh maybe I could put them together I just got a freaking Stein growing up I don't know that all the top of the bottom that's the bottom isn't all the bottoms a year I should have had the tops for some reason I'm doing am I just doing I don't know throwing them away because I've got the weed in this one need the weeding this one is that's why I've got this one this one you don't need laughter you skinned out some embers go man does that mean they need to be macmaine that's it go for a few grinders but anyway what for overage skin up edge type edge too much each here we go guys now we do not recommend you to back piece of warning coming up alarm sounds use tobacco guys I'm getting down to a little bit I wish one day we can do reviews and I'm not using this tobacco or author says do not copy me we do not recommend you use tobacco in anything we don't really do anything that some guys just watch me strain Kanis we came the strings so you don't boo and I shouldn't have to smoke this brown government myth the whole tracks we trek copyrights gonna be whole gonna be inhaling my head with my my speech bubble there but now I'm gonna be uploading stuff to weed tubers well guys we cheap hello

slacking is he's transferring everything over to the we tube and this won't be in secondary really that he were to find a script where to find us but if you want to go and get into d out strain Cana land in the beach would be the one for you soon yeah I've been waiting to smoke some Seguin peeps because I didn't want to take any more that bottom would be a nice big part it's been a while since with the we view the last we'd view was think remember so I can't remember what the last we'd view with the last strain that we reviewed about quite a few strains I was some some of that smote upon purpose some are smoked by an accident I was gonna be doing a review of a shot at MIT oh gee I was smoking something strawberry lemon-aid and then realized wait a minute this doesn't taste like strawberry or lemonade just tastes minty chocolate he and OGE lot my desk as you can tell not the best grinder in the world grab this is recording you see that yeah you see that you step I was on purpose I did that on purpose of it I went to drop it in to show that if you do drop it should do that you'll need your balance you're right check the replay on that one can you do that please try that our home kids not kids adults please you've gotta be over 18 to watch this so kids you watching so much anymore but yet adults 18 and over do you feel you can do that please let me know I just have a ring on this fun issue perfect for doing that but now took as much of my phone was getting bigger all the ring was getting smaller I was getting tight and as bits careful we might lose the thumb sit that off I'm just right now on the grind I'm oh [ __ ] moving you get it Rocha they'd have you somewhere roach where'd you gone harder there this is crucial visitors they are okay but notice some of them don't stick as much as they should right so we view crew the fun bit we got strawberry lemonade we're gonna smoke it we're gonna tell you what it tastes like [Music] we live in this problem if it lets properly if it lights properly almost like strawberry tea strawberry green flavored those green a green tea strawberry flavored green tea lemon is lemon in now no sweet lemon there's an aftertaste of the strawberry I was smoking some of this with a sticky the other day and yet some billy kimball on him and what contrasting strains smoking at the vide converges full of gas oh geez gasps Nissa and then smoking some of this should really taste the difference love you contrasts and this is just pure flavor pure flavor what a strong point of this strain for the flavor choices out there are people that really do regard the flavor is the most important part I can't recommend this more really this is you know knowledge like you know don't mind lemon II don't mind straw because it does taste both and then when I say the lemon there's a definitely level with lemon in the intake will you take it bring it in you've got fizzy lemons lemonade I can see why it's called lemonade you've got tangy tangy fizziness on this it's not all about taste is about textures as well and you get that tasty texture of fizzy tangy lemon going in and then you breathe out it's almost like you're doing like a what he called she's just a little something is called you know then pipe things you know I'm talking about them anyway realize again if you're flavoring the flavor chaser this is one that you need to get off your tick mist because you've got you know okay lemon lemon lemon that's quite good put off a lemon like lemon bubble recently but apart from that and submit lemon haze was that review we did a couple years ago me and sticky don't get my lemons let me know in the comment section if you have got really nice lemon now all you've got recently or if just get lemon in your area you just pissed off of it really just enough this is not in that category now you coming from the lemon oh gee tiny bit on the og in their tiny bit the og in the nothing that's also good fix the effects the effects a little bit as well but we get a little bit a bit later right now it's still about the taste and yeah there's so much taste in there sweetness I've heard story caught before very sweet this is very sweet not so strawberry not really it's not there so vain store business on the outs the aftertaste that's on the outside on the outside there's a nap take their fear not on the out toka and the XL sweet that bitter as well it's great the great combinations in flavor up really gonna be a high one this and I gotta say really impressed to this I'm gonna give him no I don't wanna give it nine and a half I don't know is you tell me say they're not a waves don't I wanted to give it a night and give it a nine up lay up before we go on to the effects this is going to get no let's keep that in mind knowing on the taste it's still a very very good score loving this taste full of strawberry nurse full of lemonade us is now knowing on the taste we're getting T effects well so a lot of this I over the week so I can tell you the effects not going to just rely on me smoking this now the the effects on this game very high on the sativa side of things just a very focused on this if you do me I'm stuck in the babe you're focused I'm not gonna drain you of your motivation this one again love micro strains and again yeah this is definitely get your mind flowing and being in a way where if you're a creative person then you probably come up with some creative ideas kind of uh say she's great if a gay is great if I'm a creative person this makes me more creative and you creative don't let me know in the comment sections way too many questions I don't want to know that if you're creative yeah focused creative and yeah just up and go it's to sativas really strawberry call from the lemon little overs and sivir's I think that the Oh genus would make it a slight bit of indica in this don't get me wrong this you know you do fit on your body a little bit you can smoke this sort of late evening I recommend a few nights I'm sniffing i potent for my night time Smith but breakfast and afternoon what a great way to start your day and to go about your day as well smoking this one strawberry lemonade I think's again on the indica kind of guy there's a lot of this does buzz what it needs to do does what he needs to do so many strings are you smoking you know ah oh god oh god sit down for a bit now o'night gonna get caught I'll Drive my car drank its driver don't drive and smoke in Italy we wait for seven days then we drive and then we stop driving then we smoke again and then we stop driving for seven days okay so any officers are watching channel thank you for watching Cheers if you want to see my discussion on a livestream discussion about smoking wood THC in your blood the videos down there somewhere please find it and check it out but yeah going back to this effects I'm gonna say eight and a half year dude like the effects and again do I say about the medical science of it what would you smoke it for medical I don't really get on to them things that is a question I would like to know you why do you smoke marijuana is there medical reasons that you smoke it for me I need stuff that's maybe more on the spot my legs and arms moving Romek restless leg syndrome and all my other crazy things that I seem to suffer from so this or that calms me look that indica sort of calm me down he's getting a fire get me up nice and high little person I think it's score quite well what are you are you indica sativa do

for joining me this is strain Kaena see you later bye yo back again because I forgot something I told you was a bit rusty with the shows been a while I could beat you forgot to add the scores up and because I've actually gone away and remember that I forgot to tell you the scores I've got the calculator out and I can tell you the score is 33 33 is very high guys here's the table of the strain the strain table - exactly where that goes very very high 33 for the strawberry lemonade thanks for watching again I've completed on to say this but in Hammer subscribed now you can subscribe now you can like she's for watching the sea layer again lovely lovely big oh you're talking what would you write for market breaks it reads for each of them Wednesday", "auS2wH-qv6M": "[Music] was a good job welcome to another episode of taste my name is Alvin and today we've got a California legend man Tahoe oh gee let's get in for this profile I hope oh gee not to be confused with a child Tahoe oh gee could so it's a little different so Tahoe og is just a phenotype of the original og cush man much like King Louie the 13th was last week and Tahoe og cush is actually the child of Tahoe og and sfv og cush man so it's a little confusion of confusing but Tahoe og the strain is actually a phenotype of OG Kush but Tahoe og cush is the child of Tahoe og and SF v OG coach man a little confusing but that's where he goes I purchased this over at the Garden of Eden over in Hayward California and man there's only one more strain to go of that icon from when I was back at the bay but there is one more other strain that I did pick up from homey who shall remain nameless man a big shout-out to the flood anyway Garden of Eden over in Hayward man check them out big shout out to my man MC but this here is going to be a 90 attending indicate dominant strain stress insomnia pain depression and appetite are some of the medical ailments that it can help with some of the flavors and smells we should get is an earthiness a little bit of a citrus lemon and then a pine smell to it and so yeah everything sounds good man so let's uh let's get city senses alright so if it senses we always start off with the smell man right over here forgot to mention that it was a grown by Pharaoh farms they always do some good work but let's start off with the smell let's get hopping definitely pine and lemon right out the gate no mistaking that that's for sure this has been sitting for a little bit size a little bit of earthiness to it but definitely lots of pine and lemon no food I'll give it a little break yep even more stronger the pine smells a little bit more pronounced as well as the one yeah man all right so wha let's take a look all right so man take a closer look at it it is a beautiful beautiful dense nug man it is packed with a lot of trichomes and again like I mentioned it is a very intense and that just makes up for a nice fluffy blunt if you rolling it up of course we're gonna rape it and yeah man this is a strain that I would definitely love to press just because of the quantity of all the weed that you're gonna get from it and all the trichomes so the results gotta meet of it but uh with that said let's get pacing all right so that's what it looked like there's only one thing left to do man and that's taste it um but I did break it up and as before any time you break up the bub and you expose more of those tract homes to get a better terpene profile so that pine smelling that lemon smell is just way more prevalent was actually a smoked light of this when I was back home and man this came this became a top favorite I can see why it's popular strange but yeah man I'm gonna get to packing and we gonna get to taste strong time from the initial email like a pine Fung and then a lemon straight lemon on the exhale without one had a lot of lemon and it's very much slight taste not about you guys but I have dogs and I spray pine saw when I clean up any accidents then you can kind of get the fumes you know from the song I mean from the solution and just like that very lemon and pine flavor it's crazy see when I was back home and we were chiefing this yeah it was was all smoke so I didn't get this flavor profile but very strong distinct lemon and pine with just that like a little layering of funky skunk ease to it man this is good I can see why people love this drink it's definitely moving up to one of my tops quickly I may let's get a high-mass time for of eat highs if you are new to these videos men and then have a 5-10 rule when I get high and I smoke for five minutes or wait for five minutes come back to you guys I'll let you know how I feel in my brain let you feel my body any other flavor profiles I may be having go back to the vape smoke or vapor for another five minutes come back at the 10 minute mark and do the same thing all over reason being is that hybrids do change so it's very interesting to see how you can either go from a sativa to a hybrid or a high-intensity Macabre not so Thibodaux an indica or an indica bag to a hybrid man talking about favorite thing so with that said in 5rh also at the five-minute mark man the Tahoe og hits that's for sure yeah man it's strong was an indica straight out the gate you can you can tell there's a little bit of a sativa to it just just because you're not completely stoned to the bone but at the end of the day I gotta say this is a good strain just because of how quick the onset of that it's a stony feeling was you didn't have to wait just a few hits five minutes is all it took man so we're gonna keep at it we're gonna see how if it takes me deeper down that indica route or off we kind of just Betty Coast so y'all are another five yeah ten minute mark it did take me down further that in the corral but you know I do like something about this strain it takes you right to the edge of Stoneman I mean you can feel it in your body I feel it in my eyelids but it gives you just a hint of three more functionality I mean I spent a little bit of sativa otherwise I wouldn't be able to continue with this video man I know that one day we're gonna I'm gonna be tasting a heavy heavy indica and I just be way more punch than I've ever been but this is a very hard-hitting deep indica takes you right to the edge of complete lock lockness couch lock stone enos stone to the bone whatever you want to call it takes you right to the edge but it leaves you with enough sativa characteristics to kind of function so yeah I really appreciated about this strength so I like it so with that said may let's move over to the overview Tahoe og the legendary strain man again not to be confused with its offspring Tahoe og cush that it had bred with SF vog believe Cali connection did that they put those two together the Tahoe G sf vog and then G cush again this one is just the Tahoe Oh G so it is a phenotype of an original og cush great I purchased this over at the Garden of Eden over in Hayward California and this was bred by Pharaoh farms it is a 9210 indica dominant strain stress insomnia pain depression and appetite are some of the things that it can help with let's see here earth lemon and pine flavors and smells are what you can get to it again my particular batch was just a little bit older I just been sitting on a little longer than I'd like to but nonetheless it was still potent and the flavors are still there man so that's a testament to those blowers and the string let's see here at the five-minute mark it did hit me quickly the indica did set in very quick not true heavy again that's that ninety ten did leave you with a little bit of sativa functionality but at the 10 minute mark man that in because I'm it doesn't really really set in like I mentioned it just takes you all the way to the edge but kind of keeps you from jumping completely so if I had to score it on a one to five man I'm gonna give this one a five I like it I like those indicas I like sativas I like the ones where you can get a good kind of feel for that particular string so for example this is a Tahoe oh gee this has characteristics of being a deep indica and as soon as you hit it hit you quick it tells you that I am a deep end because this is what I have about and then it plays with you take you all the way to the edge and then it keeps you from going there man on so it leaves you with a little bit of functionality I definitely would not recommend doing this when you have something active to do this is something for you know you want to watch a movie or you want to you know read a book something to where you want to relax but you just want to have a little a little bit of brain capacity to do something but this is also I can tell a great great strain so yeah on a scale of one to five Tahoe og definitely gets a five man let's wrap it up all right man first and foremost big thank yous and big shoutouts to all my folks that helped me out with this man rocks are

another video it's been a while guys I'm really excited to bring this to you guys it is another strain review for review today we actually have some violator Kush this is brought to you by coastal wildfire I'll show you guys they can here coastal wildfire that's the can right there just has a little bit of warnings and whatnot and that's their Instagram if you guys want to check them out so this is what we have here it is the violator Kush it was also grown by if you guys can see it right there there've a de Craft cannabis you can also check out their Instagram as well let's jump right into the review guys I am really really excited to bring this one to you guys it's been a while since I've done one so let's get right to it so before we show you the nugs and the Snell and everything like that I'm gonna give you a little bit of background information about the violator khush violator cush just by the name of it it has cushion it so you know it's gonna be a pure indica strain it was bred by Barney's farm out in Amsterdam famous breeders been breeding a lot of strains for a long time so check him out as well Barney's farm and the lineage of the violator Kush is mulana which is a strain I've never heard of never tried and I'm I don't know if I ever will sounds like an old-school type strain but so it's a cross of mallanna and Hindu Kush and Hindu Kush is a very staple popular strain floats around Canada all the time it's one of those like short short dents big nugs if flowers relatively quickly so it's a really good plant to grow for beginners but yeah that's the cross mallanna times Hindu Kush and you get violator Kush so I am going to pause the video turn the camera around we're going to show you the nugs that we have to deal with here and we're gonna get right into this strain review guys so stay tuned right guys so we're back here I'm just showing you a small nug of the violator Kush this is what we have here I'm not really able to zoom in or anything so this is kind of the best shot you're really gonna get as you guys can see really really frosty buds really dense nug structure trim job is on point no really leafy fan leaves anywhere there's a few little ones but it has a lot of trichome coverage on it so I'm not really complaining but this is the violator Kush some beautiful beautiful looking cannabis I have to say props to the grower ther Vita you are killing it man but yeah let's get right into this review guys I'm gonna turn the camera back around and we'll start getting the smell the taste and the effects alright so now that you guys seen what the bud looks like we're obviously to get into the smell of it now the smell coming off this violator cush is something really nice it's not anything crazy exotic like I don't know fruits or anything like mint or chocolate or anything like that it's nothing too exotic it's got that typical cush attributes I'll go in for a smell and I'll tell you exactly what I'm talking about so I have a half ounce jar right here guys so there's definitely gonna be a pungent smell coming from this jar so give me one second whoo such a nice smell man okay so what I'm getting from this violator could is that typical cushy kind of attributes it has that just really loud kind of punch you in the nose type of turps as soon as you open the jar it's just like oh yeah so it gives you that slight pine enos in the initial inhale it has a little bit of pine a little bit of earthiness but it has this overwhelming sweetness almost lavender II kind of scent to it it's really weird I have to go in for another smell to kind of pinpoint it another way I could honestly describe the smell is I don't know if you've ever smelled like rotting fruit like a rotting peach or like fermented fruits or something I really can't perfectly describe it for you guys but that's the best way I can kind of describe the smell that I'm getting it has like this sweet kind of rotten fruity kind of smell but it's really sweet and there's like a slight kind of spiciness to it as well so it gives you kind of almost that lavender kind of smell in your nostrils it's a really complex to her bean profile it's not something I've ever really smelled before with that rotting kind of three lavender kind of smell it's really really nice I just keep wanting to smell the jar that's so nice it is but like I said really loud turps as soon as you open the jar just punches you in the face but I gave you guys the looks of the cannabis I gave you the smell I'm gonna get a nice joint rolled up we're gonna go outside and we're gonna get on with this strain review so stay tuned guys what's up guys we're back here in the backyard have a nice joint rolled up over here hopefully you guys can see that nice little kind of cone we're gonna get this violator lit up and we're gonna tell you how it tastes and how the effects are so give me one second gonna grab later alright let's spark this baby up hopefully you guys are smoking along with me hopefully you guys are also enjoying the strain review so far let me know in the comments down below what do you guys smoking on what are you guys dabbing on where are you guys from I'm always curious to see and to know what you guys are doing and where you're from then shout out to all the new subscribers we actually hit 6500 subscribers so thank you guys so so much I just want to say that in the video right now but yeah let's get this joint sparked up so as you can see I'm just kind of lighting the tip first this is the best way to ensure your joint won't start canoeing or running so just like the tip first once it's kind of lit ooh alright so the violator beautiful Wow really really really smooth smoke but because it's a violator it's a cush as soon as it hits your lungs it just expands them and you could just feel the heaviness in the hit it's really nice I don't know if you guys can see that but the ashes burning nice and salt and pepper it's not like a full white ash but it is salt and pepper it was flushed very well this cannabis was grown in organic living soil so that's always a plus some very very tasty cannabis I'm gonna give you the taste right now I'm gonna go in on another hit give me one sec so the taste I'm getting off this is very similar to the smell it has that piney earthy cushy taste but right on the back end that just lingers all like all in your mouth and just all over your tongue is that sweet kind of it's it's a sweetness it doesn't come through like the smell the smell has that like rotten fermented kind of fruit lab in there type of smell but in the taste it comes through as more of just a sweetness so you get that piney earthy cushiness and then the sweetness just kind of coats your mouth and your tongue on the exhale it's really nice such amazing amazing cannabis that we have right here I'm so grateful and so blessed to be smoking this right now I can't think coastal wildfire and Theravada enough for this amazing batch of violator so tasty so potent that's another thing so I gave you guys basically the looks smell taste for the effects this violator Kush like it hits you instantly it's literally like within the first two or three poles that you take off the joint you already feel so heavy and just so like it's it's like it punches you in the side of the head to hide like that's how potent it is it is so nice Wow some very potent stuff like I said as soon as you you take a couple bits off the joint you kind of just feel like this melt enos in your head your eyes your body and it's like you just got punched in the side of the head it was like holy super sedate 'iv super relaxing plenty of pain relieving properties this is one of those strains that you smoke you go back inside you sit on the couch and you just watch movies or you just do nothing for whatever time period you feel like because this [ __ ] just knocks you on your ass it is amazing I really wanted to bring you guys this review because I've just been smoking it like I've picked up a half ounce and i've just been smoking and smoking and smoking it because it is so good so tasty so smooth just the potency is there the buds look beautiful smell amazing like there's just nothing I could really ask for I don't want to drag this review too long because I feel like it's already probably like 15 minutes by now but I want to get into the ratings out of five for violator Kush so we're gonna go for the looks damn beautiful beautiful kind of light greenish buds with dark kind of reddish orange hairs all over beautiful beautiful white white trichomes that just cover the entire bud they weren't the biggest nugs but they were probably medium-sized nugs super dense super sticky super resinous like it was just breaking it up your hands would just stick together the smell coming off it was so pungent like the looks out of five I'm gonna give it you know it didn't have the most crazy bag appeal like colors wise like purple and you know like all different stuff like that so for bag appeal and looks I'm gonna give it a four out of five but this was some amazing cannabis like I'm not trying to devalue it or like make it look bad or anything but it was some amazing stuff so so that's for the looks four out of five for the smell I really like the smell I really like the smell honestly super loud as soon as you pop open that jar it just fills up the room with that smell it has that piney earthy sweet like fermenting rotting fruits and a hint of like a spicy lavender kind of it's a really nice smelling strain so for the smell I'm gonna give it a four out of five so that's the look smell the taste the taste comes through similar to the smell it has that piney earthiness that sweetness and a little bit of I guess spiciness um it's not my favorite tasting strain so I'm gonna give that a three and a half out of five still something that's really good really enjoyable to smoke now for the effects man I don't think you can get anything better than this like it's super potent it affects you immediately the effects are long-lasting the smoke is smooth like you could take a huge poll like I'm gonna do right now super-smooth but at the same time it expands your lungs and it just rips them apart like it's really nice and it just hits you so heavy for the effects if you're looking for a kick ass in the constrain that's just gonna give you no depression no anxiety pain relieving properties couch lock crazy munchies and you just don't want to do anything for that day violator cush wow this is some potent stuff so for the effects I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 5 I love these effects these are amazing amazing so I don't know what more else to say I'm gonna give my overall rating for violator cush out of 5 violator cush is gonna get a solid 4 out of 5 this strain is fantastic if you're an indica person you definitely want to try violator cush I just can't see anything negative really about it like it was just that enjoyable I don't know if it was because of the grower and the job that he did but this came out like amazing fire like I'm so baked I'm still have a few hits left of this joint but I hope you guys enjoyed the video that's been the official review of violator Kush by I'm always blazing and yeah I hope you guys have a big day and we'll see you in the next video peace guys [Laughter] [Music]", "LjENDvPseVQ": "welcome to 420 Ohio's medical marijuana strain reviews orange 43 by song cultivated by calyx peak is a cross of white fire OG and orange and a tier 2 higher THC strain generally this strain is listed as an indica leaning hybrid but my dispensary listed orange 43 as a sativa for what it's worth the buds are more sativa like in appearance and also seem to function like a sativa when waved orange 43 is presented in a clear bottle test results are easy to read on the back of the bottle and the twist off cap shouldn't be too much of a struggle for patients with pain in their hands or fingers my 2.83 gram dosage largely consisted of two large buds with a few smaller ducts the buds grind a bit sticky so be sure to break up the nugs a little before grinding appearance is a bit frosty as cannabis trichomes bathe every inch of the bud colas it's almost as if the two buds were made up of smaller pieces constructed and painstakingly glued back together by the sticky trichomes in terms of aroma orange 43 he lives up to its reputation this strain will hit you as soon as you open the bottle and that initial burst of aromas will lean heavily on citrus specifically oranges or orange peel from a flavor perspective this drain tastes like a rustic barrel aged orange juice cocktail the terpenes mix in some rather unique ways providing a gentle relaxing vape with a lovely current of sweetness the first rush of flavors lean a bit earthy with pine notes and just a hint of ginger and mint this is followed by a refreshing zing of citrus zest and a smooth aftertaste like orange sherbert or creamsicle the bouquet was absolutely delightful start-to-finish medicinally this strain didn't provide any substantial pain relief I did however note a significant increase in energy and creativity as well as a soothing headband effect that eased anxiety and tension euphoria with this strain is pretty significant due to the higher THC percentage in combination with the two dominating terpenes limonene and Turpin allene if you are sensitive to higher concentrations of THC you may want to take it slow with this strain for those who find that euphoria helps with their headspace or mental health this strain should deliver in spades for you because orange 43 does a great job delivering euphoria this strain isn't exactly the best for rest or sleep rather orange 43 would be best used in the mornings or midday and complemented by an indica like ghost OG at night overall orange 43 is one fascinating strain featuring a dazzling orange zest aroma a refreshingly minty sweet taste and a wonderful sense of euphoria energy and mental relief check this one out if you see it at your dispensary final rating 4.8 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or share this video on reddit and don't forget to visit WWF or 2008 i/o for the full review of orange 43 as well as other ohio medical marijuana strains and products thanks", "LyrhiQt7jZ8": "here's a question for you would you smoke GMO pot activists around the country they're rallying against genetically modified foods meanwhile states around the nation are preparing to legalize marijuana the day may soon come when large corporations will be developing genetically modified forms of cannabis for sale on the legal market the end result of GMO cannabis comes into being could be similar to the current food market sales of genetically engineered products could make up a large percentage of sales while organically grown marijuana could develop a devoted following among smokers by some measures cannabis is now the nation's largest cash crop the market for legal marijuana is larger than that for corn wheat or sugar the amount of money to be made by ending prohibition against the plant is enormous this is driving large corporations to begin looking at modifying the DNA of cannabis to increase profits producing genetically modified products can increase yield or add resistance to pests for some crops cannabis is largely resistant to pests and does not need pesticides or herbicides to grow but if large corporations distribute GMO marijuana it will provide them the ability to patent and control the production of cannabis in the event of widespread distribution of GMO cannabis a different legal problem will present itself will farmers be allowed to grow marijuana that is not genetically modified federal law requires some farmers to purchase Roundup Ready seeds from Monsanto every year one farmer recently received eight years in prison for saving seed from one year's crop to plant the following spring which lost a sale for the food manufacturer Monsanto is already investing in research and development of GMO marijuana and farmers may be able to grow marijuana in the next few years but soon after that they may be branded criminals for not growing GMO strains some observers believe large pharmaceutical companies are already growing vast fields of GMO marijuana preparing for the end of cannabis prohibition in the very near future one has to wonder if the current debate on health effects of cannabis will soon change to debate pitting GMO against organic varieties of cannabis", "zHPMItrvIck": "or let's get into the news yeah yeah check Business Insider what's up I was just gonna say this is [ __ ] mind-blowing to me man this is absolutely mind this is titled a startup with ties to Bayer Montanez linked a to 122 million deal to make lab-grown marijuana and it's eyeing the pharma industry that's a lot to take in there yeah it was a lab-grown marijuana a to me what does this mean Oh synthetic cannabis no it's not synthetic this is done with the natural processes they're talking about genetically modifying bacteria for cuz they use them in the perfume industry right now right they'll genetically modify a bacteria so that is genome is targeted to produce certain fragrances sure which are terpenes flavonoids stuff like that and has the potential to be able to genetically modify a bacteria with THC synthase so that it can be able to make its own THC and then you could even have it to where it's making THC and corresponding cannabinoids with it right and I mean this is like bleeding-edge science in the fragrance industry in the fragrance industry if you know much about the like concentrates industry everything they do is all the science behind it is hundred-year-old science ripped from the fragrance industry in the perfume industry isolating and selling terpenes and flavonoids and cannabinoids are just kind of another secondary metabolite that they definitely you have the potential to be able to lab grow bacteria that make THC man that bypasses the farm you know they're talking about what a pain in the ass it is to get consistent product and to open up these huge farming facilities huge growing facilities we talked yesterday show about 123 page environmental impact study that you had to pay for just to be considered you know what don't be allowed to grow so I mean to just be able to grow it in a laboratory it's [ __ ] mind-boggling to me man there's also talking about the getting lesser-known components such as THC B which staunch 'as appetite but is only present in the plant in low levels with starches what a staunch is made on suppresses you know I would say I would think so man I can't imagine Staunton is good so is that you just a little buzz homie let's say they come up you know Pharma comes up with a pill and I know you're gonna the answer to this is probably not cool but then it what it does is it helps people it helps suppress their appetite if they have a weight problem I'm sure but it's sort with no side effects and what if they come up with a bunch or whatever they start coming up with things in Big Pharma that don't have all these oh may cause this may be this may cause that you know isn't that a good thing if ya the Landers mate yeah I think the what if is out of it man they're gonna be using this absolutely if they're investing this kind of money into the technology and then a biotech of it just in terms of cleanliness of the final product this is a lab grade clean for everything and I mean this this just demonstrates the with with enough genetic diversity what microbes are capable of doing yeah when I say genetic diversity I mean I get that they're implanting other genetics into here into their right just because it's from a different species or something doesn't mean that that's not adding diversity into that organism so a there's genetically modifying and then there's Aneta cailli modifying yeah we people like their stone wash jeans if they knew that that's actually microbes that do that yeah man it's actually track it durable that's cool so I guess the takeaway is eventually we do will not need to grow any cannabis the bacteria will do it for us yes man I just like the pill mom so when are we getting a hold of this bacteria for the new recharge proto snort the recharge after all", "3Wj5RLCBx5c": "I came a little Cushman my name is Damien people call me D was five years ago I

vanilla and and outside smells like an earthy tone of you know earthy vanilla and then when you break it in [Music] ah it has this sweet ah it's like a sweet sour i don't know it smells really good and it looks really good too let me let me show you guys that's the inside on the outside let me try to put it together so i can show you like a complete nog look at that beauty green orange purple pull over look at that that is a nice look that is a nice looking nug oh i really like that smell it is quite dense too that's it that's that's quite intense look as you can see is this this the whole thing looks pretty intense i wonder how much i mean i broke it in half so how much would this is 2.1 grams oh crap oh crap yeah i can't i can really it keeps it moving but if you put it down it's 2.1 grams for this nug it's a quite dense knot that is not bad at all look at the green on this one over here oh that's nice that's nice this grinds up soon let's bring some let's put this puppy back in there so as always a clean bowl plain freshly after the solution and i didn't have any i couldn't stop at the store today to grab any crystal i mean any glass screens and then i'm gonna use a dirty screen so i just no screen for this test i'm pretty sure i'm gonna be sucking some of the canvas in there but it doesn't matter a lot of people like to use this strain to treat anxiety chronic pain depression fatigue stress it's a really good strain not bad okay okay it has this citrusy flavor i don't taste the vanilla though i wish i did i got excited i love vanilla i thought i was i mean and i'm disappointed in the sense that i i didn't taste vanilla but i'm not disappointed at the flavor itself it's not bad it has this citrusy taste to it it's not bad at all like like sweet citrusy sweet they're heating they're hitting into it i'm already feeling it um and it's one it's like that again like when you know you're not sober but you're not high and that's what i'm at right there like i know i'm not sober but i'm not high i'm just feeling different i am liking i'm starting to feel like like i want to do something and like i don't know i'm starting to like this i can't wait to actually hit very good okay that last hit it was super harsh like i coughed so hard like if i was my first time smoking i don't know what's up with that but it was really harsh there's still some green in there so i haven't even smoked the whole bowl it's not cashed but that was a nasty head wow let's try it again well was incredibly smooth compared to the last hit [Music] the flavor is completely gone they only lasted about three hits into it the forehead was super hard to make me cough my ass off the fifth head is surprisingly smooth and still burning it's still burning but with no flavor and now i do feel i feel really good i feel relaxed but not couch relaxed but i just wanted to sit there you know my body's feeling good he's feeling relaxed i feel like energized like i want to do something i want to i want to get on something maybe sign something or even go for a walk my fat ass wants to go for a walk okay okay okay this this is some [ __ ] then he's cause i feel like i want to do something i mean i don't feel i don't feel like sleeping relax i feel like okay i feel good i feel relaxed i feel loose i feel like i want to go for what i can't believe i'm saying wow it has a great aroma to it love the vanilla smell to it unfortunately you can't taste it you will taste the citrusy and it has a little bit of turtle beans to it because you can smell like the citrusy to it you know what i mean like sweet citrus it's pretty good when you break it that's how it smells like that and the outside just smells like earthy vanilla it smells really good all the way it tastes good up to three hits and then i don't know if it was just maybe it went down the wrong pipe but that forehead it was wow but then hit after that it was just smooth you know let's go for another one yeah i think i think that that that one hit it was really bad maybe it was just i don't know i don't know what it was but i got like somebody just tried cannabis for the first time they didn't do it this all times i don't know it sounds really freaking good though so yeah tastes good you know what i want to taste it up the babe though because he has maybe we can taste the vanilla of the vape that's what we're gonna do yes and he has battery all right let me turn it up and pack it and we're gonna taste it off of this let me clean it let me clean it this is awesome they're probably gonna taste the vanilla [Music] we're gonna put it at 410 which is gonna wait uh he vibrated he's at 410. ah do you want me to true am i gonna taste vanilla nothing came out but i tasted the hell out of those terpenes no vanilla no vanilla i don't want to play with that's all right we got super citrusy [Music] but i'm more sour it's like citrusy but i mean you taste the terpenes it is good but it sounds more sour than sweet it has this aftertaste though it lingers that sourness it lingers it tastes really good i mean i i just wanted it to taste the vanilla but it didn't happen uh if i had to choose between these two i think i'll go with the vape on this one as well i mean looking rotates really good off the ball you can taste it it tastes good but the flavors are a lot more pronounced in the face so this is another three that will be vaping more than bernie i just don't like that i didn't get it man i'm freaking high okay okay i think it just hit me full force i'm feeling really good i'm really high right now and i still want to go outside i still want to do something still feeling energized i feel like like man it's covered right now right but like a barbecue man i think this is like the type of straining you you want to smoke at a barbecue bro me personally i'll be with a blood on my mouth or joint i mean i'll be able to join on my mouth and behind the grill i like grilling so that would be me passing the joints and flipping burgers having a little get together not party a barbecue with some music yeah i think this is one of those social streams you just want to socialize energize want to do something i like it i like it a lot i like it but it doesn't like that vanilla well i mean [ __ ] it is really good though i just wish he gave me so freaking thirsty man he got me like really thirsty i don't think that's a side [Music] but anyways i mean overall it's a really good string okay i like if i have to give it some leaves i would do eight eight these out of ten because i like sativa it hits fast it makes me feel energetic you made my fat ass want to take a walk so that that that's gonna be worth something really good flavor citrusy i love it it smells great it has the different types of smell it has the the earthy vanilla smell on the outside you break it it smells citrusy almost sour and when you smoke it you really taste the terpenes and if you vape it it's just all the flavor intensifies so overall it's a good strain so i give it eggplants yeah i like it i actually like it i gotta smoke some more of that and i started working on something i don't know what but i'm gonna do something i actually like that string well guys this is all i got for this review thank you so much for tuning in for this one if you liked the video don't forget to hit them with a thumbs up and if you liked all the videos or like the content so far hit that sub button and ring the bell so that way you know when i put some other videos online i'll see you guys in the next one thank you so much for watching [Music] peace [Music] you", "16FNFdDeQeE": "we'll break down light discos but I'm a district just that told us I just got off a bus when I read in a we does attest that Johnny said Icelanders flow and I've got better also I do that corny but if he takes over the deadline your people [Music] Wi-Fi is G fortunately I have now an outboard I prefer older that's to do it's probably nice because you but you have run out the board pursue the rap sort of you know tracking on too much Wi-Fi energy will kick straight into the clips of the board or the first got here I'll get this little mayor I do all seem to say sorry about the fact that it's raining absolutely you'd be up to here that the background see not live about there but I didn't want to just not review this and having this left of what we need to get it done now yeah is what it is let's click straight into me first got the clips to the board so you can see some you know now it's only G notice that we've got and then yeah we'll come back or give it its proper you let you know exactly what I'm thinking about it give it a rate your people what it's good actually CV I've got something really nice for it's double booked at this is Wi-Fi 3G or as its otherwise known white fire oh gee this is essentially a cross between fire Oh G which have smoked himself and the Y easily sort of read up on across and I know leafy is not the best source of information but what leafy sort of said on it it was it takes most of its traits from the fire Oh G and then the wider it was crossed into was just sort of to give it more yield in when people were growing and we have got just under a huge list here house makes a little bit of it as you can see some super fire I mean this is UK grown I thought I'd definitely show it because it's been a while since I've had some proper AG on the channel how do look my energies as well so I can say Wi-Fi Eugene where this otherwise known of white fire og certainly looking absolutely fire I don't know who actually grew this at the Grove I saw some locally grown AG both is doing absolutely smashing job real nice consistency between the notes it looks a lot like a proper OG and I was going to say that as well fire oh gee like I have said smoke fire AG before he is very very similar to this I mean this looks like a proper die so G night structure it's covered in trichomes proper nice and light green are mostly AG's are getting to be God that every G sort of structure to it as well it's sort of small nukkie sort of boards but absolutely covered fire edgy as well one of the reasons it was called fire edgy supposedly is because of the sort of red sort of pistols that you do see that on this as well with you I've got these dark sort of red pistols just get a really nice look across the Bloods I have to see the climatic trichomes and give you an idea of the smell it's it's quite hard to explain if you smoke fire OG you'll know what sort of smell Amana by EU standard OG in the sense if you do get that OG gas coming through but it's not like a bitty Kimber or anything like that it's more sort of like a muted OG out again but I think muted I don't mean like it's just not very flavor that I just mean it's not like as over-the-top loud as summation of it oh jeez will be that when you spend a boutique embrace like that knock knock back sort of effect when you smell it like it's not for me that's loud when you smell this it's a little bit more so but it's definitely still got that fresh or og kick there it's also got a bit of solvent if you sort of tone to it as well but you do get on some you know jeez and like I said I have smoked this I will wait for the property review to get more in depth on it and stuff like that but yeah some really nice flavour there as well definitely picking up those earthy tones like that oh gee Cass keep you cannot say no just pop that once window as much as they can I just drop the nog so you can see someone has actually to kill with this well I say a smoke fire eg before and a super-nice something of it last year it was banging I did really really like I love my energies will necessarily have set fire to you have a favor because sometimes I do that more some that pack bit more flavor a bit more of that gas bit more than that punch but I definitely enjoyed it it had a nice of you see what Cassie flavor to it the fire Reggie I'm on about and this is very similar but both for them fire OG and this I will say and I must have any smokes a little bit of this I will give you more in depth when we get to it if they've got really good effects I mean I really had once before this but it's certainly certainly quite a strong one as a lot of your OGS are which is why a lot of people like him but yeah this is definitely sitting more gonna sort of middle of the spectrum at OG that more sort of earthy gassy sort of thing but if you've had a proper good OG on the tunnel since you have that like SF vog so glad we've got another one on I'm in naturalize this is probably sleeping and again I'm not going to stick a flash off but that's a bit the zoom for us there we go Wi-Fi OG ake a Wi-Fi AG if you love yet oh geez this is gonna be a good one I can say I wish I wish I knew who actually agree this is that batch like a shout out because you smashed it really nice oh gee sort of structures to the boards real NASA consistent nice and dense bright green colors and just covered in Tri codes absolutely covered now even these little little hooks and stuff is still that same og sort of structure that bold reef sort of a knuckle sort of nog structured you know I mean sort of a bit more sort of round and flat I like this the big ones yeah definitely looking about some fire AG by that I mean obviously it is fire AG well Wi-Fi AG foot you know obviously fire is using the gospel what I meant by that is looking out sort of paying AG is what I meant to say but yeah I said fire but it's probably confusing me yes looking out something absolutely bag you know G that's why this a damn let's get this put away and then get back just make you the [ __ ] and enjoy that damn see prepared so just got that suit lid as you just seen definitely some nice looking for this you know it's been a while since you had some proper OG on the channel so this is Michael you know lack border told you pretty ten times by this point this is Wi-Fi OG also known as white fire oh gee it's a cross of Phi Rho G and the white so I've never actually smooth the straight of the wires just make a couple of strains out of it crossed into and but I have smoked straight or fire edgy is what I enjoy although making on my favorite energy but I am definitely a fan of oh geez they just seen yourself in the clips that they've bought definitely some nice little keynotes definitely got those og look to where they're really ball grown you know nice and dentists and stuff like that hot shower growers that don't need to expect through it everywhere nice dense Bowl four knobs really nice to be included to death and really good traction coverage you know that sort of TRICARE coverage expect from oh geez not like over the top Kate but definitely a lot of try kids on it and and yeah definitely some nice-looking energy food and I've got to say for geez there's always a ranges like flavors and a range I'd say although cheese as well and you may sort of one's really aged you're sort of I also think of it as like a spectrum I think it was the CCC 422 I've seen originally save this sort of thing and if you think of it as like a spectrum of like on the left hand side you've got your Billy Kim but the OG Kush stuff like that on your right hand side you've got your stuff like Skywalker og and some that you need a bit more sort of almost creamy sort of marshmallowy sort of flavours you know marshmallow he obviously sits on this side but like the Skywalk case there's something you sort of maybe 300 G's as well and then in the middle or I'd say you've got you sort of earthy oh geez some cushy oh geez as well so that'll be stopped lightly fire oh gee like you can really glue stuff like that that sits in the middle and obviously like say it's arranged dose of spectrum so there's things that sit in between like a blueberry OG you probably sit between those two sides so that's sort of what I mean when I see you say the sort of og spectrum I'm talking about and this definitely lands down a little bit so there's definitely OGS with more flavour in favor of this SH pine Earth fee sort of almost more ski sort of flavor and we definitely do something get some of that og sort of gas place nowhere near as pronounced as you've maybe see on Google sort of oh jeez it is more that earthy flavor that comes through which I still enjoy you know I'd still say I enjoy it as a flavor I can it's almost a silly cool a bit of flavor because yeah that earthy sort of musky flow it's musky flavor isn't really as flavorful as other flavors if you know what I mean and what I definitely enjoy it's definitely one that could smoke a lot love but you know it's not it's not over the top Hey does it have loads of flavour is what I'm trying to say it has these like if he knows he's pushing an age-based not loads of flavor there I could say does have that sort of OG gas that you pick up on it be definitely picking a lot more energy gas or something like a Billy Kimber or something like that and probably even you know like it could really glue you've probably get a bit more of a kick tomato something like that as well this has like a save just at soon port there if you flavor so it's nothing crazy to write home about in that department I say it's probably it's best factor they serve Wi-Fi oh gee is it strength a lot of oh jeez do you have really good highs really good strength behind them I say this one has a really really nice high so I felt like all over the body sort of setting quite well sort of high and I definitely feel it once I smoked it definitely has strong effects to it but definitely quite clean hi it wasn't you know sort of like foggy or like meeting if you're lazy or anything like that it was just it definitely could be want to go to sleep on like that don't get me wrong this could you know put you to sleep or I'd say it just more sort of completely cleared of mind got you really nice and like just properly stoned but not like like I say foggy or cloudy or anything like that just more like a clean but heavy stones I really think the higher on this it is something to behold at max a I think that a lot of those G's do have good highs but I think this wife Angie definitely has a really good eye I have to be forced anything when I smoke fire eg before like say I did to make fire injury last year and they are very similar I think the main difference in sort of Wi-Fi OG of the fire edgy is that the white that's crossed into it usually helps with like yields and I stuff like that and I was in production in the planets so I think that the flavors between this and the fire og are very very similar like I say it's that middle of the lime sort of og that's not over the top three before we start off if you sort of notice that you're picking up really and it's burning okay I'm not gonna say it's the best sort of burning but I've ever had because you know it boots nice they've been slowly but I've been that ash definitely be cleaner definitely and for that reason I don't think I can give it to high rates in I think a different battery this wildfire you could definitely pick up a higher rate and then what I'm going to give it and if it was just sort of cleaner and you know I had to clean a hash and sort of a cleaner cleaner sort of smoother smoke to it as well either we've that sort of simple earthy flavor that's always gonna have and I think this exact batch as good as it looks and stuff like that and as good as the effects are it for me it's sort of a low eights I probably give this like a pain point free like I say I enjoyed it I really enjoyed the high to it and like say it's not burning [ __ ] like it burns okay it's just the ash could be cleaner and I definitely be able to give a different sample of this is - was cleaner maybe a bit of a higher score but this Wi-Fi OG for me is never gonna pull to higher score just because I know this for me better oh geez are there with or flavor probably enjoy more and just as good highs that's not to knock this down and say you know it [ __ ] I did you may like I didn't enjoy it because I did so it's a simple flavor that movie must be sort of flavor bit of edgy gas in there it's didn't enjoyable smoke and the high is definitely it's wicked factor yeah I really enjoyed the high off they're different stunts products they've got portable high marks and his Wi-Fi or G but I don't think he's ever going to be a cannot attempt to me I just think there are a Jesus it he preferred to it but yeah we need us review there I didn't want to sort of dragged on too long you know I'm I'm glad he wouldn't forgive me other Damon but yes that's the Wi-Fi og okay what fire edgy obviously it's been a while so if I the og on the channel so good together you know prop one back on hopefully we'll get some better samples of AG's to have looked as well because I'm sure there's some huge ease out there like a proper nice batch of a certain energy that definitely put it a 10 out of 10 on their ears because I do not my orgies all say that definitely and I enjoyed this it's just there's oh geez oh definitely yeah that's ain't Wi-Fi energy we're back even more content real soon", "JWtlQMvOE9k": "other people and welcome back for another edition of

awarding us to it but don't think like your dog you're not getting that like holiness to it this is a real this is a different old school tie maybe some bit yeah Afghan language yeah yeah Annie Malayan language if you if you wouldn't mean now the plants that come from Afghanistan and things are obviously grown our altitude open MLAs and things like that and produce lots and lots of resin lots of glands to protect myself on sullen things are so this is why you get this peppermint earthing a [ __ ] when you get you when you get you all your old teachers from Afghanistan and Pakistan things are they've all gone in India they've all gone in immolating things and they all produce a hell of a lot of oils and you can really smell these earthy oily tappings in your bum I'm certainly done I'm not I'm not gonna get so I'm not getting sausage cattle off on that one that's not me I'm not getting any meat dogs out with that one but I've been on this [ __ ] good as I just said it I can understand where that we're oh yeah who's that he's just happy yeah yeah yeah yes I told it'll open it up a way and CLT balls chabela me the smell of it opens very particularly very spicy very watery very earthy very old-school not a dainty I'm not gonna say dank leo I'm not getting nor dinosaurs - now I've done that he's getting a slight citrus time after [ __ ] that I'm gonna have to for that yeah when you open that all is totally changes you're getting a lot more citrusy north to improve they're really really nice it's old-school we're now a little bit yes cc-cat the lemon attack thing again he'll district talking about somebody about a string and it's an automation screen anytime you know the lemongrass taste to it and I'm gonna say very very very very slow in improvers lemongrass that we into what we're gonna see oh I'm gonna topple topple topple we listen here we go here we go you can see colors of it looks a lot lighter there yeah slide down not a lot Nick needed just 45 degrees you've got to give it your temper well what did you say is gonna do slaves and I'm saying topple it's doing a bit lava which is unusual for that everything a bit like gonna go it's gonna go it's gonna go if it gives you one block there I'll give you that slab Nick got its larvae in a minute not fully sliding it's not gonna tumble it's not on the top of lava no that's the slide well that's a long unusual smell of it what we're gonna say what when I see it I'm smell minty smell like that in on I mean you've got to think you old year old strains didn't smell a pineapple in our engine food things are today all party a full party but do you does he demand to spell out this so any people smell of it you know what I mean door you know I'm saying no no you've got it still and always hey we don't like to compete or you've got to and we does really really moved on since the days on it really yeah but it's not some people that love this is some people that love this although it's a hybrid yeah but the black domain is an app you know I mean that's a cross I should have wrote down what that you've got lights because of Afghans I think he's across to some of that northern lines cross summer car oh goody forgot when it's gone but is it Gloucester's on myself but hmm I don't know some people are gonna love it the people that love smoking action will love this platform that the ash smokers would love the taste of this but the foolish bunch more to do want that that real fruitiness more than like this seven tears to be dished of it I'm getting a peppery spiciness cross with that let Danny a little bit of citrus going on with um I'm just got to think of modern stuff now and how I'm tasting a lot of the modern stuff is it's ridiculous innit in automating yeah certainly tell you right you already need this flowing food give it a real kick it's a big gig they sweat on bow on that that's a really nikkor is this is where we kicked into a torn is just strength

to talk about that today but if you guys want to check out some of our other weed reviews we do have a playlist with all of our reviews and you can find that in the description and on the screen right now Dave I got to ask you though wedding cake so wedding cake is also known as pink cookies and it is a cross between cherry pie and Girl Scout cookie and it's known for having a sweet aroma and having a very nice flavor profile with some peppery and piney notes in there as well it's also remarkably high in THC testing in the high 20s very consistently alright and right away wedding cake is exactly what I look for in weeds it's very dense so when you grind it up you're gonna be surprised on the yield the smell is also very sweet-smelling but not none of the berry notes that you would find in other sweet strains wedding cake for me is just something that I love smoking and for Dave and I we actually chose a steamroller so steam roller kind of a cross between a bong in a bowl and definitely gives you that giant hit and very flavorful as well to go along with the amazing flavor and aroma of this weed it is remarkably medicinal it's fantastic if you have stress and depression and if you need a little bit of mood enhancement in your day this is gonna be the strain for you all right Dave so a strain that is both dense flavorful the aroma is there I'm assuming this is gonna be on the higher end of the spectrum but Dave I gotta ask you today Bama rating for wedding cake we really hit all the high points on this weed I really enjoy the fact that it doesn't give you too much cottonmouth and it really doesn't make your eyes too dry and all of that in company together with the flavor and the density I really have to give this a 4.5 out of 5 which makes it tied for first place on our channel alright guys so there you go if you're looking for a flavorful hybrid I think wedding cake is a pretty good choice from us guys if you want to check out some of our other reviews we do have a we'd review playlist on the description let us know how we're doing here on Bammer TV and for everything else weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "YzTIebjlcLU": "[Music] what it do welcome back this is another chronic close-up and today we're reviewing the candy rain by secret gardens and man it is no secret that this [ __ ] is some fire look at that super frosty nugs dark dark purple and right when i opened it it had a sweet smell to it very sweet smell then i like busted one of the smaller nugs open busted this one open and you can smell the gassiness of it it's a cross between gelato and london pound cake and uh it's extremely visually appealing that's what i look for when it comes to weed like a good mixture of light green dark purple a lot of orange hairs going on there this it's [ __ ] crazy looking let's see look at that stuff but it's hella fire we got griffin in the studio today with me about to fire up the blunt of this and let you guys know what we think all right what's good what up what's good you guys welcome back to strain tasters trips at griff got my homie milano cookies yeah we smoking some candy rain today now this is a candy rain from secret gardens now uh what would you say this was crossed with today london pound cake and their gelato i'm not sure if it's gelato 33 but i know they do have a gelato i've tried super fire now my first experience with the london pound cake i believe was crossed with that uh caked almond yup cake doughnut that stuff was super gassy super fired so i'm excited to see what this uh similar flavor palette as the cake doughnut with the sweet creaminess gelato gas you definitely get that sweet gassiness and uh we decided to roll it today in a [ __ ] raw paper with a glass tip and man that should spring smooth as [ __ ] yeah that looks like it's gonna be [ __ ] flame i've always been happy with secret garden stuff um they're more on the pricey side but tend to be always worth it i uh tried their mac docido gelato and now we're trying their candy rain this was a highly recommended by the bud tender at clutch so yeah man right off the bat that is strong flavor you get the yeah and uh yeah i'm [ __ ] with it wow it blows yeah no i really dig that candy rain is a is a dope act song from the 80s you know haven't heard go look it up and uh yeah man i really this weed like first things first it looks [ __ ] so visually appealing it's the weed that i love to look at super dark purpley weed [ __ ] hella frosted that's some fire that's the [ __ ] i grew up on is that purple and uh it's got the gas too like the ax effect is there it's not just the look like you open up the the jar and you're going to get hit with a sweet smell i'm sad we only bought a gram i should have bought eighth of that [ __ ] but you never know so i always buy graham next time i go there i'll probably grab an eighth but uh like i said you know if i'm gonna grab it next time that should be a good indicator it is top tier gas yeah that's something that i like for sure i love gelato and i've been more uh inept to try london pound cake mick crosses because i like the cake doughnut too yeah the gelato that it really that flavor really sticks with you on this one oh yeah man it blows hella smooth in that glass tip bro we're going to start smoking with those oh yeah highly recommend if you guys ever get a glass tip for your blunts or joints shiver and smooth as hell but we had to use like a that whole gram in that [ __ ] that's a fat ass joint looks like an eighth joint but it's just a gram it's true damn yeah that flavor is incredible i think uh i'm already kind of feeling super high on it um yeah i believe it's like an indica dominant right london pound cake uh the last one we did that was indica dominant and gelato is like a balancing grid so it might be slightly indica leaning yeah it feels like it's it's a little bit into kalini yeah i was already a little bit kind of keyed too but like i'm definitely feeling a little bit more of a head height i say it's pretty strong stuff what's the thc sitting at um 27 [ __ ] it's up there yeah not bad at all yeah i uh i would give this a solid gas rating like [ __ ] 9.5 yeah it's fire you can't go wrong with it i think it's better than uh just a regular gelato to be honest with you i never reviewed that one but the regular gelato it didn't look as good as that i mean it looked fire it was purple all their stuff looks good but that looked better and has a better taste so i would give this high like the regular gelato i would probably give like a 9.0 this i'd give it a 9.5 yeah i'd probably give it a 9.5 9.6 yeah so we'll just round it 9.5 say yeah top tier gas all the way from secret gardens and like i said before man it should be no secret they got that flame that's true now they're the price range they're up there because they are fired but you're gonna get what you pay for so shout out secret gardens definitely if you guys haven't tried their candy green go look for that and like i said you know i'll pretty much stamp any strain they got because i liked pretty much everything i tried for them so far as long as it's fresh as long as it's working you know what it says it is i'll have to find some more of it sometime this is uh my first experience trying i like those jars too i like that little octagon yeah looking dope definitely cool display i save them you know like other jars you tend to like throw away those ones like they look [ __ ] dope to read yeah that's more [ __ ] the hell yeah candy rain 9.5 and uh yeah man good looking thank you guys for tuning in yeah thank you all on the next one [Music] you", "Xqi5JUhddyw": "one two three what's up pop peeps it's your girl pop mom 420 and i am back for another product strand review pot peeps you know i'm always excited so today is nothing different but i am like super excited i know i've said that before but today i'm doing a strand review on cookies the one and only cookies pop peeps now i'm pop mom 420 so i you know i ain't trying to brag enough but you know i i don't smoke a lot of strands especially being here in las vegas nevada i've had probably a good 200 to 300 in the last year but i haven't had cookies and and i'm trying to figure out why haven't i had cookies so shout out to burn on the team in california but pop my 420 never had cookies guys so here's the deal so cookies if you know is out of california by burner a lot of us know him from the rap culture he's the cannabis and culture guy i've been doing it for years and i must say californians are a different breed when it comes to cannabis when i say they know that [ __ ] oh my california pop peeps y'all know your [ __ ] i mean y'all been just growing this stuff forever and i'm just always so jealous of that cookies you guys i've seen in california stand in lines for hours before social distance before you know the pandemic you know you guys will stand in lines for cookies a drop of strand and you guys will be out there for hours and i'm like wow i have to get a part of this culture and every time i would go people would be like yo you missed it and i'm like it just came out today thank god bernie and his team they now have a grower here in las vegas nevada and it's called tahoe hydro or the hydroponics company but for sure is taiho hydro company they are out of carson city nevada so they grow there and now cookies i believe is a part of their growing uh family so this particular cookie strand that i'm gonna present was grown with tahoe hydro so shout out to you in the cookies family because now here in nevada we get to have cookies so i'm so excited so shout out to essence right here in las vegas nevada um i went there they seem to be the only one here in las vegas that has cookies strings so and they run out fast so i wound up scooping one up and the one that i picked up is this one it's just iconic to have the blue bag it's just ah it's just exciting so this one in particular pop peeps is called project 4510 um this one was just packaged on 5 18 so it's nice and fresh i wanted to make sure um when i called over essence that they had plenty of them so they had just dropped the batch so i'm like so excited that i got a chance for essence and shout out to essence team they really do me well when pop mom calls so i now have project 45 10. this one in particular is testing 21 we're gonna get into that because we got to go into some of the qualities doing this uh product review it has carol filing this is the terp profile six point four y'all know i love me some cara finally limonene love that 5.1 and it got a little mercy so it's looking like this might be a true hybrid so i'm excited about that and i'm gonna go ahead and get into this it says this is an indoor um flower now i do know for a fact cookies only grow the best kind of buds so i'm expecting that all of this is gonna be great so listen did my cameraman just smell that like seriously as soon as you open this up it's like oh my god like you literally i need a mask to put this on this is gas this is what you call gas people now i normally don't use that terminology because the young folks done ran that term in in a hole but this is gas this is so pungent i just had to get up close pop peeps to let y'all see this thing right here uh smelling of it gives you like the first sense of the high in a way so i like to do that then the next thing i need to do is touch it like i gotta touch it i need to squeeze it i need to see if it stays in shape does it fall apart and this right here is sticky the trichomes and all that good [ __ ] stuff on it so it feels like if i press this in my rising press i would get so much good oil out of this so that's the second part the third part is y'all know what i gotta do i got hot grated about that so we're gonna go ahead and test this out and see what the numbers are on our hot great device and pop peeps if you don't have your high grade you know what i'm gonna say get one now y'all know i'll be playing i don't lie about my high grade that's saying it's 24. am i wrong that's saying 24 now on the back of the package it's saying 21 now are we mad at anybody in this situation hell to the no this is saying 21 my device just said this took this up a whole another three points so we had 24 with the high grade so one way or the other this will knock us off our ass that's all we gotta say it's gonna knock us off our ass so i'm excited because like i said this is my first time ever experiencing cookies y'all know i got my trusty crystal pipe any pipes companies crystal pipes out there make sure you hit pop mom up because you know i'm always looking for a crystal pipe pot peach the reason why i use this crystal pipe because it never lies to me if i actually put a little small bowl in here it's disgusting it's going to taste disgusting when you wrap things up in paper that kind of mask everything so i like to keep my bowl clear when i'm first testing out that doesn't mean that every time that i'm gonna smoke my cookies gonna be out this pipe it's not but when i just wanna do it with friends and right like really just have that intimate moment it's just me and my crystal pike whoa i surrender whoa okay let me just explain what just happened first of all i went to go light it and i only needed to light like a little teeny piece so not having my hip wig definitely went too far but let me say something that that hit is and you know how you have that cough in your chest but it's not lingering in my chest like i got that little piece out that first like initial hit i'm sorry five people i just had to take a second because it threw me off anytime you hit a crystal pipe a bong it hit your head so fast is you ever had something that just took your breath away and then you got it back and you still didn't know what to say that's how i'm feeling okay i get what the rappers are going i get why they smoking cookies because that right there that one hit that's all i needed let me let me do that again cause y'all know how i roll pop peeps i i can't just do it once i got to hit it twice because wow look at my hand shaking jesus it's clean and you know how pot piece i said that gassy smell when you smoke it no gas like it's like where did it go oh that's good um essence can you make sure i get all the cookies from that one because i think that's all i want to smoke is cookies this is okay burner you got me i'm a cookie fan i see i didn't want to jump on the bandwagon because old frappus was talking about cookies and i was trying to do my own thing as pop mom but i think i like cookies y'all i'm a fan of cookies now i am and to show y'all i'm a fan i'm gonna get more of these cookies different ones and i'm gonna do strand reviews on those too i really like cookies okay so let me get back to my point because i i clearly don't know what my point is anymore um shout out the cookies maybe that's just the point and today's lesson is don't doubt burner and his cookie team because they they [ __ ] is quality even with it being in a bag is quality um cookies i do know is coming to a city near you pop peeps this is where you come into effect you have to vote for legalization so you can see cookies in your town i do know on the east coast um in my home town or near my hometown in philadelphia cookies has come to like the dc i think it's new york jersey area so that's exciting for all the east coast people with legalization happening cookies has already put their footprint on the east coast so actually when i go to the east coast i'm gonna see if i can find some more cookies but overall i'm actually impressed and maybe i'm saying this in the wrong way i want it to be unimpressed is that wrong okay even if it is it's high felt y'all i'm being honest i really appreciate this so cookies is definitely going in one of my top five uh as far as their growers um you all know i love a medicine flower and i love glp and now cookies gets to go into that group up there with their flour keep doing your thing tahoe hydro y'all are doing it have you had cookies so before you leave pop peeps let me end this with a question have you had cookies which strand of cookies have you had did you get it in california did you get it somewhere else let me know let's have a cookies conversation because cookies is the culture so i definitely want to have this conversation so pop peeps make sure you answer that question and i'm going to answer somebody live so if you reply back i'm going to go live and reply and respond back to your question or your response so pop peeps let's engage with this because cookies is here this blue is here to stay and now i know why all the rappers love cookies [Music] you", "ILyg5uCHp2o": "hey what is up everybody so check it out for this video I'm gonna be trying some of this is layer cake alright this cake is layered and I'm ready to try it out alright I like cake I like it you like it I like cake so this layer cake is 30/31 percent THC goddamn that is some strong flower right there alright I have to say that because I mean I think it only goes as high as 32 or 34 or something like that is like as high as flower is been reported so far and to have something that's supposedly thirty-one percent THC wowzers that is some extreme pot right there alright this is not your grandfather's popped all right so to speak I'm here to try it out alright I'm here to test this and let's let's put this 31 to the test alright is it gonna smoke good is it up to its name this is 16 dollars a gram for recreational 14 or 14 or 12 for medical but 16 a gram recreational so this is more on the high end this is more of that upper upper shelf it's not the most expensive but hey anyway so that's what it looks like I'm gonna show you Gary's I'm going to cut to but it's actually really nice it's got some nice denseness to it it smells great there's some more smaller nubs in here this is probably the bigger one in here but I mean it's overall nice it's got a nice aroma to it denna fluid got that like cakey diesel smell to it so I'm really intrigued so anyway so check it out I'm going to show you guys the but up close here [Music] all right so I'm ready to try some of this layer cake all right it smells fantastic 31% supposedly the nug looks great as you guys saw and I'm just ready to try it all right I'm gonna break it up here here's the break it's got a nice little break - nice little whatever - I don't know if you guys heard it whatever I don't care and uh I'm gonna load my bowl up here on this goober Zink rig this silicon duper zinc ring which I highly recommend that you should have part of your collection every stoner should have one of these rigs all right especially if you are somebody who travels a lot if you're somebody who's on the go a lot these rigs are very sturdy they work great this right here is glass so that's really cool if you're kind of like a glass head and want something you know it's not plastic you know I fully agree I would stay away from plastic as well but it's overall a very nice rig and if you're interested you can get yours at doers inc.com right now alright that is du BIR Zeit comm all right pick out your cool color selection alright enough of that let's get to the layer cake 31% from kind leaf no CBD and I honestly don't know it says it's a 50/50 hybrid but every single flower I've ever gotten from almost any dispensary says that on the bottle at least here in Oregon I don't know if it's like that other places I know it's not like that in Washington but here in Oregon most of them say 50/50 and usually they put that when they're like I have no [ __ ] clue so that's kind of what that means on the love so I'm assuming since it's got the tents of purple in there that it leans more on the indica side that's my assumption so anyway let's get this layer cake let's break into the layers that is this cake [Music] [Music] so I have to say that this layer cake is great it is right it is super turfy it's got like that sweet cake batter taste to it with a tinge of diesel and I really really like that mix all right so and it's really pungent it's there you can definitely taste it you can smell it it's definitely pungent okay and as far as the 31 percent goes I would say off one Bowl one full Bowl to myself I'm pretty dirty all right you know I definitely got pie I wouldn't say it's like oh my god I wouldn't say it's like that you know you think 31 percent and you think along that maybe if you're like a beginner or something that's you know doesn't smoke all the time or doesn't have us highest tolerance this would probably rock your world so this is not recommended for beginners or low tolerance users but definitely definitely something to pick up and try it okay especially it does the trick it does the trick I'm high I'm not like like I said I'm not like wool but you get what I mean like it's definitely I believe it if I probably smoked more of this I probably get to the moon and back so I definitely recommend it I can't wait to like roll a blood up of this and like have a whole blunt to myself of this this would be great so try it out and also if you have tried it out let me know in the comments section of this video what you think of the layer cake alright doesn't matter where you at it doesn't matter here in Oregon doesn't matter if you had in California Washington Nevada whatever alright let me know your thoughts on the layer cake did you like it did you think that you know it tasted good was it good at all maybe you had an outdoor version that was nasty I don't know so let me know your thoughts and opinions if you've had this string in the comments of this video so anyway that is my take on the layer cake I recommend it so if you see it in the shop definitely try it out if you're kind of wondering what to get remember this video remember this weird white guy who's like hey that layer cake is alright it's a little bit expensive but it's alright alright so if you like this video if you support this channel remember to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe if you'd like to see more content just like this and until next time I am out of here guys much love I hope you guys have a great rest your day and thank you for watching my video [Music]", "dGPNXa3votw": "hey Trevor Earth's ready leaf and today is Monday the 1st of June into June already on these reviews you guys we're gonna start this week off with an indica dominant hybrid from top Leif you guys made the choice between this one and the 15 grammar indica container from grasslands you wanted to see the super skunk review after I think it was four weeks of being up there you guys have decided that this is what you want to see so let's get into this you guys I'm very much looking forward to the strain I've heard some pretty good things let's tap into it [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back you guys I appreciate you coming and checking out the channel if you're new here if you guys have been here before I appreciate you coming back and watching more of these videos smoking some more dope with me so like I said in the intro we've got some Super Skunk from top Leif here this is gonna be an indica dominant hybrid with a THC total of twenty five point five that is pushing to that top and close to the 30% mark that Canada legally is tapped out at for its bud we've got a CBD total of greater than 0.07% and was packaged on the 17th of February 2020 you guys so it's a little bit of an older strain now that we're coming into June but top leaf has always done really well with their packaging and I've found that even though the buds can can be a little bit on the drier side they still are some of the best quality that that the market has right now pop leaf always does a really good job in these glass jars that they put in put the buds in help actually quite a bit because it doesn't pull any of the the flavors of terpenes and moisture into it that the plastic container seemed to seem to have an effect on but we've got the leaf Lee website for the Super Skunk we're gonna hammer off that information before we hop over into the herbage scale and really dive into this bud you guys so Super Skunk is gonna be an indica dominant hybrid and we've got the information on the leaf Lee website right here so let's read that off quickly a predominantly indica variety Super Skunk takes its robust flowers from its parent strain skunk number one buy back crossing the legendary skunk with Afghani genetics sensi seeds created a strain with dense thick buds that are known to be extremely pungent with surprisingly sweet taste this strain produces a bold relaxing effect over the body and is great answer for increased stress and body pains this sounds like a really nice indica for me those are definitely the type of facts that I like in a heavy-hitting indica I want it to be a body lock so I'm really looking forward to trying this we're gonna go into the effects side of this page starting off for the top five feelings you experience when you're smoking super skunk it's going to be relaxed followed up by happy euphoric sleepy and up lifted the top five things that it's going to help with you guys is going to be stress pain anxiety depression and absolutely not least in Somme Nia and the five side effects the the kind of negative sides of smoking this bud that most people tend to experience are gonna be a dry mouth some dry eyes you're gonna get a little bit paranoid sometimes dizzy and anxious are the last most common effects that people tend to have that are a little bit more leaning towards the negative side but that's gonna wrap up the information that we have on this we've got a sealed cannabis sticker let's crack into that and get this herbage scale going yo [Music] yeah so now that we've got it we've got the lift and peel here we'll pull that sucker off and get this urban scale going and whole when you've got bud sticking to that and the smell is just potent oh wow top leave you guys did a very good job with this but for how potent it's smelling out of the container and this - we're gonna we're gonna take that and we're actually gonna just rub that along the Buster and put that all in there so we can that makes me really excited when you see that it's just sticky like it is so sticky on here let's let's you know what's up in this container and see what this 3.5 Graham looks like straight up you guys so it does have a really sweet kind of a smell it has a little bit of a lemon hint to it so there's a full 3.5 you guys these buds are not dry but they're dense you can see they're dense and they're sticky they're really really sticky on my fingers it's I haven't had a bud that's sticky like this and all in the legal market in a very long time you do get that really nice skunky push but it it is really sweet you guys like way sweeter than I was expecting you get kind of that sharp acetone citrus smell - and that's leaning more to that sweet side as well because I mean I'm gonna give this a nine out of a 10 for its lookin aroma it it is and the crystal formation on this guy's this this bud is blowing me away right now like look at how crystal form that is you guys like it's just coated and it's sticky as hell oh I can't wait to tap into this bud you guys nine out of ten for its lookin aroma with odor don't I am so excited to tap into this we're gonna pack up the vape next and take our first tastes hey guys so we got this boundless vape set to the 175 we're just waiting for that tea cup to pop up and with this bud bus it up you guys can see it is just very flaky very fondle it together you guys can better look but it is very very fluffy and sticky even when it's about busted up like it is a really really unique smelling and looking button I'm I'm very excited to see how it tastes the 175 is ready to go let's take a first taste of the vape you guys when start off with this bump up to the 205 and 220 after that this 175 it's kind of the base that's interesting that's that's enjoyable actually the 175 is the base of the temperatures where you get just the first couple of terpenes starting to activate starting to boil off the really mild kind of flavor and effects you tend to get more of the lemon citrus flavor just because a lemon Neal Terp really is predominantly boiling off at this point and I'm getting a lot of that citrus kind of sweet flavor but it's got something different to it I can't quite put my finger on what it is but it's got something different it's very unique guys that it's almost herbal almost kind of like a watermelon kind of a flavor almost where it's kind of watered down we've got a bumped up to the 205 and I'm I'm gonna see if I can find that flavor at this temperature a little bit better yeah it's not that very kind of watered-down mild flavor but it's enjoyable you guys I'm I'm enjoying this vape at the 205 and at the 175 hmm the 205 is really mild it's really light it does have an very interesting kind of sour twist to it but I'm enjoying it quite a bit and we bump up to the 220 and that flavor continues to push through I can't I can't quite put my finger on what it tastes like it's it's very reminiscent reminiscent of something for me but I can't put my finger on it it's sour it's kind of gassy it's got kind of that sweet dullness that watermelon has it's all in all really enjoyable you guys we're gonna give it an 8 another taste from vape because like it I think if I could put my finger on what the taste is it would it would end up doing better but this unsure of what it is is bugging me but we're we're gonna pack up the bongs now and see see if this flavor keeps pushing through there because I hope it does you guys I really hope it does cuz I'm enjoying the [ __ ] out of this hey guys so I got the first bowl packed up here in this beautiful bong dubbed the madam this beautiful bong suka from red eye glass I really do enjoy smoking out of this and I don't smoke out of this long enough we're gonna take our first taste of the Super Skunk through here and see what sort of flavors we are gonna be playing with you guys let's tap into it Cheers [Music] [Music] hey guys so this is gonna end up getting a six out of a ten for the taste from a bong and it's gonna be primarily because the bud was really harsh when I was smoking through the glass and the madam was definitely the worst letting it melt get really milky and sit and spool and that and that bong usually helps and especially with the with that rig being as smooth as it is it's usually very very forgiving to the harsher weeds but this time it just it wasn't it was very harsh and all the other ones hit just as harsh a little bit of a delay I didn't get any really nice flavor until the last rig till the green machine and then at that point it had just just enough of a hint of lemon to kind of piqued my interest but by no means did it have anything that screamed out to me it was a little disappointing that way but it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't smoke it like I I enjoyed it I enjoyed the high that I got I enjoyed the little bit of flavor that I did get but by no means no where near enough to break a seven it's it's an honest excite of a ten okay guys so we got the crave straight pipe packed up here got some ham quick lit we're gonna take our first taste of this super skunk through the pipe and we'll see if it if it helps out at all that wind is a below and now that the rains fallen good time to be doing weed reviews to Joe hey guys so we're gonna give it a 7 out of a 10 for taste from up pipe and it actually has a really mild flavor through there I got really really light citrus when I was smoking it and it kind of goes into that glue strain type of an aftertaste that beezly kind of aftertaste but extremely mild for the intensity and it just it's nice and light but it doesn't doesn't really overwhelming with flavors it's enjoyable but there's a lot more that I would enjoy out of it if it just had more to give and the 7 out of 10 is the best I can I can give it right now just because of the lack of intensity of the flavor that that this super skunk has so we've got the joint here we're gonna like to sucker up and see how it tastes where we're smoking on some vibes rice papers again you guys always smoking on these vibes blues love how how there's like next to zero I don't even need to say next to zero I don't taste the papers at all all I taste is about and for convenience and ease those pre-rolled Rock caches are nice to roll these droids with because you could really haul off them I find nice big open ports I don't mind a Scooby Snack or two ooh I don't know why it took me this long to add this portion in you guys I'm going to straight out saying I was a [ __ ] idiot for not having a taste from a joint in here because there are so many strains that I think would just pick up and blow me away this is one of them really tart really lemon but not I don't even want to say candied lemon it's not even like that artificial cleaner lemon I I'm trying to place this lemon flavor it is intense but that the the intensity wavers from the lemon over into the herbal over into kind of a spicy almost peppery kind of flavor like black pepper it's really making me think of the super Lemon Haze live resin I had a while ago like a year ago [ __ ] probably over bro yeah but it'd be about a year ago it is wow wow this tastes from a joint you guys I am vaporizer the joint on this strain seems to be the way to enjoy it I am very surprised you hey guys now that I'm about halfway through this joint I think I can comfortably rate it with a nine out of ten it and the COFF now it isn't from harsh bud by any means it's not harsh it's that when you get really good cannabis really well taken care of when it's grown bud it doesn't matter how it doesn't matter how conditioned your lungs are you're still gonna go rolling trip stuff but does it to me pop leaf bud it does it to be it's really nice you guys can see that burn on there it's a nice white consistent burn and these papers [ __ ] love these vibes papers so much lately a nine out of a ten easily this bud can get it out of a town just because it's holding that lemon flavor all the way through and I am so surprised at how resonance the spot is like you guys take a look you can see it just seeping down there and on the end I don't know if you'll be able to see it you can see it starting to stick on that paper but my lips are quite sticky like I've got a good little your little resin stick to my lips but this joint very very well done top leaf and the ass just falls off I just put it over my ass trade tipped it and it just poured off wow I am I'm quite impressed going with the high now I can't give it a 10 I'm and I can't give it a 9 it's it's now that is it an a 7 or an 8 I think I'll have to give it an 8 its I'm not finding it's really overwhelming it's it's strong but it's not by any means a mind melter it's it's got a hell of a hold in the body hi it sits relatively comfortable any sort of stress anxiety be like any sort of wound up feeling a hat across my chest is relieved a is relieved very relieving as I was smoking it definitely has the potential to be a heavy hitter so any novice smoker lighter smoker I would I'd be cautious this because this could put you on your ass if you're not quite used to playing with with the strains that are at this higher percentage especially when it's at the 25 percent 25 percent but is pretty [ __ ] high I think I could sit down and play video games with this blood though hey guys even with how poorly this bud did with the taste from a bong and it's it's not that it tastes bad and I don't want it to come across that way it it it just it was harsh and it lacked a little bit of flavor you guys that that's my biggest biggest downside with this and I'm still gonna smoke it through the bong like I've got one more food I'm gonna pack up but I'm gonna smoke it with you guys and it was way better with the torch lighter than it was the hemp wick and like I I'm not gonna say it was horrible weed because it's not horrible weed it's still good weed it just it's not what I'm looking for in the flavor this [ __ ] joint blew me away taste from the vape blew me away can't give it a ten because I just can't it's it didn't it didn't need it tastes like and the look in her OMA this bud was amazing you you go into the taste from a pipe and it is me enjoyable but not the best and the high like overall you guys is bud this bud did pretty well looked great yeah yellow crystal on it always always crystal coated bud to me it'll always do better on the scale with fresh you'd be able to squeeze that button it's still sticky on your fingers that's that that usually speaks for a really good quality bud and with the fact that this is February packed and we're June 1st now like what that's awesome you guys I'm I'm really excited about that but now we've got one more ball packed up last Bo here YouTube

looking at one by weed me i think this is the third type strain i've tried by them i think i tried their wedding cake and maybe it was only one um but i'm excited to try a couple of their other ones because they've got a pretty good lineup of strains as far as i'm concerned so they've got another one called garlic jelly melon gum ice cream cake and tutti frutti this one here is called grandpa stash and it was intriguing to me because it's supposed to have a like a very piney kind of flavor which is what i really like so this one here is sitting at 21.65 thc it's actually got a decent amount of cbd in it uh in comparison to a lot of strains so it's sitting at 0.89 percent cbd grandpa stache is an indica dominant hybrid that produces big colorful buds with uh rich pine flavors grappler stash is bred by crossing super skunk and og kush and ashvan kush so the three different strains there we'd me grows in a 20 000 square foot facility they use led lights to reduce environmental impact and remain energy efficient rock wall cubes are used as a growing medium we meet hand trims in pharmaceutical grade clean rooms and weed me is located in concord ontario okay so this one was packaged on november 23rd so fairly fresh okay so let's get a look at it here not a huge aroma off of that right right off the bat um but we'll definitely get you guys a good look at that so now that we've learned a little bit more about we me and grandpa stash the last thing i got to do is test out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right everyone uh after testing out the grandpa stash by weedme i mean it was pretty good it wasn't what i expected i'm hoping some of their other strains will be a little bit better like their garlic jelly i'm super interested in so i'm uh i hope big things for that one but so far i haven't been super impressed by this company i've tried their wedding cake the grandpa stash and i believe the blackberry gum and none of them were super super impressive uh definitely not bad at all but uh nothing to uh ride home about so for this one the effects on it were good you know they're good enough for what it is but at 21.65 thc you kind of expect it to be a little bit more powerful they were good nothing nothing crazy the best thing about it is that it was nice and smooth definitely nice and smooth for sure on the throat the burn on it was good nothing great but definitely good the ash on it was not super dark but it wasn't super light either so somewhere in the middle and then the taste on it that was one of the reasons i was excited about grandpa's stash is because it was supposed to have a very piney flavor so no pine didn't taste pine at all the taste was okay like not not bad or anything just just okay but definitely no pine maybe a little earthy but nothing spectacular so overall i'm going to rate this one an 8.4 out of 10. until next time guys", "VqRXAxmpl-o": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene this is episode 5 in our 2020 strain review series this week featuring a strain we like to call slur Akane this is a purple punch cross and it is absolutely fantastic on paper we're gonna try it out let you know what I think of it right now here on the ice smoke channel join me as we talk about the background of the Slovak own cannabis strain so this strain has been bred by in-house genetics dos Eidos crossed with purple punch is the cross that results in the slur akane it is not available as feminized seeds according to the seed find a website and people's reports of it I've read some reviews of it online seem to love this strain as an afternoon even in smoke very indica dominant apparently there's some berry notes that are going to come through as well this is actually in a biodegradable bag which you don't see all the time so it's not in a glass jar but the bag is biodegradable so we're not going to complain there I want a big up right own extracts made some extract out of this but not before I've got to grab a little bit just to make sure that I could feature it in the review video so thank you very much my purple punch and dosa dose I am NOT the biggest fan of dos DOS it looks amazing 10 out of 10 bag appeal and people seem to like it but not my favorite strain purple punch on the other hand I absolutely love Larry og of crossed with granddaddy purple I think it is and that is a phenomenal strain granddaddy purple you literally taste them purple hoping that some of that does carry down into this slower cane I don't know anything about the growing method I don't even know who the grower of this one is really for this channel let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis stroke getting this out of its bag then been a long time since I had weed in a plastic bag I will tell you that usually we're talking glass jars sometimes my lower packs but I like to biodegrade bonus the first thing to mention is it is absolutely caked in trichomes it looks frosty and it's frosty as you like really really strong tricone coverage the buds aren't actually what I expected them to look like and I think that might be something to do with the grow itself the reason being if this is an indica dominant strain so I wouldn't expect these small sativa looking lugs or smaller buds this and this was run into extract which is why there's still bits of stalk it doesn't matter as much when you're extracting it and running it through a Pho other than the bits of stalk I think that the coloration and trichome coverage on this one's wicked it's just the look of these buds sort of suggests that something might have gone wrong during the growing cycle maybe a lot left on when it should have been or come on when it shouldn't have done something like that actually looks a lot like weed you pick up in Amsterdam and I actually did ask the guy was low is this import and is that nice grown in the UK I see this all the time when I go to them this is like haze it's like what the standard damn haze would look like right nuclear green it's got a real skunky look to it but then just full of frost frosty skunky look to it pistols are a muted brown color not even very visible actually looks alright not ten out of ten by any stretch of the imagination not the best looking but still got a nice look to it just hasn't developed in the way I would have expected let's talk about the smell of this lower cane so the online information when you look across multiple website it says creamy OG with an undertone of tropical blueberries now when I'm smelling this slur Akane and particularly this batch of it I'm not sure the tropical is coming through so much it's definitely got a creaminess to it and there it is you've got the gasp of the og and then just a hint of that that blueberry sort of or berry not even blueberries just berry just a sort of fruity mix hint right at the end of the inhalation eat or breathe it nice and deep to try and get that not super smeller like some weight I've opened a bag in a bit like whoa throwing smell up my nostrils like this is not the same even sort of really squeezing it it's not got a lot so that's her potential that is coming out and again put that down to this particular batch don't put it down to the strain itself I'm sure there's some Terp heavy slower cane out there on paper dicey does cross with purple punch sounds great but I do think that don't see those crosses can be a bit watery I don't know about you guys let me know what you think of this in the comments but I really don't like dough lotto and actually smell wise the slower cane isn't really overwhelming we-we've smell so I wonder whether that's gonna translate into the taste speaking of taste let us move on and talk about the taste of the slower cane cannabis strain two methods of consumption for the slower king my trusty chongs Widowmaker bun my mighty vaporizer were smoking it and vaping it should give me a good idea of the flavor that this bud has to offer let's just break some of these stalks out because every single little bud has got a little Stoke attest I don't want to be smoking there this smells like an OG mixed with parma violets or lavender mmm it's really nice actually it's not strong and it's not super apparent in your nostrils this isn't what I would deem offensive smelling cannabis if you don't like weed and someone had this in their pocket you might not even realize but whipping it nice and closely you do tend to get that creamy OG violet pom and violet stroke allowing the types meal we're gonna smoke some we're gonna avoid some we're gonna see how it treats us in this section let's just get everything ready let's prepare our vaporizer and then that way I can turn it on because it's gonna take a couple of minutes and what that's heating up we're going to smoke the bong and I'll see you Oh other side Cheers [Music] that went down really smoothly a lot smoother than I was actually secretly expecting it to go down I did think having a look at the appearance and smell of it that it might not have been the smoothest smoke but that shows me that appearance and smell is not everything that went down super smoothly so much so that we're gonna squeeze another one in and I'm we got to the vaporizers ready Oh got a little bit of time my dad would do it join me for this and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] super smooth smoked cool doesn't really make me need to cough there's not much flavor to it that's what it's lacking in the Turks in the vaporizer it's got kind of an old-school og that's really interesting I had that taste for years what is that it's got kind of like a traditional we taste in the Veda just kind of tastes like like Jim realized cannabis taste but in a nice way I mean I like the flavor of cannabis in general so I'm typing I'm feeling it trying to pick out and see whether that any of that violet or the Parma violets or like the lavender final it's the color not a flavor Tyler what you saying I'm talking about lavender palm of violets is the sweet what flavor it out I'm trying to get that now through the vapor but I can't detect it so much yeah this one hasn't got a lot of Terps in its not reached it's sort of Terp potential and I don't know whether this is me having been fortunate enough to be smoking nothing but no-till for the past I don't know three or four months so I've really gotten a full flavor of potential of the weed I've been smoking I'm not getting that from this so much he still tastes clean that's the really good thing about it it just doesn't taste like much you know I mean and this could well be part of this lower cane flavor so what I want to know from you in the comments if you've tried it because I get wateriness from dalat oh right don't lotto don't doze Crosby gelato this is dosed doze across with purple punch tastes a bit like watered-down purple punch you know I mean maybe it's the dosa doze that I'm not enjoying let's talk about the effects of this slower Akane as I talk to you now and as I grind up for another bomb the effects are starting to kick in this is an indica dominant body lead hi it's gonna relax you it's gonna make you feel good and I'm starting to feel that right about now actually yeah I'm feeling a nice sort of body lead but also slightly cerebral like just nice this just washing over my body and a calm just washing over my mind actually in fact kind of notice in different sounds in the air a bit more definitely kind of it's an enjoyable smoke right from how this high starting to kick in this is the first time I've ever smoked it never smoke slower came before I haven't smoked any in the build-up to this review just read about it I've got no resistance to this profile so it should hit me quite hard for what it is as opposed to think I've been smoking for a week now that being said I'm feeling a niceness just wash over me a mildness a kind of relaxation even in smoke don't turn off and we're done with you and I like to smoke invite one after the other cuz it gives me kind of a sense of you kind of feel it as your vape and you feel the high creeping in if you just vape on its own you don't really feel it creeping in with if you get bummed first and then hit the vaporizer whoosh you get a nice little nice little right maybe sort of a mild tiredness washing over me at this point it's considering it is still or it's just about the afternoon when I'm filming this feeling very very chilled out could definitely sit and watch TV or play some video games and it's a nice high you know it's got that kind of and I guess this comes from the granddaddy purple side of the lineage that kind of like hug hi where you kind of feel like like a warm hug do you not I mean it's a really nice really nice sort of feeling I think it goes all the way back to the Afghan strains and then into things like lavender into granddaddy purple through that and then through the slower okay so yeah overall effects wise I'm really happy with this higher it's a nice distinguishable high from other highs you know it doesn't just feel samey it doesn't just feel like I'm up or I'm really there's a lot to it it's complex you know and I like that about it that about covers the effects unless something's up so today we've been enjoying the slower cane at cannabis Train not sure on the grower of this one but I must say is not the not scored top marks from me on this occasion despite the appearance of it being a little bit smaller and the smell of it being a little bit less chirpy than I was expecting the high of it was still really really nice now flavor-wise a little bit on the wall to reside and I'm wondering whether that's such an egg thing that those dos talk to me about dicing those in the comments come on I want to hear from you don't heed those experts effects wise I love the effect of this one nice warm relaxed body lid - a nice and chill in my mind as well just gonna smoke this bong join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] yeah just like watery type you know it could be like literally part of it interest in it stuff I like it but it's not getting top marks because of a couple of factors that we've mentioned in the review but what do you think of the slur Akane and what do you think of this strain review do leave your comments below and remember to hit that like and

quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with tom ford kush so this is a really good strain i can tell by smelling it it almost smells like the white wedding which was a really good kind i tried from the liquor store and it was like 40 something bucks for three and a half it was like really really good so let's smoke the big joint i roll to this and take a nice thorough review of the tom ford kush so it is an indica and it's 25 thc which it ain't the highest but it's up there so let's light this up [Music] [Music] i rolled a little bit of tight little tight but it's not the weeds problem it does have a very nice taste though [Music] so it has like a actually really sweet taste but it actually tastes really fresh too so let's pull a butt out and take a nice look at the buds too so this one here this is a very nice size bud let's take a nice close look at it so it's like a very nice color green with very nice hairs lots of crystal on it it does look very good so this is five grams but it's very compressed so there's one nice size buds and they all the other ones are about just medium sized butts but they are all very nice and it does have a very strong taste it tastes very delicious the best way i could describe it it's oh no strong flavored but it's really sweet and it's like strong flavor but it tastes really fresh you know some weed you can taste it it hasn't i don't know it just doesn't taste that fresh but this has a very fresh taste to it it's hard to explain but it does taste very nice like i said it's an endica it's 25 percent tom ford i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out i've ever met oh i can't talk i recommend this kind too it's pink island kush i'm pretty sure i've done a review on it before but it's a very nice kind too so if you ever get a chance to try the island pink skunk it is pretty good too it's 25 indica as well and yeah it's very good i'll take a bite out so you can have a nice look at this kind as well because it's another really good kind i do enjoy it has kind of more of like well it says skunk so it has more of like a skunky smell to it but it has like a very nice taste to it it's a little sour tasting but it tastes very good and deathbob is another good one too but i've already done a couple recommendations or a couple reviews on that i'm starting to feel pretty good up this stuff already it's definitely a good strain i'll give the taste of four out of five at least because it's a pretty [ __ ] good taste i was maybe even yeah i'll say four out of five it is a very good taste and i am starting to feel pretty freaking good so let me know down in the comment section if you have any recommendations you want me to try or if you want to see me do a review of it i'll try to get it out and we'll try it out so with that oh yeah i wanted to say if you i know i already smoked i didn't get a chance to review i smoked i was impatient but this stuff the willy wonka or willy's wanders by diamond it's a very good type of shatter i definitely recommend it sorry my dog does trying to get out or whatever so we'll end this off soon so i can take my boy out so with that i'll give the um account rating it doesn't look very big but it is very packed buds are nice and hard so i know this will get a good a good amount of it so i'll give it a three and a half out of five for a count by a four and a half a four out of five for taste so yeah i definitely recommend it you get a chance to try out the tom ford go get it for yourself or the willy's wand is shattered that's that's pretty good too it's by diamond concentrates so go try that and let me know what you think about it like i said if you have any recommendations here you want to see me try put it down in the comment section if you like these please subscribe for more they'll be coming up two to three times weekly i can't do daily all the time anymore because i got some [ __ ] i gotta take care of but i'll be here as much

cockroach it's the instruction manual all good [ __ ] now here it is so the piece itself is badass it's small as [ __ ] thank you yeah take so you can see how big it is in comparison to y'all look bigger we containers me it's small in your weekend here wastewater smallest [ __ ] which is awesome now what does it's got this mouthpiece right here there it is I don't know how to turn it on it's got this mouthpiece here it's real simple it's magnetic pop it off a little screen in there see you can see easy cleaning they say this little piece comes out in these clicks back down and sweep up the weed that's it so I think you just you hold this yeah there you go boom five clicks get that [ __ ] I'll just tell you what time it is cuz you're warm isn't sure it's three o'clock at 70 degrees I hate that call uh this is badass alright so now I don't know what to do um see there's a temperature said he'll give you Ted that's exactly what you want you can go down to down to okay down 200 and up to 480 then look like a 220 225 I always felt like that was like a nice vape number when I did my house I had an old-school so isn't that nice yeah you said it any time but you want specifically that's badass this thing's gonna be nice that's probably a steely driver for me like the shit's real clean tell you what the temperatures and she like I'm sure I can [ __ ] with that leader o'clock on there right at 72 almost in here get warm and so now that's it okay so I'm gonna um so we talked about when you guys get one of these which is cool as [ __ ] and that's use your brush and [ __ ] like that let me get medicated another question is high affect how you turn it on that I really don't know that like I don't make the V you present work right so I'm actually just see how [ __ ] [ __ ] well cook there's just a to date use up no a set designer temperature instead with long press the power button for two seconds to start heating by every twice we need to feed your temperature setting do you stop heating long press the button for two seconds stop heating so apparently you just click it it's gonna turn on and stay on is he press it yet doesn't make sure you know that it's not you press and you hold it you press it twice it's gonna stay on and you hit it press it gonna shut off um it can maintain the set temperature three to five minutes so you don't want to leave this on running for three to five minutes cuz I don't think that'd be a smart idea um say three or five minutes setting so yeah that worked so again if I [ __ ] this up the first time I want to use it my dad what do you feel badass and I do think you're hungry and like every good meal with this hooking you guys up with this that's what's up let me break this marijuana stick some in this yo can be anything you have ton of that blueberries I'm going to break up your ton of it so I don't really know how much you have to use I brought something like 10 like two walls and that's kind of split up into sections and shove it in there I'm gonna probably want that cleaning tool master bowls I don't even need that much oh yeah that's what I have so I'm off this is gonna keep hit heating and I just keep hitting it I don't know I've no clue not really used to using these I'll find out I saw huh go to 25m hit this [ __ ] well there we go on the front of the screen tells you it as it's going up to 168 tell you what the temperature is going up right now that for the best you know it's that temperature I guess hit this [ __ ] No no no not yeah and yet never doing right away getting is going down now okay so that didn't really work for me I'm gonna try to uh and look at the singing side here I think I you do like a longer draw I'm set my temperature off I'm gonna go up like 350 so no include the [ __ ] I'm doing movie honor 325 let's try 325 I only had a way to love making any happen we're try this [ __ ] again no no 325 okay watch what happens I laid this [ __ ] up this if you see it watch watch temperature resin you see gonna pop we can see ain't hot that temperature says cuz field you could feel vibrate I see what's happening at 3:25 what's doing smoothdraw oh they have a prize [ __ ] I'm gonna stop this for a second I'm gonna take this cap off here and it does look like I'm slowly vaporizing this weed I think I'm getting slowly medicated I don't really know how this [ __ ] works here I think like I think we have vaporized he doesn't really do too much presidents out which I pack this down a little bit here let's see if that helps a little bit that's known that's gonna make a big bit of a difference here I'm gonna pack that [ __ ] down on it okay I can't this [ __ ] out again okay okey you know I think we have our idea now hold on I think it's key thing you want to pack that [ __ ] I don't know you know what guys we'll figure it out enjoy trying to get ladies let me know you're not at work this yeah I'm not sure what the we days like fire let me know okay but she's definitely still get one he's 32 meters what's up guys I'm back [ __ ] I still got here [ __ ] Medicaid chip yeah so what what let me do is I'm just gonna turn this [ __ ] back on and let this sit on and see if that makes any kind of a difference guys I love that shaquita seein up to 325 right now then what the weeds if I can just sit there and it maybe if I sit down on a fake [ __ ] so I'm gonna do this ball lets it to never trying to hit it before [ __ ] roll out okay that temperature is I read weeds in it oh [ __ ] works exactly so if I should sit in there heat up all their [ __ ] it's got a timer on it too that's that three it's not three o'clock I'm [ __ ] [ __ ] your son it's a time that's counting down let's go off in two minutes so it's heating up this whole time [Applause] there we go the other nice is about a minute left on this thing so you get a nice and they smooth there's kind of uplifting feeling like they kind of walk me up a little bit I'll definitely you didn't shave a shirt so now let's see if this thing does anything nice but sitting about 54 seconds left on the face we pull on it I'm not getting [ __ ] so I don't know how to work this [ __ ] oh I would love so we'd looks like it's burned a little bit come on maybe it's just [ __ ] say it looks either way let me know works much [ __ ] if you guys win one there JC two Weaver's please", "wc-pup7l8I0": "[Music] so i got early today and they say the early bird catches the worm and today i got up early because i ran down to woodland hills and they had the drop for scottie pippen's flower and the reason i went to get this is not necessarily because of scottie pippen even though i know he's a great basketball player and got to play with michael jordan right uh but it this is my backpack boys and you put scottie pippen and backpack boys together and you figure these guys can do something good right it's got some let's check it out so i ran down there and by the time i got there there was already a line around the building and i would say i was you know three quarters of the way back it was a big line and it went really slow and it was really hot and at one point i was thinking is it worth it to stay it was hot there wasn't any social distancing people were smoking cigs in the line and i didn't want to say hey stop smoking you know not good right but we were there we had our goal and that was to get scottie pippen flower and i got lucky because a nice oops a nice person named alex who i guess works at cookies he does something with cookies uh was able to help me get in there because i was about to fall down the doctor was out of gas crazy right and i learned i can't do that anymore it was a long line it was really hot it was uh a lot of people all wanted me scottie pippen i just actually wanted to buy the flower but anyway you could see i actually got it and look how beautiful this flower is and i would say this flower has a very unique look amongst flowers it's purples and greens and browns and really incredible so we're looking forward to trying it today and so let me load vapor cup straw real quick i already got two scoops in there i'm gonna put one more in that's about three this is a sticky flower so it's not really going to fall out anywhere we'll tamper but you don't really even have to and you can see if it falls out it falls back into the grinder and i'm gonna stick this down into the vapor cup and what vapor cup does is it's gonna heat that flower that's in the end of the straw and it's going to let off the terpenes and water vapor and it's unlike any other thing i've ever used and i would say this thing has really good airflow and in a minute and a half the feeling and the taste both are incredible and from that one little bit i'm gonna get 12 draws and if someone really wanted to draw it out you can get 20 draws of flavorful flour anyway so scotty bippin comes in this bag and you can see it's got his number on it it's got a signature and it says backpack poise and five points and this flower has 29 thc which is right in the right rung to be a good flower right now number one is iog which is indoor organic gardens mac one it's the number one flower it's got 29 thc and that flower just grinned me out i couldn't even stop grinning that's why it's number one and so i'm hoping you put scottie pippen together with the backpack boys you have a release of cookies they gotta be thinking let's do this really good so we've got our cup set to 330 degrees and you can see i've got the vapor in the straw so let's check out scotty pip and buy backpack boys at 330 degrees so this flower is really really really smooth it has a wonderful cure on whoever did the cure and all that is just so wonderful you can take a lot of draws the flavor stays this is like a oh gee-ish sour earthy taste but i would say it has some og in it but it is incredible out of vapor cup as a vape if you just like to sit around this is a really wonderful vape but we're looking for the best and everyone's best is different and the best for the doctor is something that's heavy i've been doing it every day for maybe 40 years right long time and i've tried a different flower almost every day most of 10 years so we really understand what we're looking for and how to describe it and i would say this flower really gave me heavy eyes i would say it had some focus it definitely wasn't hazy i would say this flower was a medium heavy weight it wasn't a super heavy weight there's much heavier flowers than this and i would say this flower is kind of a cruiser meaning it wasn't too heavy it had just enough focus and it was good flavor was good so what do we think we're looking for the best what do we think of scotty pippin by backpack boys i'm giving this flower an 865 which is a really good score it didn't grin me out it's not heavy enough to grin me out and also it wasn't you you fork enough to grip me out but this flower is a good cruiser and i would say if someone tried this they would definitely like it there's nothing wrong with her it's a great flower if you want to try scottie pippen you buy backpack boys and i'm sure a lot of people are going to try it and you can put the comments down there see if we agree i got it at cookies woodland hills but this good flower is going to be around i wish scotty pippen a lot of luck with this flower i'm the doctor if you want to see vapor cup if you want to get a vapor cup you can see it at vaporcup.com i'm telling you you can't even imagine how good it is it just changes the game it's as good as the bong was when the bong was new this is the next level i'm telling you incredible otherwise i wouldn't talk about it like i do this thing is incredible if you're looking for strange go to wheat entertainment.com i have a lot of reviews up there it's a lot of information to keep you in better flower if you like the videos please subscribe thanks for joining in i appreciate tips my flower's getting better i bet yours is too party on my friends [Music] you", "GJHgFW6_4ss": "[Music] with another strange review and today's strain is grease monkey grease monkey is indica dominant and it was created by the lab of exotic genetics with an X and it is a cross between a gorilla glue and cookies and cream and I'm gonna show you a nice size no the biggest one you get all right again this is just giving my vaporizer corn this is greasemonkey it is in the codominant and when i say is in akadama knit it is in indica dominant it was more so for me for sure just gonna get this going alright aroma so for me this was berry gasoline ish it was very pungent very skunky a little bit sweet when you start talking about flavor profiles and it's still heating up you still got the sweet vanilla gasoline skunky flavor it wasn't altogether unpleasant not for me it wasn't it wasn't like the smoothest you know smoke that I've ever had but it wasn't the worst either so it was right there in the middle if I confess on a scale of dankness it was like medium dink so it wasn't too bad for me it's a windy here so you won't see anything as far as like the medical benefits of it I read anything from helps with depression insomnia which I completely understand pain and inflammation loss of appetite nausea so it was a really really well-rounded strain the side effects reading them they said energetic you know it makes you more energetic makes you more focused creative for me personally the one that kind of stood out was just you know it it knocked me out there was no euphoria there was no I mean I was focused on keeping my eyes closed but like sedation I mean it was a really good one for that when I tell you that after I smoked this it was like couch lock city for me or for me it was bad luck and they said it helps with you know loss of appetite and usually there are some strange than you know give me the munchies this gave be for sleepies I mean I was done for the day okay and my husband would tell you it was like I don't know what you reviewed or did last night he said but babe you were out and I was not just out I was snoring out I was out all night there was no waking up for me I did there was no tossing and turning I was like the sleep of the Dead and I woke up the next morning and I felt you know I felt like I had a good night's sleep so when I talked to you about the strains they're gonna be you're gonna get a different feeling from maybe what I got so it's really important that you try different strains just really kind of even get out of your comfort zone maybe you have one like for me personally on a daily basis I've said this before I'm pretty stuffed between Harley Zoo and Charlotte's well I tend to straight towards the high CBD and low THC strains because this was a very high THC strain for me this isn't something that I would recommend for a newbie this is something that you know you've been smoking weed for a while you can handle this a newbie I would stray away from it unless you know you do your one or two puffs and this is something that you're looking for as far as couch look just be aware in higher doses you know they say they can create sense of panic and I kind of get that blue with the smoke a lot of it but again if you're new to this this is not something that I would recommend if you're having trouble sleeping you just want a night in you want the TV to watch you for a change then then of course this is a great one for that what I smoke it again yeah I was smoking again if I was looking just to be done for the day seriously this is not one that I would smoke early in the day at all because I was done like seriously for the rest of the day so this is one that I would smoke later in the day if if I just really needed you know didn't I sleep I was really tired I couldn't get to sleep oh you know what ever reason but this will be a good one for that again greasemonkey THC levels anywhere between sixteen and thirty percent I don't know if I said that earlier I can't remember I did or not so it's pretty high that's why you know this isn't one that I'll recommend for a newbie because you can't guarantee that you're gonna get on the low end of the scale you might somewhere in the middle or somewhere on the high end so you you know it's really hard to say so again greasemonkey yes I would recommend it for people who are looking you know for that cold couch lock try it and see how it hugs your body responds to it your money body may respond differently than mine did okay all right guys that's it greasemonkey and we're out talk to you later [Music]", "PqER9EYVO7w": "what's good you guys jaden back with another video art in this video i'm going to be talking about marijuana now everybody wants to say marijuana is good you know what i'm saying it's healthy you know i'm saying it cures cancer and whatnot which it has good benefits is good you know i'm saying marijuana is good for you but the marijuana that that we are given the marijuana that we buy from the dispensary the doctors give us that's not healthy wheat that's not real weed that's gmo marijuana now understand this bro back in ancient times back in early early ages and whatnot bro they was not smoking weed every day 24 7 just to get high bro they was using marijuana as a spiritual tool to connect to the gods higher entities the spirit mouth and i'm saying to communicate that's it bro that's that's all that was using marijuana you know i'm saying they wouldn't they wouldn't be out here just to get lit or just to relax you know i'm trying to say they was only using it for spiritual practices or tools you know what i'm trying to say now understand bro that if you're getting your marijuana from a dispensary medical prescription or this someone that you just know that this is a plug and they're getting it from you know what i'm trying to say and you are not organizing growing your own weed or you're not getting it from an organic grower bro you were smoking fake military weaponized weak bruh and notice how i said military weaponized weave because bro listen bro back then bro before marijuana was illegalized bro remember when it was illegal they was using marijuana in the military when they went to battle breath they was using it the same way that you everyone is smoking no i'm trying to say same weed everybody's smoking nowadays they was using it in battle in the military and you're probably wondering like bro why would they do that bro do you see yourself when you smoke bruh do you see yourself bro you probably get lazy as [ __ ] i don't mean to cuss but you probably get laziest as hell you start tweaking out you know what i'm trying to say you start feeling depressed or something or like you start feeling weird about yourself like you just can't function right like like how you was when you sober bro you just you just not yourself when you when you're high bruh that's why they used it in the in the military bro because bro these people that will get that will get like high off the military weaponized weed in battle well they can't they can't defend themselves bro like they don't even know what's going on they don't even know what's going on bro this game over is wraps for them bro it's clip don't military weaponized wheat in the military against uh you know what i'm saying the people that was going in battle and they realized bro like oh [ __ ] you know what i'm trying to say this is this is a powerful dangerous what i'm saying weapon let's give it to the unknown saying us you know what i'm trying to say because this i'm not going to get into all that type of stuff but i understand but they used to know they used to move weed that y'all smoke nowadays in the military before it was legalized you know i'm trying to say but with that being said you got to understand that we he has his own uh frequency level his own vibrational level because everything is energy we are energy everything is energy everything has its own vibrational level now for example let me just use this for example right that we the we marijuana's vibrational level what i'm trying to say is right here and i'm trying to say right here right now depending on the type of person you are when you're high will determine where your vibrational level will be in so if you're somebody that when you smoke you know i'm saying you get high you start being paranoid you get scared you start acting crazy and like you just like act on like all fun and i'm saying like you're having a good time or like you just like pass out because you get too high that means your vibrational level drop down to the wheeze level so that means when you were sober your vibration was higher than the weeds level and then when you got high like i said it dropped down to the weeds level now vice versa if you're somebody that when you're high you're like completely normal like you don't even feel high like you're just you yeah you're relaxed but like that's pretty much it like you're just chill i'm saying you're trying to say that means when you are sober your vibration is lower than the weeds level but when you're high it raises up to the weeds level so that means when you are sober your vibration is so low that you need to smoke weed to get to the weeds vibration just to raise it you don't understand but i mean like bryce that's you is that what you know what i'm saying if that's how you feel like yeah you wanna like hey man personally me i want to keep my vibration as high as possible i want to get to the highest vibrational point i can get it i'm trying to say but that's just me though so i don't i don't smoke like that no more like me i'm gonna keep it a buck bro i used to smoke every day all day bro dropping bags on weed bruh i'm telling you bro i'm dropping dropping cash on wheat bruh just to get high bro and i wouldn't even get i can't get it got to a point i would i would only get high for an hour bro and then i'm going to need to smoke again you know i'm trying to say it and like bro i would notice this would bring me to my next point bro i would notice i started getting depressed bro i started getting sad bro you were trying to say i started like i don't even know there was nothing to be sad about but i would still find a way to be sad and i'ma tell you bro the chemicals that they put in the gmo fake marijuana they're putting in chemicals to make you like suicidal feel depressed feel bad about yourself bro because bro this is everything is made to destroy you bro i'm telling you they take everything that we love and they use it against us bro i am online bro i love smoking weed bruh like that shit's cool bro like to me i love feeling relaxed i like you know i'm saying like chilling i like having a good time with my with my people you know what i'm trying to say but i understand bro like this is not good for me this is not a good marijuana bro i'm saying it's trying to say it's making me lowering my vibration it's not i'm saying making me feel good you know what i'm trying to say so yeah bro i ain't gonna lie like it sucks bruh what i'm trying to say that it gotta be this way but it is what it is but yeah so they're putting in chemicals that's making you feel bad about yourself and bro i'ma say this bro some people might not agree with this this might be controversial but bro the chemicals that they put in the weed bruh is turning some of y'all you're feeling a little fufu you get what i'm trying to say the reason why they this chemical the weed that y'all smoke and turning a little fufu is because they putting a female hormone in the weed and the reason why they want to put a female hormone in a weed because everyone is foo-foo everyone's you know what i'm saying you get one trying to say i don't want to say in this video but if everyone is in you'll get what you're trying to say then we can't reproduce as a human race bro everyone they're trying to stop the human race bro if everyone is fulfilled how how are we going to reproduce you know what we're trying to say so that that's another thing they're putting in in the in the marijuana it's a female hormone so [Music] that being said bro if you're gonna smoke weed brothers understand what what's really going on with the weed that you're smoking bro i'm not gonna lie bro i ever give up weed probably not you know what i'm trying to say because i don't know for me lately because my vibration is so hard like lately bro when i smoke with you i i'll be eating i'm not gonna lie i'll be getting hot bro i'll be getting your heart okay i'm not bro i understand when i smoke i only smoke on a special occasion if it's a holiday if it's like a get together you know what i'm trying to say and i'm just trying to chill with my fam or show up just yeah just trying to chill like if it's an accomplishment like a milestone like i need to celebrate then yeah you know what i'm saying i get late i smoke i'm saying just to feel good but like when i smoke i notice like now when i smoke i notice bro like everything just enhanced for me well you don't try to say like my my my senses is more enhanced my like i see things for more what it is like for example like if i'm like high and i and there's a situation being played out in front of me like i know that situation like oh shoot i keep that like i know exactly what's going on what i'm saying this times ten you give them time you wanna try saying bro like i see more spiritual like like bro i don't even know bro i see more spiritual like like synchronicities like i see like more messages like symbols like like what they trying to commute to me like i i feel it more bro so for me i don't know it's not really a negative thing for me no more it's like i'm just more connected to the spirit realm and all that type of stuff now i'm saying i'm more connected to spirituality like everything's just more clear for me but i don't know bro i honestly i don't need it bro i don't need it like i said i didn't do it for like if it's a get-together holiday or accomplishment i want to celebrate but if you're gonna smoke weed bro just know what you're getting yourself into what comes with it if you're gonna smoke weed bro at least try to get from a natural grower or grow your own marijuana try to not try not to smoke gmo we no more bro because that's just not good for you but marijuana is good like marijuana is good organic marijuana the marijuana plant is good for you not the gmo the ones that grown in the lab because the ones that grow in the lab bro it has no life bro you know you want to try to say because bro it's grown in a lab if it's not grown in nature in the dirt under the sun it has no life it's not connected to mother earth so it has no life to it bro so if you don't smoke weed bro at least try to get organic weed you know what i'm trying to say or if you're gonna smoke gmo we try to try to take a break try to like do one every once in a while but hey bro you're gonna do what you wanna do bro i'm not telling you what to do i'm just here to let you know

trichomes will still be harvested and it will still be enjoyed yeah not gonna win any beauty contests but that's okay yeah that's where at that plant it's time has come the breeder seeds 'men seeds they say 63 days of flower until harvest I think we've gone 69 days and I'll be honest I'm just sick of looking at it alright so I've trimmed off all of the big fan leaves everything that I don't need it's not nearly as ugly now it'll be a lot less hanging in that tent creating humidity I don't want I've already got that other plant in there so it'll be a challenge to maintain the relative humidity in that environment hopefully things go well success right that's rather issue-free got it hung up there it's pretty bunched up so I'm thinking I'll leave it for a day or two and then I'm gonna do the same as what I did with that plant behind it and just separate the branches let a bit more air move around alright that's enough work for tonight and there's just enough room in there for it to fit in so that's good hopefully like Kerry Mulino dries up in a couple of days get it out get this one split up and hanging and drying and the big bud will be in there too before we know it anyways yeah we'll check back in a couple of days two of my cannabis plants are gone to remain in the tent for now back in the corner is my Remo chemo from Dyna femme seeds absolutely beautiful it's still got a bit more time left to go up front here who's the star of this show that is my big bud from sensi seeds this has been growing in a three gallon pot a 50/50 mix of happy frog and promix HP and yeah I probably could have used a larger pot would have got a larger plant but then again I managed to fill this five by five tent pretty well with just four three gallon pots so yeah I'm sure things are pretty rootbound down in there it's been in that pot for yeah quite a while anyways the plant is looking nice a lot of the larger fan leaves yellowed and have been removed even the remaining leaves are fading as well flowers have come on nice it took a while for the trichomes to really start showing up things there things are looking good my previous grow I grew Otto flowers and one of them was a big bud Otto flower also from sensi seeds and you know those flowers they resembled these ones they looked very similar the smell is very similar so seems like some good consistency from Scentsy seed anyways I'm at day 70 on the well past with the breeder suggested and yeah I think she's lived long enough her time has come the plant has been a pleasure to grow minimal training required I topped it once and that's it put in those bamboo Stakes to support the heavy branches but yeah plant basically trained itself it's really really awesome alright not sure how well that's gonna show up I got that big bud cut into three parts one hanging in there those four Center got the middle portion of the plant the other part back there that Alaskan purple running that way well it's been a week things look similar but I assure you it's different so that caramely know that was hanging along the back it's been trimmed up it's gone so now the Alaskan purple it got broken down into three sections and it's been hanging back there for about a week and then it's my big bud hanging down the center but yeah it's Alaskan purple it's it's dry it's ready to be trimmed so get it out of here trim it up real quick and yeah clear up the space for the next plant in the drying tent so this is certainly the least impressive of the four plants that I grew I don't think it has anything really to do with the breeder seeds 'men seeds I think it would be on the grower and water issues that I had midway through flower because I was buying water from the grocery store and it was suddenly unavailable for a short time I had used tap water that was not of the best quality this plant suffered more than the others there's a peak in the side door of the tent here that one in there it didn't suffer nearly as badly so yeah of the four plants I would say that the Alaskan purple was certainly the most sensitive yeah didn't really turn out too good so I think I'm not going to spend too much time trimming it up and a majority of the plant will go into a bag into the freezer and it will be dealt with later probably turned into hash or something yeah that's where we're at now all right final results that vote Oh 2 and 1/4 ounces just over 64 grams of stuff ugly buds trim just stuff and yep that bag will go in the freezer that'll be processed later and I got this one jar probably about three quarters of an ounce in there Bud's not trimmed the best what those cure and see how they turn out a few weeks to a month from now yeah that's it for the Alaskan purple good riddance onto the big bud whoa what a beautiful sight beautiful smells too then you know as the Big Bud is very very dry yeah it's been a goodness at least ten days maybe twelve days I've kind of lost track but it is dry and ready to be trimmed see the Remo kemo beside it hanging upside down it's got that different purple color to it anyways this is about the big bud let's get her trimmed down to the last branch - yeah it hasn't been going too bad a lot nicer to trim than that Alaskan purple I was just annoying to deal with really but you can see the structure of that nice little buds along the outside so it's going well yeah anyways get this last one trimmed up and see what the end results are well it took a while but the work is done got all the trim in the bag it was that later a ball beautiful buds yeah pretty pleased and then all these little popcorn buds too quite sticky to deal with yeah I'm pleased very pleased but we'll see what the scale says little popcorn buds we got just over 19 19 and a half grams in there 82 and a half so yeah not bad anyways yeah all right well here we go got her all jarred up yeah I say very happy how the big bud turned out can't wait to try it it's they'll spend some time getting cured and I've still got this jar here of the Alaskan purple which you can see not the prettiest but still give it a try the smell is amazing that's one one thing about the Alaskan purple huh the aroma is quite pleasant Big Bud is nice too but this just almost like caramel and flowers it just yeah very unique look forward to trying it so the big bud reminds me so much of the Otto flower version that I already know what it's going to taste like I'm sorry can't wait if you want to see how that Otto flower version of the big bud turned out I made a video where I go over my curing process and it featured that harvest so I'll leave a card at the end of this video and you can check that out and yeah see you in the next video for another harvest of my final plant from this girl we'll end this one here all right thanks for watching", "D4VVyX7Dl40": "for all you sworn enemies of GMOs that is genetically modified organisms or frankenfood who also happened to be

an essential cash crop until the war on drugs and other things that make sense shut that down now farmers who can't turn to any legal crops because with all the taxes they're subject to they're

people Cheers so hope you enjoyed them close-ups of the purple punch absolutely amazing flower and super effective and when I first picked up this strain no obviously we did the smell and the taste test and could not put my finger on what it smelt and taste like and then somebody pointed out that it smelt like Blue Parrot or like Gatorade or you know like the powdered drinks drink you get the paved mix you put it in a cup and then you mix it with water like an energy sports drink that's what I could familiarize this stream with I have a bit of a mind blank there so very tasty like berries

the intercept that's the gorilla glue number four across with the tangent Gorilla Glue number 4 across continue this is Teva it's pretty high cards Kaiba and they got in the shadow form now which is causing confirmed bands bugs also remember that served the shatter now in the parchment paper city squish it dab it up you're losing you losing your shadow from the old you know old school classic taneously started off with so that's awesome also secondly this is the first time they've offered to shed her in a full gram from used to be sold in half games I'll actually have it in one grand form

Daniel and we're back for another strain review today we are checking out some flour from a company that we have not featured yet on the show this is some garlic breath from pistol point that's right this is an organ company originally they just started popping up in Cali I've seen them on the Shelf that a few different shops I believe they're on the Shelf at Garden of Eden up in Hayward but yeah this stuff is Dave so this garlic breath it says right here Barbary Coast times pistol points so this was a collaboration between them I'm not sure in what capacity Barbary Coast collaborated in this all I know is it's exclusive to them it's the only place that you can get it Barbary Coast in San Francisco that's where we pick this stuff up the first impression and the jar appeal were what made us go with this one honestly it was some of the best looking flower that they had on the show this is a cross right here GMO cookies and a GMO being that chem dog GSC cross obviously that's where you get a lot of that garlicky smell at least when I had the GMO cookies a very peppery garlic the fire nonetheless we love [ __ ] with chem dog in it as you know having a lot more screens on the show lately they kind of have some of that old-school Kim lineage I don't know if I put this one quite in that class but a little bit of the influence in there this stuff looks incredible first off we'll just talk about you know the way the bud catches your eye when you peek into the jar I mean this isn't really what you want your [ __ ] to look like it's completely caked up the structure on this stuff is really really nice it's not you know it doesn't look blown out it looks natural but at the same time these mugs aren't banging they are banging not really sure what the THC percentage is on here it says 895 point three milligrams in the eighth so we're just gonna have to get used to this we're gonna have to figure out this conversion y'know this or just stop doing it because we all know the THC percentage doesn't [ __ ] matter but I always like to throw it out there but I'm saying it less and less which is kind of weird I feel like that's definitely a marketing tool so start putting the damn percentages back on there and game guys come on anyways garlic-breath it definitely caught my eye that's why I bought it but when you crack it it smells really good almost smells like Cash's grandma's cookies that's what I was gonna say so we've we've reviewed a bunch of strange lately crazy crazy names I forgot we've had this you actually did this the other day on the video we rolled up a [ __ ] cone or the strand of you forgot we even had it I almost just did the same thing let me just get this thing going real quick but we've been doing a bunch of strange lately gushers skittles all these different streams that have a name that implies how you would think it would taste or smell this one kind of falls into that category for me but honestly I'm not getting as much of the garlic thing as I have just even on some other GMO like you said it's kind of giving me that cash vibe that grandma's good mr. keen oh yeah I like the name but you're right I've had GMO and to me GMO should be called garlic breath you know that smells really garlicky to me this smells more you know skunky doughy very cookie ish I'm getting a lot of like every cookie almost like a really really really good form cut so growing medium on this stuff was a 50/50 mix of soil and cocoa that's kind of cool that they put that some of that information out there online on their website and stuff for people to check out they give you a little bit of info on how they actually grow their weed if more companies start doing that that might kind of be a cool thing to be able to compare because obviously we will have a little bit of experience growing in different mediums but most the time when I'm trying weed unless I get it from the grower himself or herself you don't know I don't know what it was growing it yeah yeah it's kind of nice to have that little tidbit of information I personally like soil don't I mean there's nothing against coca some of the best growers I know you scope though pretty nice to know that this was a 50/50 mix you know super soil and cocoa because you know I think Shane can say he probably likes soil too is just that's what I feel like it gives you a little bit more natural flavor of it brings out the flavor of what the strain should really taste like and I could be completely wrong but that's just my preference yeah I don't know why I don't know the reason behind it but personal preference for me soil again because of the flavor like you said for whatever reason we just tend to taste a little bit better but I would imagine there's you know a perfect mixture that you could find just like for you know hash oil we always you know a lot of people did straight butane a lot of people did straight propane I always like that like 70/30 mix yeah 70 butane sorry okay I'm sure there's a you know depending on the grower depending on how you do things I'm sure everybody has their own kind of sweet spot for their style you know yeah and growing medium is just one of those factors you know the effect on this [ __ ] is great bro I mean regardless of THC percentage or milligram each it's hitting me right between the eyes it's almost making me like get a lazy eye super heavy honestly for me I know it says it's a 50/50 mix but I think it's hitting me a little more indica getting harder and harder to talk but I do know one thing I know that 895 milligrams and 1/8 is a lot so I'm guessing that's gonna be somewhere around 25% I feel like maybe I am getting a little bit of garlic my taste now through the through the joint yeah a taste I didn't I don't smell that at all when I smell this again when I said oh this it's not that it reminds me more of like the OG k be cooking us or the Cash's grandma's cookies that's the smell for whatever reason that I'm getting that out of this but the taste is a little bit different and actually getting some a little different joint ya know I mean I can see why they called it garlic breath but it's just not as strong as some of the GMOs that I got when I smelled the GMO like damn that's one like sure you garlic shit's crazy super peppery this has some of that in it it's just not as present we should get a microscope to do these reviews that meets a little like USB microscope like a pretty decent quality one I'm sure that's pretty inexpensive now that'd be cool to kind of get an up-close look at just the trikes on it and get you know kind of the macro shot of the bud this stuff to the naked eye looks like it just has those tiny tiny trikes but they're just covered every however you live especially on the underside of the inner bud I mean it's got that typical really good top top shelf cookie look this was what top shelf cookie looked like when it first came around a little more calyx II a little bit so somewhat a little bit more crazy looking at you know but I don't know I just mmm I like the smoked purple crush almost every day of the week yeah this is close to it but not quite okay going on another rip from the bong here what would you go with this if we were gonna give it a radiance so I'm gonna give this one a solid 9 I think the flavor could be a little better looks our 10 effect is a 10 I'm very high but you know when when judging Bud critically it's also a little dry for my liking like like you can feel this now here there's really no moisture to it it's very dry yeah so this this bud a bunch of the last few strains we checked out have past the stick factor you know so this bud does not want a whole dick factor it like wants to grab it this is not sticky weed I would not you know yeah it's like this right this it wants to grab but it's just not sticking very kind of more of a dry resin or just not as sticky of a resin I don't know man I would say this wind looks really good it's something a little bit different I am enjoying it I don't think this would be something that I would smoke personally like on other faces it just doesn't pack quite as much of a flavor profile for what I'm looking for it definitely has set in kind of a nice buzz I'm feeling it set in up top I kind of work its way down really like the high a lot that's why I bumped it up nine might be a little generous but pistol when I'm talking with you on this [ __ ] I'm giving it a nine yeah I'm gonna go with an eight on this one like I say just maybe not quite it may be more of a personal preference thing on this one for me with the flavor but it is interesting this is I like to try something new every now and then and this is definitely something new I would maybe try it

where we are bringing to you on and unbiased cannabis strain reviews today we are going to be reviewing sour apple by green gene genetics these are some growers that we are familiar with here on our Channel but sour apple is a brand new flavor to me this is the very first time that I'm going to be trying any sour apple so I am really excited to try it out sour apple is a hybrid strain that is a cross between the ever-popular Sour Diesel and Cinderella 99 so let's go ahead without further ado let's check out this Sour Diesel I'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys right now and then we're gonna check it out together all right so you guys had a chance to check it out I am going to open this bud and see what is going on under the light here so a really light light lime green color - you guys I'm going to pull one of the bigger buds out here and then I want to look at this with you guys here so man that is pungent straight out of the straight out of the jar and it is definitely that it's funny it reminds me of almost the tangi smell they say it's our Apple you know so I guess I can actually kind of see that it's got kind of that lemony those you know that kind of citrusy Terp is what I'm kind of smelling here really compact buds you guys like these are really dense dense little buds here and they look to be fairly decently trimmed it was probably just run through you know what maybe wasn't run through a machine they could have hand shrim this I mean there is some extra leaf material here but the trichomes are just kind of average on this not super super huge but man it is some really stinky stuff this stuff is like got some major turf straight out of the jar here and I can tell you that when I ground this herb up all of that aroma came even stronger like all that citrus and fruit flavor was just released even more when I ground this herb up so I'm really excited to try this out because I have never tried sour apple before so today we are going to be enjoying this out of my Arizer extreme Q vaporizer set to 375 degrees Celsius for those of you in America if you're not sure what the conversion is look it up yeah nerds all right you guys but then I've got the fake that is being fed into my scientific inhalations bubbler that was just cleaned out with some rubbing alcohol I got a brand new organic cotton filter in there to ensure the absolute cleanest cleanest possible draw I want to report the exact Terps that I'm getting off of this ganja and give you guys the honest feedback about this so without further ado let's go ahead and try out some of this sour apple by Green gene genetics y'all so that was really light but man I got some of that some of that Apple eat sour apple flavor nice and smooth as green gene genetics always delivers not a bad first rip and we're really all of that flavor was kind of like coating my tongue right now it's like a candy it's like a candy I you know I said 11 before but it's not really lemony it's more of like the tangi flavor is kind of actually what I'm getting more than anything that's Han gerini tangy almost so yeah I can see the sour apple let's dive in for a second one and see if it it changes on the palate as we get that second trough [Music] you know my eyes get so big right at the end I love that that is hilarious and you know I can see myself here so I'm like it's like I'm stared in the mirror it's really funny so more of that sour apple flavor from this green gene genetic sour apple and I'm curious to see how the rest of this bowl finishes out and see you know if this is gonna pack a real nice sweet punch for me so while I am finishing out this bowl I want to show you guys this stuff up close and personal so you guys can get a little bit of a closer look at this stuff under the macro lens all right you guys so here it is this is the sour apple by green gene genetics under 25 times magnification macro lens and just like those sour apples this has got the color to match and then some peach colored hairs intertwined throughout there it's definitely not bad looking bud you guys real debts and this stuff is definitely definitely got a nice proportion of crystals and hairs ah right we are back you guys just had a chance to check this stuff out nice and close and personal and I just finished out this bowl and I want to talk about it now with you guys so I think the star of the show here are you guys for the sour apple it's the flavor it's like if you like these flavors you're gonna like this stuff this stuff is not super potent I am not getting any major effects you know they say this is a hybrid you know I would say that that's kind of the effects that I'm getting are just those mid hybridity effects not super up not super down but this is not by any means a knockout stuff you guys could use this as like a daily driver if you guys like this flavor I would say that for me it really it was like from the beginning of the end till the end of the bowl that flavor was kind of the strong suit for me I you know I can't say that it stood out in one way or another throughout the smoke process but before I give you guys my final thoughts on this I want to bring it up on the screen one more time so you guys can check out the buds one more time all right so you guys have had a chance to check it out now a couple times so let's kind of give you guys the final rundown so I don't think there's really anything wrong with this but I think for me personally it's just not my personal flavor choice you know but it was smooth and you know I think again it's like if you're into these flavors I would recommend this stuff now I will tell you this I am probably not going to be it's not not probably I'm not going to be getting this stuff again just because I don't really like this flavor I still want to give this stuff overall a 7 out of 10 because I think those terms I mean to open the jar to immediately have turps that's amazing and then to have that throughout the smoke process is great I'm bummed out you guys that this didn't come in that little small dope little jar that the g3 breeching genetic stuff normally comes in so seeing it in these like medicinal jars I'm not super and about you guys not buy than that if you want my honest opinion but you know I really do I think it was smooth and I think you know it could have it could have been better I think on the potency end of things overall you know it's kind of what my major major beef is in it and like it's it looks okay it just doesn't it's not knocking my socks off by the looks by any means this is just kind of average-looking chronic you guys so you know I think that's another place where it lacks for me and those two you know areas are huge huge areas for me and you know if it had some more either like you know a different fruit flavor maybe or you know cush I might have liked it a little bit more but again not to knock it 7 out of 10 is really good still around here I think that's kind of the average as I've been seeing for the green gene genetics product you know stuff that we've been trying around here so I'm guessing you know I would love to see him break that break that seven to you guys break that seven that's what we're hoping for around here and I was almost I almost threw this into the 6.5 you guys I'm not joking around but I'm gonna give them a seven I'm gonna stay consistent here because I really think that my biggest beef was maybe that flavor not super diggin it but until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and I will see you guys soon [Music]", "BCc3ik2M8GA": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] don't watch this video this video another stream of your video I did one video like this in the past you guys kind of liked it like it's getting a decent amount of views but that was like a wife's car I got another wax car I'm gonna do a review on soon that's coming up but this video is some some buds and fire ass bud this rain so the strain of this is called a Blackwater OG get some fire fire but she was like some little picture about with some information about this rain so it's an indication it's like a crush it's a cross between um Mendel perps and uh San Fran Valley og og cush so it's like really it's like a really really purple bug as far as [ __ ] crystal use for crystals all do the budgets fire and it's just purple on top of that you know what I mean everybody loves some purple we just like the looks of it like it's fire I got a couple close-up shots I I had some like about an eighth of this I smoked probably about two grams only got like two probably about a gram left but when I had like a little bit more blood I got some quote but when I had like about it eight left or so I got some closer look I got some close-up shots with this camera for you guys so I don't know how well they turned out I guess we'll find out right now so yeah that's the close-up shots at the camera they didn't turn out that good I'll guess they posted shot to my phone real quick with this last little nugge have but this body's [ __ ] fire if you guys couldn't help little close-ups that's what I got left right here so I got I got this snug left and then I got like another like a little ball or so I mean you guys already seen it but this boat is [ __ ] fired alright so just got done with this close-up so you guys seen it it's [ __ ] a [ __ ] fire Frosty the Snowman with a prequel they do it it's a stupid strain but um let's grind this up I'm gonna roll up one I'm gonna smoke a bowl for you guys the balls are gonna feel kind of like a taste test the plump me smoking it just showing smoking talking to you guys and just a little smoke sesh you know what I mean so let me go to ball real quick and we'll hop into that and then what I'm gonna be smoking the bowl out of I should have cleaned it a little bit better before I made this video but I got this every side piece and I should have said this in the beginning of the video I'll probably edit it in some more but um so I mean don't watch this video unless you guys are over 18 or 21 whatever the legal age is legal ages in your state or you guys have your medical marijuana cards like I do back into this video um I'm gonna load a little Bowl real quick I load about like probably loaded like half the bowl in a little full bowl because the mother smoked a blunt - but this is just for me to get like the taste because you know you get the taste more through a pipe or a water pipe more than up lump because when you smoke a blunt you're like tasting the wrap as well as the weed just use the bowl I loaded so all right so I was thinking I want to take one fat hit just like I don't know a little challenge or something for you guys but I'm gonna take one small like a decent sized hit just like actually get to taste I mean I've been smoking on it for a while so I know what it tastes like but just for video purposes you know what I mean I'm gonna hit it once kind of a decent hit just too good I'm gonna hit it once it's like a decent hit to get the full taste experience for the video and then after that I'll probably take a bigger city or something just happened so yeah this part is so fire dude like it was cured perfect there's it's not like it has like the perfect like you guys think that close-ups like it how I have that snap to it and it's like the perfect but you know what I mean it's not dry doesn't it doesn't turn it like you know that weed that turns inside [ __ ] dust when you crumble it off or this bar that's like way too [ __ ] moist and this part is like the perfect here you know what I mean so the taste is [ __ ] fire doesn't taste too strongly anything in particular like doesn't I can't really taste like though the SATA friendo Ju cush you know necessarily at all it tastes more like the Mentos perps and the San Fran would be cushioned this to be honest but if you guys had this drain in the past time I don't blow on the comments what you guys think of it but let's take off that I said of this thing get into that block the ball is pretty much cash so my grind of a bet I'm gonna grind up about a gram throw up a blunt probably get a little time lapse think me rolling the blunt or something I don't know yeah I just don't want this video to be too long then I'll get our back smoked tip alone I don't know if I'm gonna smoke the full-blown and I don't know if I'm gonna trying to talk too fast and I'm stumbling over my words I don't know if I'm gonna smoke the full blunt in this video just because I don't want the video to be too long but let's get him to me roll on the blown out in one second I'm gonna work on the wraps you guys like I like I bought once pretty much done just gotta pack the rest of it there we go all right so much I'm gonna strap my phone it's a while back in my backyard that's something kind of weird we're in my backyard and I got the blunt roll so yeah so I rolled the blown up added a little crutch to the end of it it was a little loose um it's not the biggest blunt you know I mean it's a little personal one huh thank you guys didn't know I had a dog or some of you guys might look okay why you scared [ __ ] what I don't know what the [ __ ] is going on with him but this is hot back into this video so yeah I got two dogs I got a two Alaskan Malamutes you guys don't know what those are oh it's like the dogs in Alaska like pull sleds and [ __ ] like that so I actually went I bought my dogs we had to go to the airport they arrived on a plane now we got to pick him up in the airport that's yeah that was blaze and then I have another dog sky hope you guys are smoking along with me and yeah let me know down below in the comments where you guys live if we just be or where you guys live like recreationally or medically all that and if it is and if it is tell me what your as his favorite strains are I got prefer indicas or if you guys were property bus' or hybrids me personally I prefer in the case I don't know I don't really know why I just I also have a really high tolerance seven smoking weed for [ __ ] just like I was young I don't even know what he want me to say it on camera but I'm not trying to brag it's not a good thing you don't smoke when you're a [ __ ] miner that [ __ ] is really bad for your health and just bad for everything in general but I'm just saying I have a really high tolerance when it comes to weeds I [ __ ] can smoke like this I'll be like in a different state you know what I mean like I'm not gonna say I'm not high but I'm not as high as some other people with lower tolerances would be no I mean lunk on the ripped on the end a little bit that's why I added the filter or a crutch so it's not hitting the bus let me see if I can fix it or do some but the ash is really white for being [ __ ] up with being a blonde this is a really good week the taste is [ __ ] fire especially in the blunt it makes it taste even way better it's [ __ ] like some exotic [ __ ] I don't know you guys send the picture I'll post it again right here let me read it because I don't even think I read the whole thing myself Blackwater og and the constraint typically bred from in dopers San Francisco Fiocchi because it's round compact but take a deep purple color sweet grape aroma never leave stress in his ID that's one of the things that seemed and that's [ __ ] I didn't know I didn't know about when I got this dream but hey that's just [ __ ] exactly what I needed I made the right choice this dream pretty much says like a little bit of everything a lot of benefits from it and that has a pretty good yield to anyone that won a cannabis cup so yeah this is some [ __ ] fire ass but you guys seem to closeups tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of it and if you guys were smoking along with this video tell me down below in the comments what you guys be smoking on and I don't know I just want to do more videos like this it's getting really dark someone end this soon I want to get closer with you guys like build like a more stronger relationship with you guys if you guys know what I mean so I've been going like live my Instagram a lot so if you guys don't go follow me on Instagram I'm Ronnie ray you guys already showed if you guys into the giveaways cuz I was one of the rules so um I don't know I'm just trying to like get really close to you guys I'm like build a bond then relationship sort of speak you know what I'm saying so I don't know if you guys [ __ ] with that and I don't know I gotta like that I got a lot of date things planned I'm [ __ ] spired I'm I'm motivated I'm obviously like fully into this [ __ ] I invested so much [ __ ] money and time already answered this [ __ ] so I'm fully dead like fully committed into it you know what I mean that's what I'm trying to say so expect some dope-ass content coming soon and if you have any suggestions for me just even down below in the comments but besides for that oh I was also thinking about getting my grandma her medical marijuana card

"OMxzXPCVQKE": "okay as always we've got four as to what we're doing free steel let's get it ready got it ready to go for as always you've got four points to cover on this strain smell no so I smell ya your toys face you do why do you want everybody together okay so I do one you do one yeah I don't want you do what I do want if anything we do if the effect sir hello welcome back to another episode of strain cane as my name is Rizla and this is a spoiler TV channel for stoners just let you don't be scared don't be afraid don't be shy you are okay guys it's okay to smoke weed and this is channel that loves you and hopefully you love me and if you do love me I'm gonna search straight away give me a thumbs up on this video this is a weed view it's a Wednesday which means it's weeds day so too much talk as always let's get on to the next strain of reviewing what are we reviewing today on weeds view well there's a story guys I've been saving my buds for this very special day and on today's episode we're gonna have to cover this one because I thought if you'd be in this situation before you've been saving a bud and you've put it in you've put off but actually knows what it was I put it on a tray I first was gonna pin a pot then I moved the pot and put it on this tray because I was using the popper saying else so then I put the draw on the train the thought the the bud on the tray and then I don't know how much just not realized and I've put that in a grinder and grinding it up didn't smoke it just grind it up and then I realized wait a minute what have I grinded up and I've grinded up the black dog oh gee also known as black do gee I think it's the same thing let me know if it isn't on the comment section if you know they are two different strains I fit they're the same string so black dog or black do gee he's getting reviewed and this is what's left of it guys I did rude mash up in the grind off do apologize but I think it's mochi though did I so that's something I'm smoked it and if you want to see what it looked like it's anyway looks like good job that I actually recorded the clothes socks before this [ __ ] off so yeah that is the read we're reviewing today have you smoked this drink before I'd love to know if you have if you've heard about the strain and you haven't smoked it but you really want to smoke it then put that in the comment section as well put everything in the comment section give me your phone number whack it in the comment section don't give me your phone number if you want to give me your phone number won't you give me your phone number you became mean everyone abused this video your phone number so do that at your own way your own a call to just do it and if you want to do it people phone you don't blame me blame yourself so too much talking there's always on the on the weed view auditions where we don't cut it out most of people don't cut it out really any time it does get cut out if the battery was to go and the batteries on about 30% right now and that's okay and another reason why we've cut it out is if someone phones me my phone is here somewhere so there was a chance of that probably will happen some probably does foamies you in a week view and it will cut out then if not should be just me blabbering away flagging my way through this review as I try and give you what my personal opinion is of this amazing strain which are always so amazing that I would say make amazing strain I just smoked amazing strength so this is an amazing strain they're all amazing and their own little way really very seldom do I come across the string that hasn't got some kind of unique amazing points of it this is not this is saying I was this green boys I'm making right now don't you smoke a spliff while I stop the show actually but hey it was already half smokes and I want to spray the rest of it so sue me so four points the cover as always on the weed view we are looking at the site the sounds silly again don't mean this why why why do you say the sound this comes it just comes out so easily sight sound we're looking at the sights the smell the smell of it not the sound the smell of it we're also looking at the tastes and of course that was important the effects I do give Hoffs and I have known to be quite generous with the scores so if you do disagree with me and then again comment section below slag me off tell me what you really think of this train if I'm screwed up too high or if I screw it up too long as well let me know as well so just finish this last bit of it we see not - what you smoking right now there's another question for you before we even covered the strain another question what you're smoking right now how you actually smoking the black do G can you smoke in a black dog so let's talk about the history of this and I always get my history from various websites such as Leafly so if you want to find out what I find out just going to leave things we do together me there's the phone call there's the cup [Music] sorry guys but yeah I knew there was going to be at least one phone call during the show and that was the one hopefully that only one of the show so that I've been done with let's get back to the black dog or the black do chief I haven't decided which we're going to call recently a black dog make it easier so let's go to the black G which we do get site no but the line is first song we and the PhD from this so it's coming up now anyway Shh but it looks like it's a cross of emerald heads - no yeah his head special or emerald headband no you'll find out cuz you'll be reading it and the other one was a Blackberry or a think blackberry maybe blueberry but it would make sense if as black bear with it so you'd be expecting some of the blackberry or blueberry to be in the taste of this and the the pictures the photo is coming up now guys again so you can see what we're looking at it was very very dark I'm looking at the grinded up leftovers now but it still looks very dark very very dark I mean I'm talking extremely dark I'm dark Browns dark greens and then they and again I'm not just saying this because it is called black dog but even so dark the greens that they do appear black and yeah okay I'm not just saying because old bloke in the title really it is got black in the buds in that dark I mean it's not black so dark green so dark that it's just you know you can't retell that it is a green it just doctors black or Satan that yes thank for you guys humans can pick up different variations of one color than more than any other color and that is green why if you know why I put in the comment section and if you don't I'll let you know at the very end of the video does it know maybe I'll watch the whole thing if I remember anyway try try and remind me during the video dry and remind me somehow if you're watching this live which you wouldn't maybe if you are somehow or you're a time traveler come on think let's do it let me know what we're talking about I have no idea what it's all about do you know what I talked about hopefully you do hopefully someone out there doesn't because if you do email me all right sites first we're gonna go site scoring at a 10 and as I said it looks amazing and it's half me to tell now but it wasn't that compact it ruin he's not coming back now is it the bug was in compared to some of your oh geez out there and some of your buds that you're getting not knowing near as some of the buds that I've got lined up for reviewing and ass I mean I'm gonna give it a very because I like the darkness of it very very just just layered with different colors of of dark Browns oranges greens just loads of them I'm gonna give it to give it a seven give it a seven half not as much frost coming from it you know could we see too much resin and I don't really you know don't really think is probably maybe the the best sample of the black dog oh gee but you can only review what's in front of you so yeah I'm gonna give it 7 for the look for the site up next not the sound oh no no no no no we're looking at distinct facts are what smells like I wish I could smoother but there but this it breaks it up nicely in a way so weird it smells a bit hazy it's a cush this must be hazing I think that's the finest in it very piney very just smells like you know if you're having a naked bath under a waterfall in a shower under waterfall and you know it just has hitting you mmm nature mother nature hit me mmm like that it's like fresh goodness outdoor mother nature us so it smells like we've Oh snows oily like like you know the oils that you got a bio oil and stuff I know just seeing the oils feel no like scars and stuff to do that the ex used to use boil off the scar here 26th birthday there's 20 ships birthday someone might trip me over and was bashing into each other like that in London and you know just bashing like that anyway he changed the whole rules of the game about and let me know when we're quite drunk to come back from my birthday and been on the piss all day and instead of just bashing into me he decides now to put his foot out and trips me over so I trip over and whack my chin first first thing to make contact to the hard floor of Westminster or yeah if it was West Minister's train station the hard are always metal floor that I what floor is marble floor straight onto my chin spit the whole thing open just blood coming it everywhere it took me about three hours to get home I was living in Greenwich at the time so maybe free maybe longer food four hours to get home and to go hospital straight after that and got the food stitched up yeah by your will and smoked quite a bit of it this the spin a bit vile oh really so yeah wailing it's a helicopter going past hopefully not after the Black Dog you know after me are you guys they found me [ __ ] how do they find me I'm really like in the snow this it's not so strong and you got that Oh genus in now there it but not as a G smelling as as again some other oh geez but I like snow you can tell a lot of smoke they keep smelling it I really like smell what I'm gonna give it a night I was gonna give it a seven half but I actually really do like this smell so much so it's got my nostrils yeah I'm gonna give you an eight for the smell now we come to good stuff halfway through the review and we are getting touch on the taste of it now one of my viewers did say you want to see me skinned up okay only you see me skinned up you can sort of see it yeah I'm gonna use a green bow now I've got some other Rizla the Kings but these are a bit thick bit fat I use them for this as it is my last split well I'm not bad to get half your spit out of it as well yes stiff enough so I'm going to edit out with these two small or medium sized ones with all monies fridge is actually maybe when I first start smoking it was all with our king-size buddy else all the time all the time there you go there's my own mini L really in it again kids please do not copy me I am stupid and don't recommend you use backing with your spliffs if you're gonna use spliffs that's all just use pure openings guys he says as he wax in sabaki okay he goes the dog grinded you up didn't I about two weeks ago now I'm finally putting you in the split but we got really confused black bug look what the hell's going on here you break me up and now lay me in the spliff what's going on there you go you're in it now I didn't make rubbish didn't I swear just made ropes I'll just just do that and do nothing with other so cover it up okay we're in about two thirds of the road to material because you're interested I do and it springs up the last they're looking at big thick Roach not too thick this biz you guys go easy cuts me off a but there you go you want to see you skiing up but how fast you were skiing up can you fast it skinned up quite fast under the circumstances if you was a like maybe

one of them let's take you side by side so I'm half right oh [ __ ] my life Oh hold on Tom she's been a while since it's done an L so there you go should have made me pay attention to which side was rich I swear I did but obviously not so but it's raw dition you want to see it guys quickly let's see much tile on the skin up process you've done tainting this long I don't usually [ __ ] up you might believe that now yeah one skin up guys if you haven't subscribed yet we are at this moment I'm on about 677 subscribers and we need more we need to go further we come up to the the 700 milestone

there you won't [ __ ] about now the right way here is the black dog let's find out what it tastes like it's in SUSE SUSE eun-suh's mestizos once these really really hardly ever sneeze single YZ always - almost always - have a good record of double sneezy there's a spliff in the mouth and it find out what it tastes like take that [ __ ] [ __ ] don't nobody move it tastes really nice did you know what when I was smoking this quite a bit when I first had it I had quite a few different oh geez with me and it wasn't tasting it was definitely one of the least frame for other oh geez that I had at the time and now I haven't smoked some oh gee I haven't smoked for quite a bit and I'm it smoking Herms and various how am i smoking but if you're Hayes's recently into them and some upper cookies but no GQ issues and I can really taste the edginess now what is what's going on with the taste of the new place dog the first bit you've got is that oh gee that really oh gee murky powdery darkness yeah you got that straight away but then it tastes in the taste changes but it doesn't change like a gradual taste it's like almost like a Shh stop and I'm getting dirt a dirt wall taste this is crazy oh gee stop dirt dirt like mud proper muddy Rudy dark I mean I I bring a taste like it what the name really is proper black taste dark taste some people hate this I think your og lovers out there would be confused with this people that like your flavors would find this disgusting it was a really small niche of a stoner I think that would really appreciate the taste in this and I'm I think I'm one of them I think I like it doesn't give me doesn't give my brain a time to a time to rest it's like straight on with sank else read really dark taste alas I'm gonna give it a night I mean I get the taste hey you again want I get anything enough but I'm gonna give it a night hold on I'm gonna give any yeah it's a really good score for this not your best tasting oh geez bass interesting so it's getting late for the taste of me the effects now I've been smoking loads of pazi's right now getting onto the OG getting onto the cookies giggling because I think this is a hybrid maybe you looking about again roughly your 70/30 dominant to the in decide indica site but don't hold me to that information will be popping up hopefully but the effects on this not much of a couch lock one you know like you can really glue or you know you know maybe you grind any purples and stuff like that maybe from the ones I've not reviewed manipulation big nuclear ago but yeah grand navy purple you know very relaxing well all-around hybrid really with the effects not a too strong I think it was between 16 and 20 percent and the THC I couldn't even smoking this exactly what the THC than if you could be if there's any stoner out there that could smoke a strange oh yeah that's 19 and a half th see the but I think it's quite strong but not your strongest but you saw what was about the strength visit really it's all about the other decides to it as well the textures are the smoke they mean you know what does it do to did you know is it is it making me well I see why the fat cake yeah a really bad bad cake I can tell you now no life I just forgot about it until I just remembered now to talk about it and not that bad not bad I swear it was hurting me when I first got any so help we don't know but effects I'm gonna give the effects on this can you give me a late as well another eight or now so I think we gave it seven and a half I hey Annie I don't Bri know what the score is I'd always forget what the scores are the scores are coming up as you can see right here there's this course hopefully I'm putting at the right direction don't appoint them that way let it be embarrassing when it could be the scores are here wouldn't make sense as it led to Spacey I mean nobody want the scores on me and Chucky Chucky Chucky talks yes oh yeah that's Chucky this is Rizla this was Black Dog oh gee thank you so much for watching the we view where I just talk bollocks because it is the raw editions if you didn't enjoy Kimia thumbs down but hopefully you gonna give me thumbs up and as I

she wants you to stop to distrain Keener's see you later on Rizla is she's drinking as always we've got four points to cover on this review system it's gonna be the sight smell the taste and the effects smoke cigarettes smoke cigars [Music]", "jbimzAkUofQ": "[Music] welcome back to another Bammer TV weed reviews today's strain is going to be the much-anticipated cheese strain and just a reminder for you guys if you want to check out some of our other weed reviews go and check out that we'd review playlist link will be in the description but let's get started with today's strain cheese so cheese has been named for its sour sharp aroma and it was a first cross bred in the UK in the late 80s now it has excellent trichome production and is known for increasingly better yields every year and you will definitely know when you have this strain due to like the Dave was saying the signature odor on it there are some other iterations of cheese this is probably the most common that you're gonna find and it's actually one of my favorites it does smoke up really well as you can see here we've chosen a bong as the method just because like we said this just smokes up so much you can see here that a gram of cheese just fills a bowl so this is great if you guys want to do multiple packs and we have a big group of friends this is definitely the strain the sharing is caring with this one most that feeling that from an effects point of view it does help you stay very relaxed and happy and it even has a tendency to make you giggle a little bit like a little schoolgirl so go figure on that one medicinally it's great for pain management and it helps with depression and stress as well yeah and this is just a great weed to bring out if you guys are at a party or get-together definitely brings people a lot closer cheese weed though it kind of goes through you know patches where it is uncommon and then it is common so if you see it you're probably gonna see a lot of it Dave I got to ask you the burning question pun intended aha if you were to give cheese a Bama rating where would this fall on the scale I really like this string I need to I think it I think it hits all the marks for me for top of the line store the one that we had did have a little bit lacking in the flavor Department even though the smell was really really good so even though I really like this train and I want to give it a little bit of a higher rating I'm going to give it a four and a quarter out of five for an order that sounds fair enough and like we said before bong is probably the preferred method this is great bull weed as well just because like we said before it grinds up a ton so you can just have you know sesh after sesh Dave anything any final thoughts on this string I really enjoyed this train as you can see in the video it's very crystal Eve Airy Harry and it looks very unique and that's what I like most about it it's very unique Snow unique look and I think if you see this out in the wild I definitely it's worth at least a quarter of your time that's what I think yeah I mean cheese you can't go wrong with any of the cheese strains so thank you guys very much for watching like I said before if you want to check out some other reviews we do have a we'd review playlist and that will be in the description but for everything else weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "K_5pN_hffHY": "[Music] what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is yay 1 and in today's video you'll be trying another completely newest strain absolutely stoked to give it a go from what I've smelt and seen so far this strain is [ __ ] amazing I'm yet to smoke it I literally just chopped it up and prepared a set for the video so I'm gonna be trying it first time on camera with you all and obviously sharing some close-ups and what we think of the strains so as you can all tell by the title we're going to be trying some key lime pie strain today she likes of course from Brian from GM GP delivery services for gifting this flower so we are able to give this a shot today literally it just cleaned ate the dubuque here so we're clean and ready to go on a fresh new and clean it you all know how we roll we're gonna sink one here get into some concepts from the tripod and then obviously ya have one more to end the video so hope you're all smoking alarm hope you all have an excellent [ __ ] a day let's get into the first rip of the key lime pie well that's amazing very very very nice I do like that as I said I have not tried the key line before see many people in the community smoking on it and growing it and obviously seen it in many dispensaries and delivery services but I usually stick to what I know gelatos feel scared cookies sunset sherbet any type of like push strains like og cush anything that I've smoked before that I know it's really nice that I know I will like and well obviously purchase before you know getting something that I'm unsure of Herot more smoke and taste and hit so kind of leave myself in a little bit of a box as it is to like it's good to mix it up with strains every now and then obviously as you all know it can we can get quite immune to smoking at the same strain you know say after about a week or so it's always good to try something new and mix it up and I'm glad that I'm able to bring this to you all today so now [ __ ] babbling tripod is up and ready to go let's get some close-ups of these Nicks and then get one more hit to the [ __ ] dome before we start out this video so the key lime pie strain is an indica leaning hybrids the phenotype of the Girl Scout cookie strain testing a de debate 26 percent THC this strain will leave you feeling relaxed happy euphoric and up lift it tastes of this strain will include hints of pepper sweet undertones and hints of gelato like I said in my personal opinion whence breaking up this bird I could smell sort of a sunset sherbet or a gelato sort of smell from this strength but first initial smell was very peppery so saying there 26 percent THC this is a strain definitely for all you heavy indica lovers I can say that I smoked a couple of cones of this after recording this video and I must say that is it is incredibly strong and highly recommend it to all of you stillness now let's get back into a a second hit and wrap up the video so as you can see from them close-ups off the keyline pot absolutely amazing medicine the undisturbed trichomes in all their [ __ ] glory really really frosty buzz the yeah it's very very weird as I said in their concepts their the the smell first off it's almost like a very peppery strain like something you would find in the herb cabinet that you would be cooking with well then as you know you break up the bird and as I was chopping up the medicine it did get much more of like sort of a sweet sort of dessert smell almost like the gelato or the sunset shimmer which was quite weird so first initial smell very peppery but then drifting off into something very sweet I'm gonna take one more hit with you all like I said if you do enjoy these strain reviews smash the [ __ ] out of that like button let us know if you've tried the key lime pie strain before in the past and what you personally think of it other than that let's get into this last [ __ ] talk Cheers now I will say for all of you heavy hitters eight there I love your indica strains testing out there about 26% probably my third or fourth cone of the day and I am smashed who definitely did the job so check it out appear in the area GM GP delivery services or if you see it on your local menu or dispensary give it a shot other than that if you can't cope don't mock theories hope smoke dope I'll see you all in the next one you [ __ ] bunch of stoners he said everybody [Music]", "8hlUTTP2IwM": "what's up everybody it's the good Easter back once again with another strand review let's not waste no time

show hey you welcome to my push review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with orange push pop kush string so we're going to do a nice review of the orange push pop string so if you've seen my videos before you know that i've done orange crush that was pretty good i mean it had a nice orange taste to it but i found it kind of had like a strong like kind of orange peel taste but it did taste all right so this one has like a really strong orange smell to it just like that one did but it doesn't have like kind of like the peel has like a bit of a smell this one don't really have that smell to it so it smells really nice and strong like a really orange citrus smell to it though it does smell really strong really nice too so check these buds out it does look very nice it's a nice light colored green and it looks to have like a lot of crystal on it looks very nice so let's light this nice joint up and review the taste as well [Music] so it does have like a really strong orange taste to it but it is a nice actually really nice sweet taste it tastes very nice like the orange crush i found kind of had like a bit of the sweet but sour taste to it that's what i was trying to explain like the peel taste but this one is just like really sweet [Music] i don't really taste much sourness to this one but it is a very strong flavor it is really sweet so let's take another look at the buds and the account and see how good account this came in this was 2 grams so it does look like it is a really good account nice packed hard buds they look very good it was a little pricey i paid 35 i think for three of this one but it is really good tasting and really good account seems like it's worth it because if you throw that extra couple dollars in usually it is worth it sometimes you don't really get that good of a deal whatever when you expect it when you buy the expensive stuff but usually it is pretty freaking good if you pay that extra a couple dollars but this one i'll tell you right now i'll give it a at least a four to a four and a half out of five for flavor because it is a nice strong taste it tastes very good and the account looks very nice too even the buds themselves they do seem like they were well taken care of like trimmed really nice [Music] it is overall good strain i'm liking it so fat [Music] so what i'm going to do next i'm going to be coming at you with captain american og shatter so keep your eyes open that and i got cookies and cream strain and sour taggy too those are going to be coming up soon plus i got a few more but i'm not going to keep going on what's coming up soon just keep an eye out i got lots of good stuff coming up so [Music] like i said for flavor i'll give it like a four to four and a half at least because it is a very very good flavor i do enjoy it's nice tastes really nice like [Music] and it's really high thc i'm pretty sure it's like at least 25 to 30 percent thc it is a really strong strain and it does taste very good so i definitely recommend it i'll give the account rating i'll give it about a four as well it was pricey like i said but it came in a nice account i got this nice join out of it and there's still a nice few buds to roll a couple nice ones so i'll give it at least a four for a count as well because it is pretty good [Music] so overall i think i'll give the orange push pop an overall rating of four to four and a half because it is a really good strain i'd definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out i say do so if you like more of a sweet strength try the orange push pop if you like a bit of the sour kind that is sweet too but not as sweet just a bit of sour try that orange crush because that was a pretty good strain too but i didn't care too much for the sour i mean i do like the sour strains but a little mixture was a little different for me but i do recommend both for different people like depends on what you enjoy but they are very nice buds i'll hold it up again for you to take a little better look this is the biggest one that came with them they're all nice buds but this is the biggest one it came with um four nice size buds like that that's what i i took about the size of this one to roll this joint with so it was a really really good account [Music] and buds are really really nice so like i said definitely recommend it and i want to take a quick second to say thank you all for coming and spending time watching my videos i appreciate everybody that comes out here spends time over here with juveniles does i really do i hope you all are doing good and having a good time in your own lives have some good [ __ ] to smoke [Music] until the next one y'all have a good day peace [Music] now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have

quits oh gee that's a blue dream cross with OG Kush cross with 398 bubba kush some of the three hottest strains in the last 30 years under this one uh quits oh gee I guess that's named after some Native American shaman I don't know don't know too much about the story there it is three legendary strains in this potent hybrid from the San Juan eco Mountains easy grower great effect so that's gonna be the blue dream crossed with OG Kush and then they cross that hybrid with the pre 98 level Kush just pick this up dark heart nursery shoutout to dark heart I love their stuff I've seen them a couple of times use their stuff once before great results great genetics huh it's March 31st 2020 we got a little cough the one I guess I got to Cove it I don't know I'm just joking how do not think I have go ahead so there's a second cut we got two of these that's quits then we picked up some gorilla blue classic banger from the 2017 ugly males the Cannabis Cup winner 2017 if I'm not mistaken who wrong fact check me and we got some pineapple upside-down cake I'm stoked on this cut I'm probably going to cut this and hold onto it for a while this is just kind of one of those new trends the cakes that I'm looking forward to supposed to be pretty sativa heavy dominant with the pineapple I think a trainwreck influence so I love trainwreck I'm really looking forward to the pineapple upside-down cake that's gonna be rad and then I got two strawberry bananas right here strawberry banana so this is another kind of sativa heavy hybrid supposed to be a little bit shorter of a tree so this one is in a bigger pot it's supposed to not grow as big so it's be stubby and short which I guess you can kind of tell already has that trait I mean look at that short and bushy and almost look at this team of trained Arachna toria's for stretching right it's a wreck to train his wife's train wreck this just gonna stretch forever pretty much throughout the entire flower so here we go I got a 4x4 Grove California everything's legal I got the frame of a scrog set out because if I'm growing I'm doing a strong little path down the middle and access each plant boom boom boom boom boom and this is about

high-pressure sodium and one motor health metal halide I'm pretty old-school a girl in soil I've been doing this you know 15 years at least so I just go for myself too I don't I don't push any of it probably through a lot of money down the drain not pushing it but you know what to quit supposed to be one of the hardest cuts right now it's supposed to smoke like Panama red I don't know never had Panama red that's an old school cut that's from like 69 1970 man is how oldest genetics is coming from and I guess only has had that this whole time and you know he's now starting to to branch out with it that blows my mind somebody's had the same genetics since 98 3 98 bubble cush that blows my mind you know on this also give some that blue dream we'll give it some bigger denser nugs to so

break all this down and smoke joints of it so it's very very good indoor but it's just not up to my par that goes into my bong it's definitely beautiful it's priced accordingly it's priced at $100 for seven grams so 50 bucks 1/8 that's usually out the door and everything even better news is when you can catch this flower that's on happy hour or you know leave a positive review on weed maps for the shop or even refer a friend next time you come in ask for a discount asking if there's anything you could do ask him for the happy hour for these shops that we can afford to get this medicine I know it's pricey not this one in particular this is priced very reasonable these are baller jars so it comes in a big old jar like this big old jar size my damn hand what's a quarter 7 grams got the gold cap Kings garden so it's $100 a quarter and if you get it on happy hour or special or whatever it's even cheaper so it's lovely to have rolled up smoke like this so this is in between my all my crazy biscottis and alien labs and burner and piggies and all that this is what I smoked in between [Music] lovely smell lovely smoke all the crystals very unique smelling garlic mushrooms and onions GMO cookies I think it's at 30% or some [ __ ] let's see what these [ __ ] members say GMO cookies 30.7% total cannabis 38 man I don't even know what the hell this [ __ ] is but yeah usually if you see

my forehead that was first hit now what okay let's get this light turned on a little bit again i don't want too much light on me got too many shadows there okay all right sorry you guys have a little difficulty with the lighting this morning we got it now this is about my favorite most favorite time of the year you guys it's not too hot anymore you can start breaking out your jackets and [ __ ] start breaking out my boots i can get my timberlands out now well that's all pretty much all i put on my feet anyways temps different variations though but now i get to break out the old school boot once you know what i mean you know what i mean wow you guys this is really delicious i am in hog heaven over here jesus take the wheel that is some kind of delicious there's that diesel taste all right sheesh nice little mellow i've been sitting on this bud since the first day that i did my first exotic from cali i've been sitting on this since then so you guys know how hard it is for me to sit on la confidential woo is so lovely and tasty and delicious i love belly confidential i think everybody has that one bud that just [ __ ] gets some highest highest gas before i ran into a la confidential it was like i think it was like sour diesel and stuff that used to get me high super high but um [ __ ] like i said everybody has that one bud to get some hot what's the buzz that gets you the highest like i don't care what nobody says somebody might even say this some [ __ ] but but then you smoking you highs gas that's something i don't like about it continuously burns but i guess you just gotta cover that is that wind the fall there's like a slight slight lemony flavor behind that i've never really tasted that in la confidential but there's a slight lemony flavor behind it for the most part it's like a sweet diesel taste i love that diesel tasting weed man for some reason diesel taste and weed goes together perfectly even when you smell that [ __ ] when you open it up it smells like gas in that bit tell y'all it's the most beautiful thing oh yeah yeah but that's about all the flavors i taste on it if you've never tried l.a confidential give that [ __ ] a shot whoa whoo so you guys know what was it day before yesterday i was all hungover and drunk and all shrooms and all that [ __ ] tell me why last night left you bring a bottle over i'm like you know after you had a hangover man you don't want to drink for at least three four five six maybe another week give me the shot bro took two shots and was like okay that's the other thing about having a hangover if you have some of the hair of the dog that [ __ ] you if you drink what you drink the night before don't drink like trying to get [ __ ] up just take a couple shots and it'll bring you right back to where he was level but actually it's best not to drink period but i cut out everything else so i got to have some party time somewhere no i don't this my party tom i need to stop drinking but i never believed in that a a or n a [ __ ] none of that [ __ ] works man it's just a [ __ ] plot because the only thing that works is you if you want to quit what you're doing you can quit what you're doing let's pack this balls again it burns up kind of fast if you want to quit what you're doing you can quit what you're doing the only way you quit anyway is by going to that place if you get court ordered to go to a [ __ ] drug class man nine times out of ten you're not gonna quit there's a few people that learn but nine times out of ten you ain't gonna quit cause you don't wanna quit you're being forced to quit see if you wanna stop doing something man you have to first of all want to do that [ __ ] i don't need nobody to help me help me alone and not doing this [ __ ] anymore and that that [ __ ] they always say man once an addict always addict that's [ __ ] [ __ ] if it's once an addict always an addict why the [ __ ] am i going to aaa or anything if i'm always going to be an addict there's no need to [ __ ] with y'all then what i need y'all for sure just let me be in my addiction and [ __ ] y'all you should never tell people that you're always going to be what you are the biggest room in the world is room for improvement don't ever let anybody tell you something tell you something that you know that you ain't don't nobody know you like you i don't give a [ __ ] who you is on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] 10 being that awesome [ __ ] of the flavor critique of this la confidential you guys already know i got to try not to be biased about this because me personally i would give it tens all the way around simply because of what it is but the flavor critique it's not a complex flavor it's just like a sweet diesely taste with a lemon aftertaste it's really not complex um i have to give it a 8. only on the merit of what it is as well normally a regular flavor i probably would have gave it a seven this particular strand right here all la confidentials are not the same all strains of what you get is not the same they are not the same there's levels to this [ __ ] you guys so um i'm getting pretty baked those right behind my eyes though this uh oh right now but i still feel so sexy tasty and delicious this does make me feel sexy though i'm afraid to touch myself y'all stop it that's some funny [ __ ] man y'all comments is awesome man

for a while to do this one it's so delicious i feel like donald trump not hugging the flag like an idiot he was like up i don't want to start nothing political if you're for donald trump then [ __ ] you i mean before donald trump that's good for you i'm just playing you guys personally it doesn't matter it doesn't matter who you who you vote for it doesn't matter who you believe in our votes do not matter they don't matter at all if anybody tells you our votes matter that's some [ __ ] i don't know what their agenda is of having everybody come out and vote there's got to be some type of hidden agenda about it because our votes don't matter donald trump being president shows this we had this discussion before so let's not get into politics let's keep it light sorry about that you guys on a different note i haven't been hearing too much about corona bars i think corona bars be taking vacations but you guys pay attention and you heard it here first and i hope that i'm wrong so i heard months ago like when summer first started that they're not actually going to release the uh pandemic or release the uh virus until uh until uh uh fall until the fall that's what i heard so let's see it was from a credible source of what i assume to be a credible source most people on tv ain't credible anyway especially newscasters gosh you guys i'm getting really high this is nice you know what this high makes me feel like a head knocker remember the cannabis that i gave a 10 out of 10 that's what it reminds me of it is delicious you can't get past that flavor man yeah man i feel pretty oh so pretty i'll see how cindy i was just like i'm too happy to be smoking this i've been sitting on this [ __ ] for a minute y'all every day you sit right in front of my tv too every day i look at i watch her on tv there's la competition talking about smoke me smoke me [ __ ] out of here oh you finna get smoked a little guy don't worry about it i'm gonna smoke this [ __ ] out too i don't know it'll be time to weather strip my [ __ ] my patio i see the only thing about weather stripping the patio is we got [ __ ] cigarette smokers here man and these [ __ ] like to smoke cigarettes in here that's the only problem with it that's a nice breeze if i had some hair y'all see it doing this [ __ ] right now [ __ ] outta here yes [ __ ] y'all oh would i recommend this to my friends you already know what i'm saying most definitely i would recommend this to all my friends in fact i recommend this to y'all and this this was i'll see on the bottom it was 5 grams of it you know five grams no more but it smell so delicious man oh my god you guys i am it seems like i'm getting higher and higher like like usually within 14 months of the video i'm not like as high as i'm going to be this feels like i'm as high as i'm going to be like but you know we got to go at least at least 17 minutes man so i could get a good critique on the high you know the high should settle in by 17 and 20 minutes that's a non-professional uh thing there i don't know how long it takes to settle in i assume it takes different people a different length of time to settle in that was a long [ __ ] conversation i was trying to end this i guess oh y'all you can tell it burns kind of quickly because this is the third bowl and i knew this was gonna happen because it's really confidential it's not that i'm not high it's that it's so good you ever had weed that was so delicious man that you just couldn't stop smoking it you just kept smoking it and smoking and smoking yeah that's that's what i'm doing here because i'm already high i'm sufficiently baked but it's only confidential what do you expect [ __ ] outta here cause i'm gangsta salute cheers didn't work you know i kind of feel like i'm coughing less because i'm not using ice so shout out to homeboy to tell me about the ice man can't remember your name right now man but um i really appreciate it big dog thank you because uh yeah that [ __ ] that can cause bronchitis or at least that's what the what the internet says because you know you gotta kind of take everything with a grain of salt but that grain of salt was necessary for me to take you know the difference between right and wrong your body you was created to know the difference between right and wrong your body automatically knows it so if you go with your first thought when somebody says something to you or if you see a homeless person man i've driven by a million homeless people man but there's always just like one or two people that just stand out it's like i got to give them some money skirt here i've backed all the way up down the road before i flip the [ __ ] u-turn and pulled up on a dude and gave him 20 bucks here man just because that's i know that it was the right thing to do i don't know how i knew but something's like you have to do it so when you get that feeling about certain things man you know the difference i forgot where i was going with that but i ended quite quite swell i did land on my feet i love a parade look at my hand you can still see it all right there that whole circle right there there you can see it better right here the whole part but like i said man i could bend it to this point now i can almost touch my pinky here remember before i've only been like this far now it's like this far i got an appointment to go to the hospital friday on an unrelated uh on an unrelated thing but i'm pretty sure they're going to say something to me then if they if if i go to the hospital friday and they tell me friday oh yeah let me check your hand out is broke i'm gonna be like you [ __ ] man why you guys wait a whole [ __ ] almost two weeks to call me to tell me to let me know my [ __ ] was broke you guys could have told me that [ __ ] like the day that y'all got the um the x-ray oh we just wanted to re-break it for you i don't know if i want it re-broke now as long as that swelling goes down man i don't see any problems with it just because i can't lift the heart in this i don't need to lift my pinky and heart of that i don't drink like this all the damn time f wrong with you and that was a nice hit all right okay [Music] on a scale of one or two one being that [ __ ] 10 being that was [ __ ] of the high critique of this la confidential it's a pretty nice high now the hype the high is a little more complex than the the flavor so we're going to give the uh the high is going to be a 9. it's going to be a nod because like i told you guys this this l.a confidential always just grabs me by the nuts and like let's go bruh so uh so delicious to me anyway like i keep saying if you're new to the channel smash that subscribe button hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of these fire ass videos i hope you guys enjoyed the video and on that note it's time for me to bounce out oh today is better than yesterday and i hope tomorrow shines them all you guys have a blessed legendary day and may you acquire everything that you need in life who you guys already know saying you ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the hell out here stay big", "R49uG4c0IbQ": "[Music] yo what's up guys stop line toker back here again and welcome to another video guys in today's video I got 36% yeah that's right guys we're going be trying out some GMO so before we get started with today's video yo make sure to let me know what you get y'all are smoking on down in the comments section below and also let me know if you guys are watching inside or outside of the united states let me know all down in the comment section below so a little backstory on this I just got this today if you guys haven't seen my Instagram story I posted it to in 36% GMO I never purchased anything that was 36% THC it's going to be epic it's going to be cool I can't wait for the [ __ ] hi it's a it's going to be a powerful [ __ ] indica uh I've been trying to get my hands on on some real GMO I would probably say like almost a year ago I thought I got GMO but come to find out it was like a really shitty term of it but I got this bad boy I can't even say the price so hope you guys haven't seen already I'll throw up the email up on screen YouTube took down one of my videos which is kind of [ __ ] it's only a warning but I'm I really got to be careful with what I say in these videos because obviously they're out to get me and they're out to get any other cannabis creator on this platform it's really [ __ ] that it gets really [ __ ] sad now they're literally trying to get rid of content creators we're just smoking weed there's [ __ ] out there smoking the message like bust those [ __ ] weed is legal in California sorry for that little rant let's try this GMO I got a bowl loaded up like I said let me know what you guys are smoking on Cheers let's get Lydia like a titty and let's try this out cheers y'all I had a pretty good taste to it Harlan I don't have to describe that won't get the taste and stuff in a little later down in the video so this is 36% GMO straight-up I was so [ __ ] stove and it's a half an ounce so like I said y'all this is just a chillax sit back type of such video where I'm going to try out some 36 percent THC and just let you guys know what I think about it and to kind of show you guys how it affects me or how it will affect me but so far I kind of feel the buzz coming on it's kind of like in my head like I can feel it kind of tingling behind my eyes so this is just going to be a sit back getting [ __ ] up video I was supposed to post a string review video for today but I'm moving that till next week I ended up getting this today's the 20th so I'm recording this like a little over like a week out or under a week out but cheers off let's take another longer let's get ready I'm going to do a smell test and kind of describe the smell and we'll look at the buds and stuff so Cheers [Music] [Music] you know what I kind of get is uh so you guys know when you like lunch on a onion but you had like a like it cooked or grilled onion in like a burger or something and you kind of know like the aftertaste that's kind of a little bit of the taste I'm kidding it's fine like after like it's kind of hard to explain because I found really getting stoned super [ __ ] quick like I'm not even like joking getting super [ __ ] stuff but yeah so the company is calling Claiborne coke bust out [Music] Clayborne coat yep premium but yet sleep late manic in truck play Claybourne coat PMO 36% that's like you know like I'm looking at the bottle and stuff I'll have like a little video playing you know but uh there we go all right but smell it I'm gonna tell you guys what I think about the smell we'll take another long rip and just kind of let the high kick in a little bit more after I talk about the smell we'll take another long rip maybe two and then I'll get my pole like reveal on the high [Music] so when the guy so at the BP that I went to so you guys haven't been to your legal fully legal DP because of the whole Ovid cop cop virus [ __ ] you cannot grab or touch bottles they have to hold it up and they have to hold the bottle if they have any and this this load that I've been going to hasn't like let me do like touch or smell anything anyhow the dude described the smell to me he's like imagine um onion soup like garlic and onion soup and I was like okay I'll get as like a it smells like garlic and onions like if you had him in like a group bag and you like have them cut up like cut like like a hot cut of onion and a half cut of garlic you put in the bag it's kind of a get after smell that's like the best way that I can describe it I know it's kind of where like yeah like the [ __ ] like how did you come up with that but that's how I got the best way that I can describe it for you guys on camera so I have no idea what the two strings are that make up like what the strains aren't that make up GMO I'm probably just going to call this video trying to 36 percent THC our 36% GMO so let's take another bummer we'll talk about the high Cheers [Music] [Music] ooh I'm not doing my that ripped off [Music] yeah y'all um yeah I have to tap out up to that hit I'm really getting stoned so so far right now it's because it's kind of like kicking in it's kind of like a slow creeper high like I'm not going line so it's all up like it's kind of like a head high right now but I can feel like my legs kind of tingling feeling that like kicking in my legs and stuff you know what I mean but uh but yeah I guess how I will see how I am like an hour to later down the line but so far it's kind of like a slow mover and I can kind of tell that it's going [ __ ] rekt me in the next like 20 minutes to half hour so I think I'm going to end it here y'all so if you guys have just [ __ ] I [ __ ] that up I'm not even going to edit it out because you know what I [ __ ] up all the time so if you guys have had it's kicking it I'm trying to end it super quick alright if you guys have tried GML before let me know what your comments what your opinions are down below let me know what the percentages are the GMO that you've got I've never seen

bar and brought awareness to it to the public that you know that there is something better out there I would say that maybe 75 to 80 percent of the strains out there today and spawned off of the cam dog 91 a lot of other strains out there have become dog in it nowadays it was one of the first you know it's like the pioneer of the beginning of the of the whole movement of time but Norman I started to smoke and read in 1989 88 so in Massachusetts it wasn't it was kind of hard to find her there wasn't like you know a lot of it was just a brick leach it back you know hi guys this is Kevin dog um I was a guy that started the 1991 chem dog seed and well first you gotta spell it the right way if you want to talk its do Gigi I don't know where everybody gets his da weg from my cringe and I see that okay I grew up you know a normal kid and raced motorcycles dirt bikes normal you know I started smoking pot and I really like pop I always would scout out try to go find a good bag of you know went to the dead a few times and when I would go to the dead I would go search around for dinner but a lot and you would find it there because everybody was from different states and all got together and everybody brought their goods there obviously these guys walked by and said time but kind but nice okay cool and I smoked this and it was it was the most craziest tasting but I've ever smoked very skunky sweet pungent 'if you li like you know like almost like sour OG camel and one it was a craziest flavor I've ever smoked the first one I met him they said some people call it dog but some people call it can weed because what they think to this day was sourced out from Northern California Southern Oregon till Thursday we don't know where it came from thank God exchanged phone numbers we kept in touch in August they had gotten in some announce of the cabin dog 91 sent to me I had found 13 seats so I decided to start him I I didn't start all my started four of them one was the camp a b c and d one was a male I threw out I wish I had that male to this day when I started you know growing the bud and giving it to people I'd go to dead shows and people would come with scouting for him you come running at me but I had to actually limit input because people would I want it off I want it off I was working as an intern at wetlands and you know he ran up to me it was like check this [ __ ] out and he pulled out that was the first time I'd ever seen the chem 91 pretty soon I was calling him like you know every week trying to get as much chem dog as possible 2010 2009 is when the height kind of started it was very underground till then before that it was always on forums and people just started to realize you know some of the best or but they never smoked you know chem dog is more famous now than back in the 90s because you were more underground back in the nineties you weren't out and about you weren't on social media there was cam dog is more famous now than it ever has been within the last three four years I feel I'm glad I preserved it and you know and still to this day the original clone cup of the 1991 is still all around I can go out anywhere around here no one even knows who the hell I am really I'm just normal person and I love that I don't care about the fame you know I have a family I have a life I have kids you know hash tag family first as far as I'm concerned I'm glad I did what I did because you know there'd be no chem dog no Sour Diesel straight up there'd be no cam dog and no Sour Diesel fight about that see it's like the pioneer of the beginning of the of the whole movement of kind bug movement [Music]", "fNIESLj60OQ": "hello Florida medical marijuana patients this is Florida medical marijuana reviews again here with a true flower from true leave this strain is white Buffalo it is sativa dominant with a whopping total 26 percent THC now that is the highest percentage of THC that I've walked out of a dispensary with but again still paying the highest amount for an eighth that I've ever paid for which is 53 dollars an eighth again just like the Girl Scout cookies it is another expensive strain it's it's very dense it is so dark that it almost has notes of purple when it's ground up you can kind of see the backs of little leaves giving off some vibe of a light purplish but it is very dark it's coated and trichomes it has like a musty almost animalistic smell I'm assuming might be where the Buffalo name came from because this might have smelled like a wet Buffalo walking by me when it was ground up I almost got a sour and peppery aroma as crazy as it it's it was like spicy it almost had like a food scent to it this white Buffalo actually helped me sleep like medically speaking it was a benefit to my sleep habits to have this the other night and even this morning having done awaken big session with it I feel like I could go right back to sleep if I needed to and get more sleep like I could have woken up at 6 o'clock this morning had a bowl and then gone back to sleep till 8 or 9 and comfortably woken up you know it's also known as sativa that I feel like has affected me mentally like my mind's not racing I'm not getting an anxious rush I'm I'm mentally clear I feel great I can tackle my problems I can go on with my day I feel cool calm and collected it's a it's a great feeling to be medicating with this White Buffalo I've truly enjoyed it as a sativa this is one that I will come back to I traditionally like to stick to indicas but this is something that I feel like has almost an indica vibe to it lief Lee's gonna sit there and tell you it's an 8020 dominant sativa but that's the problem with the whole concept is that everyone truly needs to try each strain for themselves and oh my god I just realized what we're gonna be watching during this part of the video in this is my fiance's Freudian slip here with the videographer I'm so sorry that this is so phallic of an image here that you guys are looking at but it is a beautiful shot we had to put it in I couldn't pass it up I mean look at that that's almost purple there on the right next to that little hole look at those trichomes it's beautiful oh and this is where we we do a little vape Bowl here and show you guys how I use my da Vinci IQ this is what I like to call investing my medical marijuana I'd like to keep all the vaped bud that I have in a jar and I use that to bake with readily I have a whole fire cracker recipe I plan on doing a video on for you guys and showing you how to use all that vaped bud that you can keep by using a little personal hand vaporizer like this you could use a tabletop vaporizer however you want to vaporize and activate the THC to become THC a and then makes it into some fatty substances and eat and I will do a whole how-to on that it'll be hopefully easy to comprehend we'll see how it goes this is just me emptying out my vape to show you guys the vape Bowl what it looks like at the end and then I eventually put it in a little jar to stash for when I'm ready to bake and make awesome edibles but thanks for watching this is a Florida medical marijuana reviews again with white Buffalo from true leave at fifty three dollars an eight this sativa dominant strain is truly one to keep around I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope you guys enjoyed the video", "ajBEa3tjB8k": "what's up y'all it's your boy Sheldon with another fire ass episode of wake-and-bake 8:00 this morning we have a new strain for you and this frame is called za za za za za za za r indicate a unique Larry Bird's a lot of number for phyno that's all it says on it I'm not gonna show you the bag that it's in because this is just a filler bag in the company that we came from is um dere designer in rare exotics and if you've got seen this before but what's in this bag is called za za so this is one of those bags another one else bag that I don't stand behind as far as the name goes but that's just a company name on there all it is let's see we got here here we go we had busted it open already looks pretty good look at all the colors zaza ok I hope you guys slept like kings and queens last night cuz you know how I sleep every night I slept like a king last night so I don't know if you guys have heard the warning but there was a warning that um white supremacy or white nationalists or whatever they are KKK are gonna be going around killing people of color doing a 4th of July weekend so all I'm saying is you guys just please be saved ok yeah all I can say you guys please be safe this weekend man I know if you guys want to do far worse like everybody does they're gonna do far worse would upset me about this is that if the um if the white supremists are coming on and telling everybody that excuse me I'll hang on a second ok y'all I'm back I'm sorry I had a little dilemma you guys see me just before I cut the video I kept looking down well it was like a line of ants over here anyway what I was saying is that how come the government doesn't say any white nationalists or white supremists or KKK member that's in the ass or caught killing any person of color will be will have a severe fine and get life in prison you know give them something stupid like I've done a hundred thousand dollar fine and life in prison you know so if you tell them that then he'll be like well [ __ ] maybe we should go out killing people anyway they say beware of people that have um hoodies on or people that are wearing coats like it's out of place is summertime and people are wearing coats and hoodies watch out for those people watch out for people to leave packages anywhere you know I'm saying like if somebody walks up walks up beside you and they put a duffel bag down and they walk away leave Leave don't try and stay away from trash cans trash receptacles all that [ __ ] because the white supremacist have been caught putting bb's and nails inside of a bomb in a trash can so when it blows out you know beanies and nails for everybody people are just inherently evil like I say inherently because they inherited that [ __ ] anyway that's getting on this only zaza it smell it doesn't smell like anything different it smells like like a piney lemony earthy smell I've had saws out before but I'm not even gonna tell you this is dispensary great or not because it's not in the proper packaging so I'm not gonna as far as I know it's free great smells like it smells like dispensary great and looks like the Spence was great but I can't give it dispensary great because I didn't get it from the dispensary no other person I know he didn't get from the dispensary so oh I got my icing it just felt didn't feel like it was a half like there's enough water and I couldn't talk for a minute brother cause you need to smoke [Music] damn Zaza when I smoke somebody's yesterday ready to smooth out this bag smooth around my party's back but I smoke you out of my ball there was none of these flavors the definitely taste of citrus but the stitches that I tasted is lemon yes there definitely lemony back taste tasty though alright let me go we're straight in good to go somebody sounds like it was really mad in the comments other day a new bills yesterday before but it was like God you sound like my brother man take smaller hits oh my how is this true done you so much when you smoke weed do you make sure that you don't call I don't know that's enough we're talking about that [ __ ] we're talking about that do the whole time I've been going man it's like I'm probably about 180 videos in so right around around the 10th video everybody start saying Jerry man you call the live site you know so I think he's time to put that to bed we're gonna talk about coughing anymore I'm gonna talk about I'm tryna talk about coughing anymore I'm not gonna say the lines we'll try not in here we go whoo-hoo severly Creasy that a slight burn on the top back of my throat the buzz is kicking in but this is supposed to be an indica - it's feeling about right it's right behind my eyes it feels like a creeper I like still getting it if you're new to the channel welcome to the channel

prison tell a friend to tell a friends and someone and someone y'all know what I'm getting at so I guess y'all we see that the highest kicking in now huh cuz I started getting a little more animated I get a little more knit feels good it burns pretty quick though so this is a fast burning but even though wait a minute when I'm taking about four five hits off and this supposed to be a one-hitter little snapper so yeah this is a bum right but I've had bowls that lasted longer wait longer it is so we could to pack to bowl which all today haha someone crease it up boy so let's go oh why it's a lot to live in there it's really tasty oh the high I hope the high didn't just stop right here because if it did then I'm gonna be fairly upset Beauregard let's get back in here and see what's going on with this so we didn't completely pack the ball this time so you guys know it's a little off the top so I'm inspecting about four five heads off this let's see oh damn fan yes [Music] I'll be hitting on Finn I said that I wasn't gonna smoke it he took my birthday which is an October but I couldn't resist it because I have ran out of weed was it yesterday every day before I ran out of weed I had no meat I had no personal head I couldn't go to the shop and get any it was just it was ugly so I was like wait a minute I got some resin over here a bomb smoking on that [ __ ] that [ __ ] it's like you guys are smoked regular weed you know you're high you feel good you know but when you smoking sadiq y'all know it's a whole different story this is all a whole ball of exotic man probably about seven grams now so when you smoke that you get an exotic high it's like it's smoking weed job you don't mean you smoke when you get that that funky taste in your mouth that oily taste in your mouth and integers it just tastes like burnt up weed that you look that you smoking not this [ __ ] this [ __ ] tastes like like I need to start selling it I'm just playing how's that for a smaller hit was that better so I don't know we're not gonna talk about it y'all thought I was gonna say it huh okay well scale one to ten one being a [ __ ] ten being a good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of this Zaza we're going to give it a its average flavor excuse me but because of the name because of its origins we're gonna give it a six normally I would give it a five because of its averageness or because it's average I'm searching to see if I need to give it a higher number but six is perfect for it flavor of six um this particular strain of Zaza my friends would expect more than that so I guess I wouldn't recommend it to my friends it is a pretty good height I am pretty high but for the regular novice yeah this is a perfect strength you know for youngsters this is perfect man maybe for some older people tell you to because all the people don't like super strong wheat because they don't want to call that much you know I'm saying but from my era if you don't coffee you don't get off I said we're gonna talk about that no more son Shh let go it's gonna be hard to stop talking about that I can see it already it's really nice now the bus the bus is kicking in it's kicking in stronger it's longer who you scrum it's um you know I guess I would recommend it to my friends if I had to recommend a street grade marijuana or a street book the street grade cannabis to you I would recommend sounds out to you now there wasn't but there is a strand of zaza that I'm pretty sure it's dispensary great and my homeboy is like ma'am he hit it and immediately put it in the glass they break this in case of emergency anything like that [ __ ] is too good oh my gosh I got some of that but this is all right this is my first time smoking Zaza well first I'm smoking it for you guys I smoked a little bit yesterday like I said yes it is my first time actually smoke oh why did I do that oh snap okay woo wow that just increased he just doubled my wow this is the first time I'm now keep smacking my lips y'all but I catch myself doing that a lot but that's because like I told you now if you ever get the swallows like you take a fan hit you start coughing - you mean sir son swallowing we call it the swallows yeah that's what I'm doing that [ __ ] that's what I'm trying not to throw up on my mouth that has gotten so watery from that last hit and I'm trying to get the flavor of it so excuse me for the lip smacking it's not because these [ __ ] is big I'm just play up yeah shut up way that was tasty and so delicious you know I'm really concerned about about this weekend coming up man because you know this is a threat that you have to take seriously it's almost like what female tells you like hey I got eight you're not gonna mess with her even if she goes you know what I'm joking I'm just playing I don't have age I don't care you said that you have a after that I just stopped listening after that I won't leave it here you know I'm not the type of person oh you got age and run away I'm still gonna talk to you at a distance because they really don't know all about this [ __ ] anyway so oh I'm getting high y'all because I lost my train of thought oh that was good a good loss of train of thoughts it's gonna come back well even if you don't I don't give a damn cuz oh wow it's really surprising me because it's like even though it's a slow-ass in it's a skinny-ass in I'm getting hot as gashel it's right behind the eyes yeah boy right behind me down lies your let's get back in here I feeling so smooth now y'all I feel like I walk down the beach with my favorite my favorite now I was looking at this bag you know I wasn't even gonna show you guys this bag but it seems to be a cosmic bank but if I had to call fake bag on anything I would call it on this now if I hadn't seen homeboy put the [ __ ] in here from a big bag I'd probably be like man that is what the hell that is but I've never had it so it's from the designer and rare exotics dare the day of secret society I don't know nothing about that I don't know nothing about them what I do know is what we're into it the contents of it is solid our baby's ours are melty and I'm so damn hot yes or is it going already on y'all damn y'all we get three up this morning stop playing man ain't nobody smoking three bowls in the morning like that what you tell us you're burning quick on Salamis I don't really like quick burn a tweet man I don't care how good is I don't care if it's the best wheat under the Sun I don't need you burning quick I want you to stick around for a little while don't leave so fast down smooth extremely smooth anyway on a scale of one to ten one being [ __ ] that you do not want Tim be an issue that you look for of the high critique of this on that it will show you the bag of the high critique of this zaza we're going to give it a I have to give this an eight for the high definitely an eight in a high eight in fact this is really a good high now this is what would make me recommend it to my friends is this high it's a nice mellow cool high it's not - what's the word I'm looking for I can't think of the word but it's not too much you know I'm saying it's not like you're like extremely high you're just like whoa man I bet you have you ever been that high - you're just like yeah my dude they don't been that high one time we thought box the car I think I told you guys this story before anyway my boy stole some weed from somebody this wood before they even started legalizing weed weeds in California he rolled up this big-ass blunt this hot new day stolen some money blood bought this long blood bout this well two of them sons of [ __ ] we did the car roll the windows up start smoking it's for Bob of us in there there's five boys I think it's three peeling back two in the front we're smoking passing around these big-ass dudes I've never had a smoked out car like this in my life you literally could not see inside the car this is out smoking the car we're gonna sit around there chilling my boy they lead winners up so we smoked the whole book telling stories laughing giggling shouting little schoolgirls in the door let's rap [ __ ] he finishes the blunts and she puts the bullets out ain't nobody roll no running out for coughing spitting none of that [ __ ] William stayed up so we stayed there for about maybe about 10 minutes I'm just taking big deep breaths with all this smoke bills in the car and then so I starts to come and start pulling on my homeboys and all right wait wait a minute wait a minute we get up to about 45 50 miles and I says all right everybody well he runs down we roll the windows down the smoke crunches out so Eric broke brushes it and I don't know what that combination did but Jesus took the wheel and it stopped the car and I asked anybody that's the first time that I could not drive while hi I pulled over and I never let anybody drive my car and as I said can anybody else drive and everybody's like see what the [ __ ] this [ __ ] ain't funny can any one of y'all [ __ ] drive [ __ ] make up so why couldn't even I couldn't function I couldn't even contemplate an inkling of a thought it was just I never been that high in my freakin life even when I smoke this [ __ ] they used to call low boy y'all remember and [ __ ] shirts take some place they call it water what is it um embalming fluid

smoking some very heavy sativa once again and he brought a special treat to us today this is a special treat funny you say that this is Dutch wine a combo of Dutch treat you know wine sativa now this is a classic - yeah this is a classic and this is known for its super uplifting high but to me personally it's known as the weed the the half pound that got taken from me in a chick-fil-a drive-thru by sometime and the worst part about that is I don't even eat chicken so it's like man actually [ __ ] was you doing there man my homie he's like y'all we gotta check out chick-fil-a one just opened up like we don't haven't run you and I'm like oh I see okay all right dude I'll take it and then [ __ ] they're contracting traffic and [ __ ] they pulled us over and those those cops those Casas they were trying to get the weed and finally they're like all we want is the weed and I'm like all right yo I got we got this weed lighting so the end those cops they took it and they open it up know like mmm I'm thinking why in tonight just like what the [ __ ] yo and those cops man look I'm saying things slanderous yeah that's a story I'm glad you were able to get some more it kind of yeah it's reminiscent of that but at least uh yeah this is bomb weed like I'm gonna tell you right now I was breaking it down stickiest [ __ ] had that [ __ ] really tropical sweetness to it I grew up a wine in to come back in the day and this reminds me of that this is [ __ ] super good classic OG or oh gee classic like it's pungent sweetness like yes it has a very earthiness to it but it also has that tropical sweetness I kind of got a menthol like - and - when I was Brittany I know I kind of smell like menthol taste yeah yeah no it's a smells just super fruity superb it's got a little bit of everything honestly so it's not really in my wheelhouse but you know doing straight tasters we we know what good weed is if even if it's not an indica that don't mean I don't think it's not good weed yeah this is [ __ ] fire and you got this from Zips yeah I got this one zips of pretty crazy zips every Friday 30% off so that is a canvas store that specializes and selling houses yeah this was [ __ ] how much do you this work I got this for one hundred and forty dollars one hundred and forty dollars [ __ ] ridiculously cheap and I can I'm not a person that is like if you tell me you know I've got this ounce 440 I'm gonna think it smooth most of the time because like I'd be paying top dollar for younger yes this is [ __ ] good ass weed right here for 140 yo I'm gonna say that right now oh yeah and I've never smoked this before never tried this before I only went to zips one time to get some high tide weed when I heard that it was there but this like I was blown away when I seen this and how much you paid for you and it's cool - yep - it comes in a pint glass yeah I got a tennis ball lid on it and it's kind of got me wanting to like I think that maybe I'm hoping there's just like a little flower design I'm hoping like maybe the other strains have have different designs so you can like start to collect the shitty because that's - Andrew mystified in my mind right now yeah yeah no it's definitely assembly that like energetic sativa like Hawaiian sativa I mean that's just that's just one of the pure like a sativa godfathers you know crazy that it takes like the Hawaiian and the kids me that's just like that's the Hawaiian flavor and that's probably why oh yeah so that's dope and Dutch treat - is a classic like that's always been one of my favorites yeah like back in the day before like you know things were to where they are now as far as like genetics and gas enos Dutch treat was like my god you know yeah these are little Dutch treat just classic quick in West Coast og tonight yeah no it's just it's definitely like a like an OG powerhouse you got these like pure og strains man kasi bro yeah [ __ ] with it so like this is your strain you've been smoking this for a while and years this is my first time trying the Dutch wine but uh where would you put this where would you wear would you rate this man the highest atiba factor makes with just how like fat these nugs are I know that the Hawaiian sativas famous for its fat like banana shake nugs and I can totally I see that these similar you look price was like let me give it two fingers for the price yeah I mean honestly with all those all those things put into play man I gotta give this I got to give this a like a solid like nine point by I'd say it's just it's just so solid maybe nine point six I mean like I could smoke a bowl of this and then like you know I'm off I'm ready to go you know I'm working on beats I'm you know I'm just I'm ready to do [ __ ] for the price and for everything that you

name is Cheyenne I am a supervisor at cinder in Spokane Valley and today I am going to trying some pineapple chunks from Virginia company these guys are aeroponic very clean facility one of my favorite things about them is that like they said on here clean controlled and consistent I haven't had anything from Virginia company that I don't like so pretty excited about this smell is definitely one of the first things that I look for this one has a little bit of a kind of sweet almost citrusy almost citrusy kind of smell to it it's not super overpowering but it's definitely there by nice dense bud which I always look for dense but especially when it's an indica don't want it to be super flaky or like crumble apart and my fingers but want to be able to break it up by hand which this one so it's definitely a good mug so oh yeah there's some super frosty teal good job Virginia Company pineapple chunk this is supposed to be a pretty heavy indica to yourself we'll see what happens here this one's so much lighter in color than most other indicas sounds like a really light green all right my fingers are super coated and sticky [Music] Wow [Music] as very good as a very light kind of flavor to it kind of sweet but not like not like a berry sweet or like a fruity it's [Music] yeah a little bit little tiny tiny tiny bit about that citrus there definitely a couple of I feel like this is like almost kind of like a uplifting like definitely more of a lighter indicus feel than I was expecting I was expecting this to be a little bit more heavy so knee high but I actually feel kind of like energized a little bit this one is testing at twenty nine point seventeen percent well it's pretty decent I give it like a nine eight or a nine out of ten for flavor really like the way that the buds feel and it smoked really nice and definitely have a good buzz off this guy say nine nine four flavors ten for looks and appearance and overall I give it yeah a nine nose like that [Music]", "sKcyBi2-hEk": "we're recording now hi today's review is going to be ASMR I'm just kidding this is the loudest [ __ ] review we're gonna do whoo marijuana reviewing that's what we be doing so today's weed is some of the loudest weed you can get in the legal market right now today we're looking at black market cherry punch this is coming in at where is it now I can't remember this is coming in that twenty eight point eight nine percent THC here it is right here twenty eight point eight nine percent THC that is the strongest cannabis in the legal market to date if I'm wrong correct me but I've never seen anything over 26 so getting twenty eight point eight nine practically 29 that's good to see I'm excited for this one yeah my friends at spirit leaf West Kelowna let me know that this black market cherry punch just rolled in and said you got to come and get it we heard it strong as [ __ ] I'm gonna see what it's all about cherry punch is a hybrid they took ak-47 and crossed it with purple punch to give this a nice well-balanced hybrid super pump let's just get into a purple punch has a very purpley color that's what I should be expecting here something purple you know let's just [ __ ] see let's look at the package a real quick cuz they all want to know what pack state is May 16th and we're are June like I don't know a 3 June 8th so we are three weeks old not you bad that's some of the freshest [ __ ] on the market right now three weeks old so I got this stuff as the best I could get it in its best form that it's possible to come in here this little jar 52:19 for 1/8 of cherry punch glass container big fan glass container I'm also wearing my nice shirt today I put the nice shirt on for some premium craft dope-smoking straight up let's get in here got the handy-dandy scale crack that [ __ ] open that is pungent pungent is all I can say right off the start it's kind of ripping through my nostrils if you will all right okay there you have it it's three point five three point four seven that's where we're settling at that's bang on you know a couple hundreds off you can't judge anybody on that that is a three point five eighths good we're there all right here it is so super caked it's Trico me it's got a very good keyer sponginess to it that is right for smoking beautiful weed though beautiful look on that marijuana the other purple punch I've had in the past has been much more purple but that's different phenotypes that's how it is all right there's the eight focus that's looking pretty good that's looking pretty good I'm gonna take this top nug right here I'm gonna put that in the grinder with this other piece right there oh here we go twenty eight point eight nine percent THC that [ __ ] excites me that was a little rhyme it's very pungent usually when dealing with a higher THC strange we're also getting more terpene profiles out of that which makes those strains more pungent little more like smash in the face don't be a little bit's and smoke meek I'm strong that's what it's saying Rolie Polie Olie here we go I'm [ __ ] hungry to you right now whoa smoke super earthy right now I don't have too much to say about this coming into it right now there's not a whole lot of ripping flavor it is just [ __ ] heavy and that cough that I got right now that's a good cloth that's what I want I'm smoking some dank weed but as far as taste goes it's not fruity it's not florally it smokes like an earthy but robustness to it it's very pungent when it gets in your mouth it's saying hey man I'm [ __ ] here and i'm not air-eye thick ass smoke that's gonna bug up your brain today I'm definitely gonna smoke the entire thing I'm definitely gonna smoke the rest of the eight so for 52:19 in the legal market for twenty almost twenty nine percent THC you gotta go and check it out this is that dank dank stop this is the stuff that you show up to a friend's house with and be like yo I got some heavy ass weed and they're like yeah right you got some heavy ass weed that legal market don't produce no heavy ass weed and you're like well now they do because black market just came out with some dank ass heavy we flavor profiles coming out now getting a little further in get nose oils building up and making that whole flavor smokey nice but man it's just so heavy no I like my tongue is tired all right let's do this oh oh man black market cherry punch strongest weed out there twenty eight point eight nine percent THC made weight three point five graph also glass container I like that well I like that I could reuse this upon opening there is a floor Lee knows there was a purpley punch knows that's for the smoke it is heavy it is dank earthy finish it all the way through the ash is beautiful look at the ass there it is again white freakin ass that's what you want a smooth clean smoke of cherry punch something that's been in the black market for quite some time we all know about it we all smoked it but to be able to get this in the legal market nobody has anything else like it nobody else has anything as strong as it right now so definitely highly recommended for $52 you know that's what it is and that's a pretty fair price for some [ __ ] that you can't get anywhere in this legal market we're still gonna work on the price but it's 52 bucks this weed is getting into the eight point ones big fan of this weed I'm gonna smoke the rest of it I'm gonna put myself to sleep eight point one [ __ ] yeah black market did it again [Applause] [Music] I'm your neighbourhood Weed Man but you like that [ __ ]

try to get into like but i want to talk about tonight is GMO we I didn't my first day yeah I'm in my car yeah but I didn't want to just first say for those smugly because a lot of people that would let us say we all smoke we just because you know I like to or you know because it's one of my favorite hobbies or whatever but do you really smoke we just for that purpose alone or for those purposes alone or do you smoke weed sahaja okay and what you're going through I just want to say like for those people who do smoke we be careful at the way that you smoking it's probably a whole bunch of people right now that smoking GMO we and that's whatever and that's what I want to talk about right now genetically modify we got that I realize it's like this we is a trap real talk this is a with this this type of wheat is a trap for your inner self it keeps you at a very very very very low point and when I say low point I mean look like yo it keeps you at a very very low vibration very low vibration you know people are type 2 you know they give them these names you know the artists cushion all this loud but also genetically modified that's genetically modified we bro not only it is the weed that's are smoking it's mine awesome if I don't know what that mean please look it up his mom altering we this weed effects not only it affects your moves but not only your most of the fictional consciousness and that's what being yourself so you if you smoking genetically modified we you will never and when I say never really wouldn't he will never reach your highest potential people try to say all alleged smoke we just because I like it not didn't want to say weight is not weight is not addictive bro I was going to tell you right now what is it is addictive is as a addictive than any other type of weed any other than any other type of drug I'm saying school said that Manny's hell booked they don't be telling you the truth how does the Mercedes have I been pre-registered to smoke we yes it's a visiting a whole bunch of songs heck I haven't been stereotyped maybe because I got the locks I don't know but I'm telling you these is the lead that y'all smoking is not real we is not naturally I don't even smoke and I'm only 20 his people but it's people way younger than me you know going down the line 19 19 17 16 15 even 14 smoking weed they don't even know what they smoking it's for telling y'all it's a tough as preventing you from reaching your highest potential in life and inside because equation the crazy thing is they ain't gonna tell it they ain't gonna tell y'all none it is that's gonna say all is natural some of the weight is natural this GMO wheat is not natural my bad y'all back to what I was talking about about the genetic we might have thought we be a lot of this weed they want to say that is natural that's what they want to tell you but a lot of this weed is not real we'd ever be smoking with our home he's brought us that's not real weed you know I wonder why let me let me ask let me tell you this how do you feel how do you how do you truly feel before you smoke that blunt aren't you on a moody move feel like you want to punch somebody but then after you smoke that joint or that weed or whatever you feel as if you can float or something right but then as soon as that huh come back behind you back to you back to you no back back in my mood she was there maybe pudding maybe testing this weed on y'all this artist is I'd be putting all this type of messing y'all weed that's the reason why y'all feel that's what you wanted I feel a certain way if you don't have it it's not real weed at this hole that's how I just hope more people will wake up today I need to wake up is we did it this way that child smoking is not real it's not and I always wonder why it was just like I I never I never had that that type of energy to be like okay let me get that or you know you know past the blown away I never had that type of energy and obviously that was the reason why my conscience was telling me not to smoke that again this demo we do plays a big part in your conscience if you smoke in this type of we yo your conscience will not rise up is all and go go down your energy yo vibration is only gonna go down you're making yourself into a hole that you I mean that is that is gonna get hard to get out of by smoking this type of weed this weed

guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I have 1/8 of white Buffalo from true leave in Panama City Beach Florida let's check out the THC it's twenty two point nine percent THC with 1.1 percent cmeg and 0.2 percent THC V for a total of twenty four point two percent cannabinoids that's not bad at all check out that seal like I'm so want to do it's a good seal on there Oh looks like we got some decent or at least a decent bud in there see what it smells like oh wow interesting it smells very sweet it has a very almost cherie sweet smell on top of maybe lime or maybe a limey Sour Diesel kind of flavor take a look at these bad boys so I just opened up man that smells good I just opened up an eighth of Girl Scout cookies that was all oh man it was all minis and look at this this is not all minis check that out that is beautiful it's got a nice purple to the calyxes it is well coded and trichomes there are some less dense spots but overall it's a nice thick coating of trichomes it's not up there with like the pictures of the Mac one I've seen I know if you guys have heard of that the Mac one that one plant brought out that is ridiculous this isn't quite on that level and it doesn't have that same price either so let's see white Buffalo is a sativa dominant hybrid strain it's a cross between la Romulan blackberry Kush Bay 11 interesting I've heard lots of good stuff about it there's supposed to be a pretty powerful and euphoric sativa so I'm excited to try it out let's go ahead and weigh this up and see how much we got sounds like a little doggie boys having dreams over there giving us little buff Wolf's alright silly boy alright Oh 4.1 I did it guys I did it I got a four point one oh my gosh I went over four grams this is like winning the lottery I hope you guys can see that right there go ahead and zoom in pause it 4.1 bingo so wow that's pretty cool I actually did it so hmm this is normally fifty three dollars for this eight and I had ten percent off discount because of my truly points so it came out of 47 seventy so forty-seven seventy-four 4.1 grams might actually be a decent deal once you do the math I'll have to see but if you can get 20% off with by stacking with a sale or if you could stack with your own truly points twice like they sometimes let you do then you get it down to 40 to 40 which makes this a pretty dang good deal if this is how you get it now I just open gross Scout cookies at 3.5 grams so there is definitely a possibility that you don't get it now I do like to see the decent size bugs instead of you know the little small stuff we've been seeing lots of but let's get some close-ups of it alright let's bring it in for some close-ups here check it out a nice covering of trichomes on these things heck yeah it's really good this is definitely the level of coding that you need to have if you're gonna be charging this much and not like those Girl Scout cookies tiny tiny mini nugs that had my last review going even closer still and you just look at it looks really good just covered man still not quite on the level of the Mac one trichomes is because that was just ridiculous like you look at those pictures and you could barely even see anything under the trichomes but this stuff is really good too there we go it's definitely got a ton of trichomes on it very nice some shots from the back see how it looks over here all right I think it's time for me to vape some of this stuff up before I vape it I'm gonna break one of these open okay that these are very dense super dense kind of like the star killer berry dance buds oh it has that burnt rubber to it when you open it up you break it apart um it does seem dry not super dry it does seem a little dry all right I'm gonna get all chopped up get the vape loaded and see how it is I want to taste the flavor on us it's got a very interesting aroma to it and you know I really like these strains where you break them open and you get a strong pungent aroma out of it I've had a lot of unfortunate strains it seems like where there's just not much smell to him and I was actually surprised that the Girl Scout cookies was like that I've heard so many good things about it just didn't really have that much of a smell to it to me this it's almost all chopped up that looks like a good amount get this pack these away doesn't need to be packed tight but just firmly enough so that it won't fall out everywhere man that was very pungent flavor to it when I inhaled it into the bowl get this preheated hopefully we're gonna get some big ole hits hopefully I won't Koff my lungs out on the table hopefully really um nice punchy piercing aroma like up at the top of my nose top of my I don't know what inside of there and yeah it's got kind of like maybe a little bit of a lime flavor to it and the sweetness is still there too it's really interesting they're trying to think there's a little bit of another flavor come out and I can't quite name it that's what I'm trying to think of here maybe a little bit of that Sour Diesel kind of flavor Oh oh man look at that okay Wow that's kind of intense all right I got that camera adjusted a little bit man these are some nice hits off of this really impressive you guys know any other direct draw of apes like this that give huge clouds but you don't have to hold down the button on them these cool give those a try that's our orany nice hit off of that one still getting vapor off of it and it's now really man it's almost got a berry flavor to it the the vapor coming out through my nose it's pretty yummy it's very sweet it's a nice vape for sure definitely a pleasant you know change from the unexcited aroma of the Girl Scout cookies for me see how this is soon yes I got plenty of vapor in there and it should I mean you guys saw the trichomes all over that stuff there we go oh my goodness oh man I think that's one of the most ridiculous baby hits I've ever had Wow dang the amount of vapor you can get off of this white Buffalo is ridiculous this makes me want to find some white buffalo minis for reals I'm gonna put this back I will not be eating it that is for sure that's for dang sure I will not be needing it man this is really crazy this is so so strong very nice the interesting part is is how strong it is without being like a heavy body feeling to it like that good for during the day if you need to get stuff done it was feels way stronger than the Girl Scout cookie you did and I took two big fat bong hits off of that this I mean look at how small this bowl is in the vape man this is good stuff this White Buffalo seek it out it's so strong my face feels amazing oh I got to blow my nose guys man this is one of those strings that makes me afraid to try for big hits because of how big they are holy cow I think your mom is strain honey man those clouds are just so big and thick give it another try another decent one not like those two big ones I had but especially not like that last one ah I can't wait to see those on film okay I can't wait to see those on screen because man they seemed so huge like I can barely I barely had my eyes open the whole time be when I was coughing because the hell intense it was I mean it was just like hold it hold it nope it's coming out it's coming back dang very effective stuff and you know it's not that kind of like you know tired groggy feeling which I like I really like it so both below the hype is real I think it is I mean I was probably more excited for Girl Scout cookies that's such a pipe strain you know like I mean that's that's one of those strains that's like been around and everybody wants it and white buffalo I've heard good things about it but man I'm surprised I it's that's way more my favorite out of these two at least from the batches that I got still getting decent hits off of it even though look it's just such a small bowl this stuff is great it's all those trichomes you can see on it this kind of feels like weed mixed with coffee already like you don't even need the coffee still getting hits off that little thing I'm gonna have to do a comparison where I find I could put some of this nice nice stuff that's got a lot of trichomes on it next to something that doesn't and show you the difference and how much vapor I make can make a huge difference yeah these are some dense notes dense very dense nose very dense smell nice nice effects really nice effects if you are looking for one of those clean sativas this is it right here I have to say I'm not happy with the price on them 53 dollars I will probably never buy these again I'll probably only buy if it's a concentrate or like I might buy rosin of this on sale and I might buy the minis of this if they have minis of it but I'm not gonna pay 53 for dang the effects are so good you know I wouldn't give this a hard pass like I did on the Girl Scout cookies because these are actual tiny little things in here you do get some decent buds and they're covered pretty nicely so this one I'd actually say is kind of justified you know I mean I think it's too expensive still but 4770 with 10% off I mean that's the price of Chee relief and then 20% off if you can stack that that's 42 bucks for it and if it's 4.1 grams you're paying like what $11 a gram I a little math and if you get minis of this you're only paying seven so you know really wait for the minis I mean and that goes even lower for the minis too if you're if you get the minis on sale which you know if you're getting these on sale you get the minis on sale so it's even better deal so yeah it's a really nice babe super super nice strain this feeling right here is is really great it's unique it's really nice a little bit on the expensive side though thank you very much for watching guys I hope you have a good", "E484Wa-8P_0": "what up YouTube welcome back welcome back today we got some papaya cake for you guys we want a true leaf I'm real excited for this one real

don't be stingy y'all peace out", "Ux1I3kIqspQ": "[Music] what is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm gonna be talking about this kind of restrain in front of me this is skittles with a Z at the start and at the ends and we're gonna talk about it in a bit of detail right here on the ice smoker Channel let's talk about the background of the skills cannabis train this is a really popular one for gem family and Terk hogs all involved with the creation of this strain it combines Grape Ape with grapefruit to mix those flavor profiles and it really does deliver a unique strong delicious sweet and fruity flavor the tagline for skittles is taste the rainbow and you get that with a flavor of the skills bud but also with the appearance as it's growing if it gets cold just before flowering it develops these nice purples it's just super popular from what I can see looking online doesn't it like you can get the seeds or the feminized seeds so clone only virgin family gifting Terp hogs one of the cuts of skills and the legend was born all right so I know there's gonna be a lot of searches for skittle so this is probably going to be quite a popular strain review I'll refer you to my research sources in the description in a video but it's places like wiki leave seed finder and several other sources just to try and get a background of this strain this particular batch of the skittles is some of the best I've come across this is organically grown in living soil using the no-till method of growing big up to Roadrunner really really nice skills this and I'm looking forward to covering it in more detail let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain so we've got the skit was here let's ever look at it I like the brand in I like that skittles sticker there taste the strain bro opening up the glass jar to look at the skills contained within yeah well not as many colors on the but as I was expecting actually I've got our flower from this grower that has plenty of purples and plenty of different colors on the bud this is more of a single green color right it's got the green sort of loosely stacked calyx a lighter color Asian dusty Huai comes the pistols are visible for troodon from flower as well let's get another nug out and just to see what the rest of them are looking like what singular colors you know so when I was reading about it was talking about how it it's got all these different colors but I would say that that isn't showing in this bit of flower nice trim job the buds been presented well I'm impressed with a look I wouldn't say it's as complex looking as some of the other strains I wouldn't say that it is jumping out at me as wowza this deserves its complete reputation based on look a low but well presented organically grown sort of buds got their own unique structure and shape it looks good but how does it smell I like to open a jar and just get a whiff of that gr smell and this is where the true skittles flavor really starts to come through the aroma is so identifiably skittles that you can just tell as soon as that hit my nostrils and that is what gives it its distinguished ability amongst the other leading strains out there you can smell it and know what you're smelling where is love a stranger might be like oh it could be this could be this this is skittles and you're gonna know their skills when you smell it what does that smell Intel it is a mixed sweet fruitiness that combines the grapefruit and the grape together it kind of comes across like a sweet sour citrus kind of combo which starts in the aroma as like a bag of sweets but then as you inhale deeply you start to get the citrus notes like creeping in it's a real pleasure to to smell this one so really really nice smell guys ten out of ten in terms of the smell I've smelt a fair bit of Skittles this is some of the nicest smelling skills that I've tried I could literally just stand like this for an hour just smelling this and just enjoying the sensation wowza one hour later excellent excellent expression of the skills of Roma in this grow we're gonna break this up and just see what smells are released inside here we go Oh exactly the same but with a wolf that comes from pungency that wasn't as available before so you're still getting the sweet you're still getting a mixture of those fruity flavors it's got an American smell like a Cali inspired sort of smell to it but it's very kind of natural and pungent that kind of skunk enos just coming through right at the end as you do a deep inhalation let's move on to the taste section of the review I've got my bong here we're gonna smoke some bombs of the skittles and see how it treats us I should also get a vaporizer we rounding up some of this skills to enjoy I have been smoking this really a while so I've tried it in every consumption method I really like it through the bong I really like it in a joint as well it's a nice smoking to join the skills this section of the video is all about that flavor if you are joining me for this one get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs really de briques heated up we're about to smoke and vape some of the skills cannabis strain but my vaporizers are heating up so that is going to give us a brilliant idea of that vaping flavor in the meantime let's smoke our bowl of the skills and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] I was so smooth and light I didn't even do the ball [Music] Wow what did come through was that it was flavor and actually I reckon it is down to the method of growing that organic no-till method of growing delivers such a nice smooth smoke and a strong flavor profile and this is one of the nicest sort of no-till grows that I think I've tried to they really enjoyed that flavor no need to cough no sort of acridity by in the chest just tasted them really really nice we're gonna do another one in a minute first of all we're gonna try the mighty vaporizer let's get an idea of how it bakes really skills e on the exhale or still now like the roof of my tongue is getting this skills flavor coming through like super strong super super strong [Music] that is in my top five will vapor straight away straight away Wow again I've got shout out the no-till method of growing Wow's our paint so top marks for flavor as well let's talk about the effects of the skills skittles is an indica dominant strain it's a hybrid obviously you've got a sativa of the grapefruit in there as well but it's listed as an indica dominant strain it doesn't mean it just sits you down and relaxes you straight away now first it brings you up and you get an almost sort of creative Drive something you could literally clean the house with but this doesn't last a long time if you don't catch it and start being active in those first few minutes as you start to experience the higher then the next stage settles in and it will take away that drive because it is a relaxation it's a heaviness it's a suit ly to that afternoon and even in tire smoke and it's something that actually for me is very very strong but also makes you feel a little bit chatty and a little bit sort of lifted as well how am I feeling right now it's time to kick in nice and fast I mean the vapors got a really high absorption rate clocks in between 15 and 23 percent THC there's not as strong of those super strong ones but I said it isn't everything sometimes it's the mixture the cannabinoids the terpenoids the flavonoids everything feels really really strong despite it sitting around the sort of 20 ish percent mark and yeah on the indica side but feel nice in the mind as where you know is that the hybrids do they combine the good effects on both ends of the spectrum I can feel the waves kicking in I've only had one bong and a vape of it and it is in odd I can feel a lot of tightness in my like around my eyes I kind of like headband but more around my eyes let's sum things up today I've been enjoying the skills cannabis Train organic no-till big up road run up we're about to smoke another bong of it right here on a channel join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] taste me it really comes fruit and I'm really late the flavor of that appearance-wise it looks nice maybe didn't bring out the Purple's because the stable temperature is a nice looking bit flower smell wise fantastic 10 out of 10 it's a really really nice smell it's like sweet notes there's like sour notes you know it's really complex flavor-wise the smell carries right through into the flavor vaping it is absolutely fantastic smoking it tastes great as well when it's a really smooth smoking experience I put a lot of that down to how well this particular batch has been grown and effects wise it's a lovely heavy stone for that afternoon even in time something that I will be enjoying when I'm sitting down playing video games or watching something on Netflix for example and yeah I'll write it very highly that is gonna be it for the skittles strain review on the I smoke channel I know

part of a lemon the lemon peel when you uh it's a column shredded right having a shredded cheese yeah that's right look it is not holy crap look out like Christmas see it looks beautiful why Christmasy it looks like a freaking little tree all right a little one and let's throw it in the ground there see what it's like I'm excited to try it I hope my review doesn't make you upset it because I have a different taste than you do the thing is we have different body chemistry's and I might not like what you like so take that into consideration listening to this review I had told somebody at a dispensary that I thought some weed was trash and I might have not used the right words to describe it and it wasn't good weed to me personally but I shouldn't have called it trash I hurt someone's feelings but I just I explained to them the body chemistry thing and will you believe we were on good terms all right let's give this a try all right oh man I don't have a lighter well I got one from truly happy Pride Month everybody I'm just talking for some reason but that was amazingly smooth waiting for that alright the onset starting to come on it's like a little bit of a warm feeling come on coming up in my head maybe I'm just a warm good you be warm but I don't seem to be doing anything to me try one more baller which you guys know me I like to know if it's good from the first bond with I don't like going for the second one second one means I'm wasting me I should already feel medicated from this one and maybe it's a creeper we'll see but remember tune we'll find out how much fun flavor not much of a flavor profile at all tastes like a cloud a warm cloud no flavor oh I can't even describe that cardboard water huh flavorless just like smoke not even that like a smoky flavor interesting I don't like it it's doing nothing for me maybe if it starts creeping up on me but you know I've already had a second bomb in up in them I really don't feel like doing a third one it's smooth and nice but like it's a waste that's just my little perception like I maybe it's waking me up no I don't think so I'm just awake generally it's doing nothing for me all right that's my review it's not really doing much for me oh it's good for flavor and not flavor it's good for just smoking for nothing you know it's not good what am I saying I don't like it all right buddy",

this loskutov juice a nice indica dominant hybrid see what it we're just like definitely got some a little nice frosty lugs there too bad guys are pretty nice they're real nice little ground-up pieces in there really pretty it smells fantastic going here cover this stuff no one to get dry good thing go a nice little silicone bong here always handy can't break it which is always nice see how this stuff it's bad boy smokes [Music] the nice feels smooth not too dry so or something uh look out for don't mind me on the copper yellow water always gotta have the water hand so you know it's good now this is really nice though got a good taste so far I'm gonna have the numbers on your skipper you see you see - and that's 21% tester there so he's nice it's good sweet spot right there never lose too many terpenes are around that spot so it's got a nice kind of sweet smell to it little skunky but not too bad very classic very smooth I love the color on it's very light green something I really like very easy to grind up but it wasn't too dry the taste was fantastic he a little bit of that sweetness on your way in it wasn't too harsh despite the fact that I copped out every single hit but that's just me bringing is something like we're doing a couple you're getting some good taste here with some good terpene profiles good smell it's an overall enjoyable smoke you got to love what your smokes not fun to just get high but hate the process typically that's more sativa and indica but you know I'm not gonna also show myself short I'm good week [Music] I'm definitely very nice sweet pillow kind of fruity taste ethylene it first goes in which is always nice just interesting the different different flavors you can get from all your different strains in this one's definitely one of the more enjoyable I've smoked I'm digging it all rights to spend a few minutes but uh definitely start to feel kind of really relaxed to kind of sinking into the chair a little bit my arms a little heavy dialogic get a little heavy nothing too crazy in the head going on still very focused clear minded but it's that body tension from all the work for today and the weeks kind of melting away the same time I don't feel like I'm gonna pass out which is nice whenever I smoke in the kiss I'm usually like that in in bed asleep on the couch in the middle of the movie but this one I feel like he's kind of chill would be a nice chill evening you know can still talk to my wife and my friends and have a have a good time but not gonna be bouncing off the walls either which is nice and this mellow - it's not too strong I like that - I don't I don't want to feel bombarded all the time when I'm smoking so I like just this little this nice little relaxing feels like a little like ice especially putted this this little tiny strings kind of pulling me into the chair and just kind of holding me there not too tight I'm just kind of hanging out it's Chris again first manager here at cinder we just smoked on a little lost coast OG from Virginia company very nice relaxing so I'm gonna give this bad boy definitely on smell I'm gonna stay at nine you know you open the jar you get that set right in your face it smells real good smells good when you're smoking it to taste I sick about it seven eight there you know it's a nice dark taste definitely as the inhale how you lose a little bit with an exhale but that happens quite often it's nothing too bad and overall I was gonna give this guy a nice 8 right there real high quality definitely something that I would go out purchased on my own definitely or highly recommend this for somebody who likes a nice indica that's not too heavy", "LFgvm-CrKog": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I am back at you with another flower review today I've got my hands on some revolution Kentucky bluegrass which is a cross of blueberry and huckleberry Kush without further ado let's get to the categories and check this bud out interestingly this stuff really does have a little bit of blue coloration when the light hits it at the right angle that's probably attributed to the blueberry genetics or maybe even the huckleberry cush genetics I could see either having some blue to purple coloration depending on the phenotype and you know the expression of that but the stuff looks really good it might be slightly leafy ER than other revolution strains and slightly less dense but it still looks fantastic it's unbelievably sticky the cures really good so I'm gonna give it an 8.5 out of 10 for looks this flower has a pungent sour floral aroma and then beneath that there's undertones of sour blackberries it's got a very interesting smell it's not these strong is smelling in terms of like the volatility could be a little stronger but it smells fantastic when you break the nugs open I'm gonna give it an 8.5 out of 10 for smell as well the smell of this flower didn't translate incredibly well to the flavor in my personal opinion it was a little more of a dry herbal flavor then the smell led me to believe it would be it still seems cured really well because the smoke was super smooth it just didn't retain as much flavor so I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 for flavor in many different sessions with this flower I found it consistently to be very sedating and relaxing and oftentimes it put me right to sleep I would smoke it right before going to bed and it made my eyes heavy and helped me sleep on a cloud this is very good for relaxation doesn't do as much for generating novel ideas if you're looking for a flower to help you with that but it's extremely relaxing especially on a psychological level I felt like I was very mentally relaxed which i think makes for a good recipe for sleep often times even if it doesn't provide you as much of a body hi in this case the supreme relaxation can help you fall into a nice peaceful rest so I'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10 for the effects I really did like medicating with this stuff so that's gonna give this flower a composite value of eight point two five out of ten which is very solid stuff I would definitely recommend trying this stuff if you're looking for something that'll help you relax sort of quiet your mind a little bit but that's all I got to say today stay safe everybody and let me know if you've tried this stuff in the comments if your experiences are similar or different and if there's any other products I should be checking out right now", "f4qLqbf_aLE": "it's all about that all blood woman that I'm got on a news station and they last a reporter she asked herself as a copepod activist in an epic on air resignation she said [ __ ] it I quit this is such a beautiful time for me to just talk about marijuana I think that was K TV a television so many of you are pro marijuana but you're not pro black house this black woman gonna be pro marijuana but not pro black she would quit her job over to smoke weed to smoke marijuana a plan but she won't quit a job over Mike Brown staff she won't quit her job over black Nationals in the black Nationals and issues these people that are about the prohibition of weed and they think they support weed and love marijuana more than they love maybe they don't like people in black race they love getting high more than as they love they own raising their own people and wanting to smoke marijuana is a good enough reason to quit your damn job now I agree people have a right to smoke weed if they want to I think that it should be decriminalized I think that people should be able to do most of whatever the hell they really want to do without being under the rules laws and regulations of white supremacy so I'm not saying that all she should you know not be able to spur weed and all this and it's illegal and all I'm not making that type of an argument about marijuana because I don't support any of the legal system period but I don't think the prohibition of marijuana addresses the real issue of racial profiling and why black people are being arrested and locked up and just because you legalize marijuana doesn't mean it is that racism white supremacy is going to go away and they try to merge those two issues together and either in order to win us over the crackers to the prohibition of marijuana they try to use racism in it and try to throw in the numbers of how many black people are going to jail based on marijuana indictments they make that relevant to why marijuana need to be made legal they don't care none about black nationalism and the freedom and liberties of black people they just they just care how they can use the argument of marijuana in order to to bring white people to draw white people into that argument to add momentum to their marijuana prohibition argument I think we need to get the word in white supremacy altogether to white supremacy counter we need to counter white supremacy police terrorism get rid of the police department and white supremacist urgent's and black communities we need to run our own communities period not just legalize marijuana legalized everything legalized getting you ass up the hell up out of my goddamn communities period but on the marijuana issue on the marijuana issue you cannot put marijuana as a significant issue above black nationalism we should be some type of European hypocrite is like putting gay rights over black nationalism it's like gay rights movement marijuana prohibition movement is like animal rights activism but none of these people have the courage and hard to say I'm Pro black I'm a black nationalist but I'm pro at all I'm Pro animal rights I'm Pro a plant right I'm Pro homosexuality but none of them will say I'm Pro black I have a problem with that now this news reporter quitting a job great and hopefully marijuana gave us an epiphany to help her move towards greater self-sufficiency to not be under the white man hopefully but black nationalism is more important black power is more important than the prohibition of marijuana the issue with marijuana let me go spiritual issue that I have with marijuana people don't smoke penny I want to know like I said you shouldn't go to jail because you got some marijuana and all that and being the white man all that some marijuana but let's deal with marijuana for a second you talk about you organic you're vegan you don't do with GMO genetically modified foods marijuana is a genetically modified food marijuana is GMO before the white man even got started pushing his GMO movement Monsanto we've been pushing our own GMO movement for a hell of a long time with marijuana it's a genetically modified plant where the way it is grown you take all the males and kill them and you keep the females right the marijuana is essentially a female plant we talk about the extermination of the black man and we talk about how much marijuana we smoked all the marijuana we smoking is contributing to the effeminate Asian it's a female plant it's a genetically modified plant and just like you kill all the male plants with marijuana and just raise the female plants the same you do in society it's metaphysical you take all the black men and lock them up separate them from the women so they won't pollinate right you kill off all the males and just keep the women that's what the marijuana plant is so you think you say you are what you eat if you eat a plant with the Karma that has that all the males have been killed off all the males have been separated from the females and that's the plan that you invest what the hell you think your life gonna look like why do you think we smoke so much marijuana in our communities and we have single woman households in they'll leave the woman and the woman is left to ourselves with the children just like the marijuana plan you are what the [ __ ] you eat this is a reality you are what you ingest so we're talking about you'll just genetically modified foods and you all organic and all that and you were smoking and inhaling a genetically modified plant and the quality of the marijuana is based on its genetic modification I hope you hear what I'm born with that so if you won't be you're gonna totally give up GMO you're gonna have to stop smoking weed and you want to take into consideration that no animal in nature smokes anything good realities from smoke he don't you either you have to train a gorilla on how to smoke we learn how to smoke anything from the white man we got that from the crackers smoking we wasn't smoking nothing before the cracker Cain say the Native Americans are smoking a little tobacco maybe what you call the Native American is enlightenment there's a different type of a white man if you ask me your true Native Americans were the more it's a blackamoors the Maroons the Blackfoot Indians the Seminoles the Washita what you call the Native American that you did you cry for on Columbus Day I love you come on the day when Thanksgiving you cry for that's the white man that you're talking about that's who stole your true native history of America that so-called goddamn Native American that's how history we are the truth natives ain't no pale man the native of any goddamn thing we got smoke people organize give it back we don't need to smoke a damn thing and it particularly not genetically modified plants Native Americans smoke sage and tobacco grown naturally you smoke in a plan that has been genetically modified over time so the black with the marijuana thing okay she quit her job excellent excellent she quit over marijuana disappointing so now she can go wherever she is focus some marijuana with some goddamn white hippy proud to be everything but black proud to be everything but black we're gonna get prosecuted for being black they don't stop and say well you just got marijuana more black people are getting locked up with marijuana then white people are you're getting prosecuted for being black and you're not proud of that you're proud of being a part of marijuana Association hell naw", "wAKsxCQqBDs": "all right i'm going to try something different today uh today i'm shooting on my gopro i have not used it in a long time and mainly i just don't because on my phone i can just immediately upload it to youtube and that's way convenient but i'm just trying to see how the difference in quality would be even though i i don't like how it makes the fisheye wide lens thing and the only way to turn that off is to record on the lowest resolution which i don't want to do that either but today i'm reviewing presidential og i don't have my my pad is my regular template tablet is totally dead right now so i'm using uh my phone this time which is what i usually record on but i mean today i'm using uh i'm having another thing from my hot health order presidential og which i thought i'd reviewed already or but i guess i didn't because um this is basically my last bit left and i guess i didn't realize i hadn't reviewed it yet so i'm almost out but it's uh warming up now i haven't reviewed it yet which was strange but that means i don't have a nice bud to show you up close properly so all i can show you is you know how it looks and they're all ground up it's not dry it's got a little bit of moisture too which is good i like it when it's like slightly off of dry and but not too not too wet or not too dry so yeah it has a very wood woods kind of not pine more woods like actual kind of smells like the outdoors on a wet day like right now a little spicy little peppery the flavoring itself when you actually inhale it oh this is my first debate for the day too which is pretty late for me presidential og indica yeah it's just a straight-up indica it's not a hybrid at all thc is 20 to 20 to 23 see the flavor is citrus pine spicy sweet woody yeah for sure but here's the product description on the website president og is no joke with its reputation of having high thc levels it can put even the most experienced smoker to the test straight produces a powerful urge to much anything in sight which makes it a great stream for those who have a lack of appetite they mean you've had to ride don't think commonly use people suffer from anxiety a little more flavor is a mixture because all we pretty much you know helps with all types of anxieties low mood you know adhd my green main sleepiness flavor is a mixture of citrus subtle hints of pine and a dank aroma of scum well it's got good reviews you know 129 customer reviews 5 stars it's in the 10 gram range so it's a little bit better i bought 3 grams and i came to you know well i think it was on sale when i got it because right now it's ten bucks a gram but i bought it three grams got about three grams and it came to 18 bucks it was on sale when i got it with the indica so it's gonna be a sleepy one like you know i'm also like recording on my gopro but i'm also watching it's connected through my phone so i'm curious as this is even recording or am i like screwing up yeah because if preview is on my phone but i don't even know if it's recording now i just don't like how it does the widescreen thing of like i mean like i don't i'm not embarrassed by my apartment or whatever i just don't need at all to be in there but now i don't even know this is recording [Music] oh no on the top of my camera it says this recording so it was just delay because it uses wi-fi or some [ __ ] instead of bluetooth which is a little annoying but it's because i bought the session so yeah that's it my run of the session's over of that that's funny because i have a session i just had a segment and i'm recording this on a gopro session from 2016 so it's a little outdated by now but you know i just don't use it enough and plus i want to compare when i upload it at its full resolution and frame rate i just want to see what it looks like in period of my phone i'm sure it'll be better but you know i'm using the phone and then my building mic and now i'm using the built-in mic on the gopro i want to see if that's any better as well but now i'm just talking about my gopro and not ready presidential og which even though it's indica now that's hitting me i'm getting a little bit of a chatty area as you can tell maybe but uh i mean it's an indica weed so you wouldn't want to have it during the day or a day where you're not doing anything but you know presidential og was a weird ass name and it didn't say what it's a hybrid of or anything or how they how it got made but it's it's in a decent indica strain nothing to write home about you know i wish i would have some strains that are actually like amazing and like make me want to like also if you hear music in the background it's because i've had final fantasy 7 remake on pause for like two hours but anyways i'm gonna stop recording this and then upload it to see how it looks if you guys like the gopro better than the phone you let me know all all one of you that will actually watch this all right i'm gonna peace out", "PCLWK9qh5Dc": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment today we're going to talk about something called hectane and it's by grandi flora and we like trying new granny floor strains because grandi flora did supercharger and i got some batches of superchargers that i just think are top of the it's some of the best flour in all of la great focus you could maybe be on the debate team with that flower it was just great focus and we love euphoric flowers with focus that are heavy enough for us that's let us smile through our day but today it's all about hectane from granny flora so let me put one more scoop into vapor cup i've already got two in here so this makes three and this is my trusted vapor cup i've been using this thing for about five years and i never look back i don't miss the bong i don't miss anything i wish i would have had this the first time i smoked pot it's incredible and in about a minute and a half it's going to release the water vapor the terpenes the natural oils from the plant and you can get anywhere between 12 and 20 draws and i know the the videos people watch them over and over again but i'm hoping people watch these videos in the end they realize that the journey is incredible and it really is this is my journey and i would say every day i use all my smarts to try and buy the very best flower i can and i use these flowers the day before and so when i do these videos these are just short reviews of a evening's worth of trying to make sure that i'm giving a cultivator who deserves a fair review a fair review and this is someone's work so i take it seriously but you have 100 flowers in a room one's better than the rest even if you're in your own cultivation you know which flower of yours is the best and this is about finding the best and the best for me are happy euphoric heavy enough flowers to focus because i need to grin through my day anyway hectane comes in this packaging you see it's got a gas mask guy with some flames and it says grandiflora genetics and this flower has 29 thc which is right in the realm of what's been really working really well for me i'm going to say 29 because you can see there's something like your highness has flowers in the low 20s and those flowers are euphoric and nice and fun so it's not about the thc but there is some sense that a more thc a little more heavy on the right other something something is like magic right we're looking for those great flowers anyway you can see vapor cup is ready to go you know it's ready to go when you have all the vapor in the straw like that i have this cup set to 335 which is a little harder i use it 3 30 3 35 something like that and if you use it outside on a cold day you might have to turn up the heat even a little bit more because you have to account for the cold outside anyway here we go uh hectane by granny flora out of vapor cup wow so this one i'm kind of gathering myself a little bit so it has an earthy light gassy taste maybe og i would say it's more gassy than og but a gassy og taste with some earthiness that was a giant one for me first first one i'm telling you with vapor cup and you get an og i am telling you you want to know what the pungent pow is it's incredible and also people have got to cut please comment here i think this is really something i don't think people realize how good this thing is yet and it really is this journey of mine is incredible every day i just look forward to doing this this flower's strong enough but realistically for me it was a little heady and it also had a head high and that's not really my thing wasn't really euphoric either so what did i think of hectane i'm giving hectaane by grandiflora and 825. it was good and maybe there's a good customer for this flower who likes those feelings i'd describe it but for me this is not really what i'm looking for so it's an five if you want to get vapor cup if you want to have an unbelievable tasting experience every time you use your flowers and also save a lot of flowers because there's a lot of savings with vapor cup you can get paper cup and it's at vaporcup.com go check it out those reviews read the reviews the reviews you can see how people get like oh my god and yes it's just like that if you're looking for strange go to wheat entertainment.com those strains plus this cup will stone you to the bone and that's the game without upping tolerance thanks for joining in come back tomorrow i'm the doctor party on my friends [Music] you", "0KJx4_C-bf4": "[Music] [Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back for another stray interview this time we got something better than we had last eight okay those are you guys that tuned in last week you got to see I smoked some weed that we didn't really want to smoke it this weed is a little bit different as Dan says we're bringing you some more cake I mean who doesn't like cake right I like cake we've brought you guys wedding cake we've brought you London pound cake this one on honestly in my opinion just our first glance better than both of those this is the lava cake from viola yep viola you know the first time we heard about them was in Colorado obviously they became friendly competition pretty quick out there and they are led by Al Harrington the Hooper you feel girls shout out to Al yeah I don't know how early he got in on that I don't know when we were out working in Colorado like Dan said they were pretty good competition for us out there as far as extracts go I don't know if I remember seeing their branded flour back then this is like 2014 to 2016 or so to viola extracts which I got this at the Hall of flour so we have it sitting on the table here just to show you then this is like their extract packaging this was some diamond sauce but again I'm doing extracts out here now too right they are but that's I believe that's what they started only doing Colorado because it was they were there Instagram was viola extracts so no and now that you mentioned the Harrington thing I do think I remember hearing something about that like the company like his grandma was named viola and that's what the company is named after so it sounds like he's been a part of it since the job yeah regardless we as far as quality goes I always liked their stuff back in the time that we spent Colorado especially live resident it was ghostly when sauce first started poppin they had a lot of really really good sauce back then yeah I don't know what the I don't know what their market presence is like out there now I haven't been back to Colorado in a couple of years but out here they've started to pop up I'd say a lot within the last year for me I've been seeing them a lot on the flower side yeah okay it's something that a lot of brands have been doing a lot of brands that especially just started off more on the extract side going over to the flower side now you've seen 7-10 do it but we've done it ourselves with turf X mile is done it and it's been interesting to see of those kind of concentrate players that try to dabble in the flower game who's been coming with the heat it hasn't yeah I mean definitely their packaging is clean I really like this opaque purple jar it's almost like a flat matte purple I'm at it too great yeah great game baby and then they even if they got a dog little lower on our icon I guess you could say on the top there it's just a bunch of these turning inward kind of like our turf X drops that turn inward so I [ __ ] with that I like the weed - yes the weeds gonna just spark this Jay which is what I was gonna say let's get back to the damn review shout out to buy although they're a great company lava cake guys so this is great pie and they make Girl Scout cookies that's the cross on this and when you take a look at the close-ups it's definitely leaning towards looking like GSC don't you think yeah yeah it's kind of show some characteristics on both definitely but as far as like the way it breaks down and the way it looks at first glance definitely a little bit more cookie leaning is that Audriana rato genetics that does this well I mean yeah we're just talking about how by all the started out in Colorado so I would guess that they picked up this wrong if they're growing themselves out here they could just be sourcing it it's probably Canada auto cut out of MIT I was just a great pie and dim it yeah I mean that's what I was going off of great pie is archived great pie is it we're getting we're getting too deep into it you guard this we have some pretty good wheat in front of us here as far as the smell on it so you're calling it log a cake which to me means it's another one of these pastry slash desert tech terms which have really become popular in the last few years I've got like like you said just the cake ones that we done biscotti gelato all the stuff that's really been hyped lately tends to be strains that are named after like baked goods or like I said other desserts or stuff like that those it's always interesting to see if they're actually gonna taste like what they're named after right you know I'm saying stead of Sour Diesel or og cush it's like back in the day there was a lot more strains called that you know stuff like that what didn't necessarily describe the way it should taste like nine pound hammer yeah I'm go into that expecting anything but when it's called lava cake you're expecting it to be chocolaty kind of lava cake yeah I think it has that primal honestly man I hate to beat a dead horse but I feel like we'd only has so many like different lanes of Terk profiles and like this is kind of remind me of the dog vaults again and I swear I mean it's a lot more sweeter but like it's you know what I mean it's got that same [ __ ] smell and I hit the joint and it's got it's got a little like it's definitely our features with the dogs dogs waltz in the flavor yeah I feel like it's not quite as pervy is that but as far as like more of the more of still that like sweet skunk enos that you get from that strange that's what I'm getting with they're not not as it's in handy yeah you know it's in there for sure but like I said yeah it's like it's more creamy cakey it almost smells like a fresh-baked [ __ ] you know pie or cake I guess I guess you could say cake or pot there's great pie in it it's called lava cake so it smells like a baked pie or baked cake that's what I'm going yeah I'm getting it way more with the smell than I am getting it with flavor on this one the smell it did kind of have to don't tell me it had a little bit of that baked good things that the things you're talking about that I associate more just basically then make cookie or whatever flavor I'm not totally blown away but I do really like the look of this stuff and I do like the smell I guess I was hoping for the flavor to compare or a mine a little bit more of this I gotta I gotta smoke a little bit more of this stuff I'm not I haven't quite made it my mine yet I'm almost ready to judge it I got a drunk my hand I'm gonna pack a bomb there and we're gonna get to rate in this stuff it definitely looks the look and you know like you said the smell is there I think it could smell a little louder what's the look it does look the look but it doesn't talk to talk not just in water it walks the walk a little bit but it doesn't talk to sorry all right what it looks a look yeah I like it well if you were gonna read this stuff we're gonna break down the number hold on to that for one second where are you going with I don't know I got a handful we don't know what to do with it but I am smoking this joint right here and the flavor is good but you know like I said it's got some of that baked goods thing wrong but it's got more jobs walls to me I'm getting a lot of that coming through the flavor more than the smell and yes I don't know man I think I'm just like if you just want me to rate this overall you know I'm gonna give it an 8 I'm giving it an 8 it's good solid week I'm not bad I'm not mad I'm not mad at the purchase it's definitely I was gonna say the buzz might be the best factor you're the best part of this particular strain and listening to Utah kind of gave me reassurance that that's probably the case come on why I'm high off the great pipe and wobble shy that's right whoo like I was saying earlier it does leave a little bit to be desired with the taste I feel like it's good it is good wheat looks I'm going to give a 9 on this one smell I'm gonna give an 8 taste I would probably give a 7 and then buzz I would probably give like a 9 so I don't know whatever that averages out to I think about eight eight and a half I think it's pretty fair for this one it's good when we agreed guys it's really good when we agree we're given an eight across the board there's only two people on the board yeah I mean it's good we like I said not mad at the purchase you know I would love to pick this up just about anywhere it's good smoke could have a little bit better flavor a little bit more pungent of a smell other than that you know looks are pretty damn close I like the way it breaks down like big nugget and all your left is these tiny little stems I hardly any stem weight breaks down really really nice I mean good stuff we've tried probably what this is for me this is a third batch of lava cake I've tried from different place yeah and it's all pretty similar so I'm guessing yes the same I'm pretty sure sir although I've noticed that there's there's one I think that has like more color on it and then one of this wasn't that flight line ringing yeah I've only had the lime-green one once or twice but I think I like this a little bit better lime green purple goodish GB in a Swisher or a Dutch backwards it kind of worried anyways anyways yeah so I think we're gonna leave now yeah we need to get out of things falling apart of the scenes but I gotta pick this first pack it up if you guys are out there still watching this at this point why it would be my view our smoke along with [Music] [Music] money going and proud money going alright I'm the trend time the trip had ass [ __ ] on the planet but the city got the world watch out the worldwide Lily rocking to and Millie slap you silly if I can't you talk", "ztX4-KdQN1A": "how you doing welcome back to dan's buddha boat thicker where today we're gonna be reviewing mac one so let's just get right to it [Music] mack one is a sativa heavy hybrid from a rise that crosses a second generation alien cookies which means its mom is its dad's mom and then they cross that with miracle 15 and you got mac one so what do you say we go take a look at this can abomination the first thing that you're gonna notice about this product is that when you go to open it up you're gonna be hit with the smell of skunk but if you go in for a closer smell you'll notice more of a sweet yet earthy smell that reminds me a lot of cat pee and this freak ain't no slouch when it comes to looks either i mean you got some very rich greens beautiful brown hairs and a layer of trichome so thick it makes the bud look white as the driven snow now that we got that out of the way let's go taste this all right well here we go nostrovia [Music] okay so a little herbal kind of earthy and on the exhale it's almost like an oily vanilla flavor it's not bad it's actually pretty good kind of complex it's not a flavor i've actually run into much in the medical field but definitely like it kind of harsh but uh very complex flavor i like it what do you say we give it a few minutes and then i'll be back with the effects the effects of this flower you'll find are just as unique as its looks in lineage it starts off as a mild energizing buzz now it's not an energizing boost like you would get with banana kush or crack it's more of a slow building yet energizing wave of euphoria which is characteristic of a lot of the alien strains that i've had making it perfect for treating depression and instead of having a drastic crash it slowly lows you back down into a state of well relaxation that you can also feel in your body making this a good strain for treating pain so if you're smoking to fight depression or pain you really have to go and try some mac one from a rise all right guys well that just about does it for me here i'd like to say thank you to all my friends family viewers subscribers i'd like to

your day now imagine your morning routine only this time was a chronic pain all throughout your body it aches to flip over and turn off your alarm it's hard to stand up and walk to the bathroom for many Americans waking up this way is in everyday reality for this pain many doctors practicing conventional medicine may prescribe painkillers or physical therapy however is more and more doctors and patients begin to explore medicinal opportunities controversial solutions to everyday problems have been on the rise especially regarding the use of medical marijuana medical marijuana is a prescribed drug derived from a cannabis plant the cannabis plant itself creates different substances all used for different purposes the products includes CBD THC and industrial hemp used for a wide variety of reasons the controversy of the plant stems from a common usage of it as a brain altering drug the history of marijuana shows that continually changing attitudes regarding its usage and legal status according to an article written by Bethany duro one of the first pieces of legislation regarding marijuana was the marijuana Tax Act of 1937 this act strictly regulated its sale cultivation and possession through a variety of tax duties stamps and other restrictions virtually eliminating legal recreational usage over the next three decades rep restrictions tightened up until the plant was classified as a dangerous drug on par with narcotics and stiff penalties were enacted forth possession the classification as dangerous led to a widely accepted negative stigma of the planet and its users still for many decades Americans resorted to use in cannabis as an emotional coping mechanism similar to that of alcohol or drugs for cultural experiences especially within the Mexican and Indian cultures and more controversial for its perceived medical benefits as more and more Americans began to support the consumption of marijuana to combat chronic pain illness and the physical discomfort associated with diseases like Crohn's disease American legislators similarly began to support its usage according to Bethany de Rome by the end of 2012 15 states had decriminalized possession of marijuana either through a ballot initiative or through legislation while 19 had passed laws allowing for some measure of medical use the development of medicinal marijuana in the medical field has resulted in the more increasingly accepting social view of marijuana and its users however not everyone shares the same acceptance while many US states have passed legislation favoring the medical practice those in opposition to the plants medical benefits are very strong in their ways an example of this conflict can be seen in an article written by Jay Greene outlining the cannabis research conflict in Michigan these research trials according to Greene must be reviewed by the states marijuana Review Board and have been limited immensely by federal restrictions the controversy is commonly credited to the lack of scientific research and a limited correlation to proven health benefits but the scientists in Michigan are working to explore the benefits on adolescents and children as well as more information about the products two biggest components CBD and hc' but conflict in Michigan is nowhere close to being the only disagreement over the usage of medicinal marijuana and the future of the medical practice is unknown according to a journal titled emerging public health and law policy issues concerning state medical cannabis programs 34 states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have adopted or will soon adopt comprehensive medical cannabis programs furthermore nearly two-thirds of the United States population currently lives in a jurisdiction where medical cannabis use is legal and nine out of ten adults nationwide support legalization for medical purposes while the plant is still categorized as a Schedule one drug under federal guidelines the wide-ranging support for the drug leads to the assumption that one day it is very possible that it will become legal at the federal level overall the usage of medicinal marijuana continues to rise in many different medical fields while the plan itself widely recognized for its perceived benefits and diseases like Crohn's disease and other chronic pains still continues to be a subject of controversy in the United States and other parts of the world no doubt the potential federal legality of the practice is becoming more and more of a reality each day throughout its long history with the United States the practice has become a persistent movement that has no foreseeable end in the upcoming future of the United States thank you", "jBuLSg6Objs": "a heads up here as last week Monsanto announced that it had patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana now many are saying this has far-reaching consequences for drug policy and a lot of other things and it goes beyond just warning you about smoking GMO pot here because that in itself is a huge red flag but you see if they pass these laws like they've done in the past you see one man was put in prison for eight years for holding on the seeds from the from the following year and they have to take these seeds that have roundup in them genetically modified already by law guys I'm not sure people are realizing what's happening here farmers trying to plant normal crops go to jail you see if they do this if they pass these laws to where they can run these hybrids on GMO all for profit or for profit and to do something to a plant that doesn't need it ok this plant does fine and it's now become the number one cash crop in the United States over everything continuing to boom and they want to get greedy and they want a GMO it so the thing is here if they do get all these laws in a place then anybody that's caught trying to sell normal marijuana is gonna get smoked you see just like the guy did that went to prison because he didn't want to use their damn seeds people better wake up quick either way you cut it this is what they're doing coming from all angles I put out a report here recently they approved these GMO apples that don't Brown I don't see anybody else talking about it I don't think they're gonna care until they see it with their own eyes or ever they've been consuming it and then it's too late anyway once this all goes down nobody out there is really gonna know if their pot is GMO especially if you're messing with companies that don't want you to know what they're doing they don't want to label the products GMO you know that whole thing hide it from the people big heads up I'll leave links it's been Dabu seven", "eFL7tgeuqx4": "I got something

what they're telling us here is that j1 is very popular it's a hybrid and it's popular for its sativa high-energy effects in fact it inherited everything from its v\u00edctima parents gums are number one and Jack Herer it's famous for its strong and uplifting buzz without cloudiness leaving you free to move and energize with creativity it'll make you feel giggly and happy while alleviating depression anxiety chronic pains arthritis and fatigue okay so Jay one has a nice emerald green frosty color to it with nice orange little hairs it's nice and fluffy you can easily break it up this

smoking a bowl of day one and I'm feeling really happy and giggly I'm feeling energized I want to hear how you feel so post your pictures videos and your strange your favorite strains at 4:24 TOCOM my name is Valeria have a great day [Music]", "KnFX-hwpTYk": "[Music] i love doing multi-strain cultivator reviews and today we're going to talk about king's garden and if you're watching my videos you know i like king's garden and i really think that they give one of the best values for the money in all of uh california you know people are always complaining on the videos it's so expensive it's so expensive and i'm telling you if you're in the marijuana business there is no easy money you never really know what things are going to cost you you don't know what new regulations they're going to put on you you don't know if you're going to pass testing in the end of the day it's a fight to stay above water to beat those expensive that's the real skinny and king's garden does an unbelievable job of giving really good flowers at a moderate price so for those that are on a budget king's garden is definitely something to consider i've been able to collect up 18 strains of king's garden and today we're going to talk about the one i like from the least to the one i like the best and there's a big difference between these flowers and the one i have in my hand right now this is the best and that's all i have left so i'm looking to buy this flower again but i'm going to nip off oh my god i'm gonna get down this is the stash bud can you imagine i'm gonna use the whole thing it's so sad but i'm doing it for the video right so we're gonna stick in enough for a bong hit it's about that much maybe we'll grab a little piece on this side too right we're gonna stick this in right and [Music] we're going to grind it here we go and people have been asking me later i'm going to give a little plug to these guys because this grinder is really good it lasted a really long time this is a santa cruz grinder it's 60 millimeters it's four pieces you get to catch all the little crystals on the bottom while the key it's really something but it grinds up really good and it can take really sticky flowers and cut it up but if you get vapor cup i know that they have a promotion right now you get a free grinder with purchase and uh the free grinder is the same size as this one is a good quality may not be as good as the santa cruz grinder but it's good enough and so if you do want to get a vapor cup now is a good time to consider the item um let me add in a little bit of this this is the winner that we're not going to talk about and i'm going to stick it in there and as i go through these strings my top to bottom list we are going to enjoy a little bit of this and at the end of this definitely i'm going to be the winner and that'll be the end of my day this is a really good flower and it's just a little amount which is a bong hit will give me 12 draws maybe something like that maybe more so this is all in and we're going to stick this down into the vapor cup and in about a minute and a half this thing is going to give me the sweet water vapor all the terpene flavor i am telling you it's so different than i've had a lot of vapes over my life and i would say what makes paper cups so different is this is the thing that can actually really replace the bong the little things are good for a little quick hit if you're sneaking around but this is not for sneaking around this is you've made a change to you don't have to smoke anymore you can get the same feeling from this and it's a much softer sweeter just incredible experience it's only vapor cup that can do it and i love this thing so today's all about king's garden and coming in at number 18 and my least favorite of all the king's garden strains is something called j-dog and it comes in this baller jar and this flower has 22 percent thc it's an indica hybrid they call it j dog and for me it was the dog of the ruts the it's not the real run just just the run of the crowd j dog my least favorite of all the king's garden strains i think i got paid if i'm right around 45 for this at the one year anniversary of dr green thumbs opening and for 45 dollars this is a whole lot of flour for 45 dollars i think this is a whole quarter in here and it was definitely worth the money but for me i'm looking for the best flower and this one didn't cut it it was my least favorite of all the king's garden and we're moving on up number 18 jdog we're moving up to number 17. number 17 is something called ninja fruit this flower has 18 thc and it's a hybrid and it was my 17th favorite king's garden strain but we're moving up coming in at number 16 we have something called fire cookies this flower has 18 thc it's an indica hybrid and we're moving up to better flower coming in at number 15. i hope you're enjoying these pictures there's great pictures of these flowers here coming at number 15 you have something called gelato there's 18 thc and it's a hybrid but we're moving on up to even better flower coming in at number 14 we have something called sfvog sfv stands for sandy valley excuse me san fernando valley and that's where we are this flower has 26 thc and it's a hybrid but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number 13 is og king this flower has 27 thc and it's an indica hybrid and i just thought this flower was okay we're still moving up to where the better king's garden flower start this flower was just okay to me and number 13 og king but we're moving on up coming in at number 12 is something called 33 bananas this flower has 27 thc it's an indica hybrid and it was my 12th favorite of all the king's garden strains but we're moving up to even better flower and i think at number 11 is where king's garden starts to get better for me purple mambo was good but i actually gifted one of these to one of my friends this flower has 19 thc and it's an indica and i really like this flower and if you get a chance to try the purple mamba by king's garden it's a good one it's 19 it's not a killer but it's definitely good so vapor cup is ready to go and you can see there's a lot of vapor in the straw already i actually waited longer than i have to this cup is set to 330 degrees and inside is the winner which i'm not telling you what it is yet wow that's why i love vapor cup can you imagine from a little bong you can get 10 12 draws like that and at the end you enjoy the terpene profile that will take you to another planet or as i like to say stone you to the bone but we're moving on up and coming in at number number 10 we have something called banana og this flower has 26 thc and it's an indica hybrid and this is where like purple mama starts to get better banana og a little bit better and this flower's good and banana og is always strong flour so this is where you're starting to get into stronger flour but we're moving on up coming in at number nine we have something called dream weaver number four and this flower was an absolutely great vape from vapor cup it only had 17 thc it's a hybrid but the vape was so good the feeling was nice and light and happy and i like green we were number four it was a winner for me and it comes in at number nine but we're moving on up coming in at number eight we have something called kings garden ghost og i got a comment the other day oh i want to try that and you should 26 thc it's an indica and this is where the flower's even getting stronger right about here ghost og is strong but we're moving on up to even stronger flower coming at number seven we have something called ice cream cake number eight and ice cream cake number eight has 24 thc it's indica hybrid and this flower is good but we're moving up to even better flour coming in at number six we have something called gelato number 33 so this is the second time and you can see how the growers can be tricky a little bit i bought gelato and you can see it's placed in number 15 but then they had a gelato 33. so people were talking about it in the post so i went out and grabbed it so i grabbed gelato a second time engine item number 33 got number six this flower's got 24 thc and it's a hybrid and it's moving up it was definitely stronger with 24 than the version that had 18 right but we're moving on up and coming in at number five we have something with a crazy name called the piho and the piho is real good and i would say when i triumph kings when i tried king's garden in the beginning i was able to grab a lot of these really good strains right off the bat uh dr green thumbs uh king's garden must have placed a really good strains in there so a lot of these finds were early finds i got him in the beginning and that's really why i prefer king's garden because at the beginning i'm like wow look at that good one good one good one and also like i said it's moderately priced if you want good moderate place our king's garden is definitely worth consideration number five pie hoe but we're moving on up coming in at number four we have something called easton's cut and this flower is strong and good this flower is a hybrid it's 25 uh someone posted that uh mr easton or mr easton had passed away and this was a memorial to him so we uh shout out uh your flower's great uh rest mr easton may rest in peace i don't want to make it lonely but that's what someone posted so they gave you a good flower buddy uh coming in number four easton's cut but we're moving on up coming in at number three we have something called the big smooth this flower has 19 thc and it's a hybrid and this was such an enjoyable vape out of april cup if you have vapor cup run down and get yourself some big smooth i am telling you that vape's so enjoyable you can watch tv and just vape the big smooth for hours and that's the great thing about vapor cup that that straw will sit in there this thing auto offs in 18 minutes smoke ring but you know with uh vapor cup you can let it sit there and just come back whenever you want to i'm telling you i love this thing coming in number three big smooth but we're moving on up and coming in at number two we have one of my favorites if you're following this channel then you i talk about this flower all the time this is jack herrera by king's garden this flower has 19

herrera it's a must try this thing is incredible and number two but we're moving on up to number one and the number one flower of all of king's garden is something called acetic grapes this flower's got 24 thc it's an indeca hybrid and this flower has the game if you see hasidic grapes by king's garden this is the buy this is the best of king's garden and i promise you it will stone you to the

canopedia where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing orange kush by our friends over at true infusion and you guys this is a brand new strain for the channel here let's talk about it so orange kush is an indica dominant hybrid strain that is a cross between orange bud and my probably all-time favorite oh g kush so the classic og kush flavor in this so i am going to go ahead and bring this stuff up on the screen to show you guys and then i'm going to pop the top on this awesome little jar and then we're going to take a look at it together okay so you guys just had a chance to see it what did you guys think of this butt let me know in the comments below but i will tell you what you guys this stuff was harvested on the 12th of june so today just you know for reference here i am filming this on the 27th of july so this is a bit old this ganja is not super fresh probably a month and a half old um but i'm still so excited to try this out and see what this stuff is all about here so okay you guys immediately there's a reason they call it orange bud and it's funny i probably like i'm not super into the tangy or orange terps but i still wanted to get this because of that orange push flavor in there it's always been a classic of mine so i can tell you guys that from a terp standpoint they're not insanely insanely strong but they are there for sure like a lot more than a lot of the other true infusion strains so big ups to you guys on true infusion at true infusion excuse me for getting those terps back on point here at least with this orange kush because i'll tell you what they are strong strong citrusy hints you guys so if you like flavors like along the tangent orange lines it'll smell like you're biting into an orange or a tangerine no joke you guys that's what this stuff smells like so from a looks perspective first of all you guys i want to say these nugs are dense they're like little mini rocks honestly you guys um you guys this stuff looks awesome phenomenal i'm gonna hide my face and see if this zooms in on this or at least focuses a tiny bit on this bud look at the proportions of crystals to hairs like you guys this is what bud is supposed to look like it's just straight glistening and honestly oh my god there's thc all over this stuff so one thing i want to talk to you guys about is true infusion and their transparency what do i mean by that so on all of the true infusion products they put these little qr codes and that brings you to their testing site this stuff tested out at 22.25 active thc 25.66 total cannabinoids you guys that is some potent and strong ass ganja um so you guys i mean it's got the smell it's got the looks like man it's just such good looking butt it's mostly purple honestly with these bright orange hairs and like amazingly well proportioned and it's like it's just glistening the the trichomes are literally screaming off of this bud they're so fat um so you guys again the fact that it's dry it isn't super malleable man this stuff is is i'm excited to try it i'm not gonna lie you guys it's like it's not gonna be make or break because it's not you know the freshest that it could possibly be it retain the terps and that's all we're looking for so without further ado let's get this review really cooking right now where we get to the good stuff today i am going to be enjoying this orange kush out of my arizer extreme q vape as you guys see we've got this bad boy set it's actually set to 375 degrees it's at 374 and it's hovering right now we'll see if i'll hold it there to see if it goes up to temp in the time oh look at it still just wanting to hover at 374 you guys but i assure you it'll be up to temp by the time i start puffing this stuff then i've got two male ends here one of the male ends the one with the screen i just cleaned that bad boy out as you guys can tell that's going into my vaporizer and then the other side side is going into my you guessed it scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler the first chamber has been left empty that actually is where carbon is but there's no ash that will be getting in the second filtration chamber which is where my brand new purified water is and then in the third chamber i've got a brand new organic cotton filter to just filter out any remaining impurities but i know the guys over at trueinfusion purge out all the crap and they don't spray any [ __ ] all over their medicine so you guys big ups to them on that so without further ado what do you guys say we try out some of this orange kush by true infusion i'm ready and if you guys are ready let's start our engines and get this party started okay so that was not a big huge rip it's actually bigger than i thought it was gonna be so really ultra smooth immediately hit with that citrus flavor you guys it's seriously when i blew out now i've got like i just ha i just tasted an orange slice and i've got that you know filling my mouth so i bet you that flavor is going to develop even more on the second pull let's find out okay so you guys that was real smooth like as smooth as it possibly gets and i got a nice juicy juicy one this stuff has got flavor all over it if you're into citrus if you're into orange bud or you're into og kush that tastes like oranges i mean this i don't get any of the kush flavor which is unfortunate because that was what i was hoping for i was really hoping that the orange was going to be more subtle and the kush was going to be more prominent but i should know with a strain like the name orange kush that it's going to be more orange and i went in kind of expecting that was what it was going to be like but i want to finish out this bowl right now see if this flavor develops anymore see what the actual medicine and the effects are like but while i'm doing that i want to bring this stuff up on the screen right now so you guys can check it out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so here it comes now so here is the orange kush by true infusion you guys can we reflect on how frosty this butt is like it is just straight up covered in trichomes the hairs have trichomes on them it's got that you know nice purple undertone on the bud as far as the coloration goes and these are really densely packed buds so to see such great proportions between the crystals and the hairs is absolutely amazing this is some unbelievable looking dank okay so what did you guys think of this orange kush under the macro lens now me personally you guys i think this stuff is ridiculous like as far as what bud can look like or should look like or you know uh whatever i mean you know as far as crystals to hair it's just the bud structure that you know not using an auto trimmer actually trimming the buds by hand boom trimmed right up to the buds no the extra leaf matter on there i mean to me i love it i love the look of this stuff and you guys let's talk about my experience what the the flavor was like what the medicine is doing to me so you guys i'm getting you know i know this is labeled as an indica hybrid probably hasn't sat in long enough you know for me to tell you it's like more of a hybrid i'm just am getting personally a very hybrid effect and you know it is pretty cerebral so i do have my brain is kind of just like it's kind of moving you know so but my body's kind of relaxed so it really is true to that hybrid name um and what was the smoke like i mean that orange flavor if you guys vape and i i want to like turn you guys on to vaping okay because if you like the taste of ganja you will love vaping it's the cleanest way to ingest your medicine and it's just all terpenes you're literally just getting all of the flavor from the ganja so like when i report these things like you guys watch other reviews do you see other people doing reviews who are you know lighting their bud up smoking joints whatever it is you guys the fl did you not think that you know having it in a rolling paper and actually smoking it burning it at that hot temperature you know causing combustion does that not change the flavor and i'm not saying that there's good or bad one way or another but like if you like flavor if you want to have terpene retention if you want you know to taste what you're actually smoking or you know it's my best situation it's vaping if you want to taste your medicine vaping is the best way to ingest it it's the healthiest way to ingest it but like this orange flavor was there from the beginning the end and it was like solid you guys i mean i'm not a fan of orange flavors but i know a lot of you guys out there are so if you are into them like it gets between you know out of ten it gets like a two to two and a half in that category but like but the smoke itself ultra vape in my situation ultra ultra smooth you guys this is clean medicine and again the feelings and effects i'm getting are just like this is clean medicine this is one reason i like the true infusion product because it's just clean like this is this is like what good medicine should be like and when you've ever had that stuff like i'm actually starting to figure out the different cut like kind of type of i guess high quote-unquote um but that one where it's kind of like whooshing in your head that in my opinion is actually the effect of like them not purging everything out there's still being something in there you know it having some problem you know and and again whether it be sprayed with something or you know whatever it might be i'm starting to not like that type of high quote unquote you know where it's just like this like heavy feeling on my head like your head should feel like good you know it shouldn't be like a whooshing you know um but anyways that's beside the point what i want to do you guys is i'm going to bring it up on the screen one more time i want to show you this stuff one more time and then i'm going to break down what my rating is for this stuff so we can get you guys a final score and verdict on this uh orange kush by true infusion okay so you've seen it multiple times you guys i'm gonna say it again i've said it multiple times now i know this video is dragging out here but no joke this stuff looks ridiculous it's sloppy this is filthy this stuff and it smells like a freaking orange you guys i mean this is great great great looking dank and honestly i am proud to put that into my body um so let's go down here's how i'm going to start doing these breakdowns i want to start giving you guys the rating out of 10 obviously as i always did but i want to show you i want to show you how i came to the conclusion where i got to the 10 okay so basically i'm going to break the 10 points up into two excuse me four different categories each assigned 2.5 points each to make up the total of 10 points total so in the looks category it's a 2.5 what do you guys think it was not gonna get a hundred out of a hundred and looks category hell yeah it's gonna get a hundred out of a hundred smell category it's gonna get a 2 to a 2.5 okay so i'm kind of undecided in that category and we'll talk about that at the end because the smell is there it's not you know let's actually let's do this no the cat i actually think smell a two is a good on a smell two out of two out of two point five is a great i mean that's great you guys you're not getting the next is a 2.5 so it's a 2 out of 2.5 in the smell category so we got 2.5 in the looks department smell department we're at a two in the taste department this is where i'd say it's gonna go between a two to two point five because it is all flavor you guys if you're into these terpenes i'm personally not the biggest fan i don't say i'm not enjoying them but it's just not my personal forte i like a lot of the you know wedding cakes and you know those type of sweetness like a member berries you know um but it's gonna get between a two to a two point five in the taste category okay the potency i'm gonna put it at 1.5 to a two okay no higher than a two absolutely not but a 1.5 to a two so on basically in the potency category and in the taste category i'm between a half of a point and i don't know which one would get that half a point i've kind of wrapped my brain to decide which should get it but i think this is an 8.5 you guys i was thinking it was going to be an eight because at first i was thinking you know it would be 2.5 in the looks category 2 in the smell category 1.5 in the potency category and a 2 in the taste category but the more i thought about the taste and even the more i thought about the potency i'm like man this is kind of like it is good stuff it just doesn't like hit really really hard and really really strong you know um and again maybe maybe that's because of tolerance or whatever but like if you are a lightweight i mean you guys it's going to affect you so be careful with this medicine um so but the taste category again between a 2 to a 2.5 so i'm still going to give it an 8.5 i don't know which category i'd assign maybe maybe i would give it a 2.5 in the taste category because if you guys do taste this stuff the taste is there it does have all the terps so like you know what i'm going to give it a 100 i'll give it a 100 and potency will just keep it 1.5 you know not to say that it's not potent or it couldn't be a two but like i want to assign these the points so you guys tell how i got to an 8.5 so damn gina 8.5 for the orange kush and it's funny as i'm like looking at my eyes i'm like damn maybe it's a two in there maybe it's a two in the potency category and and a two in the taste category we'll take the 2.5 down but regardless you guys this is bomb stuff pick some of this stuff up if you see it out give the um guys a true infusion a big ops big ups to will over at level up who hooked me up with this stuff um you know great great dude very knowledgeable and uh i like somebody else who also vapes over there um it's a great great community you guys join the vaping community it's unbelievable change your life you'll feel better your medicine will affect you in a much cleaner way you're not going to be quite as down and i will tell you what load some of this in first thing that you do and you'll be rock and roll orange kush buy true infusion 8.5 until the next one which is going to be huge i can't wait for you guys to see that let me know if there's something out there that is floating around that is dank that fireworks on the search for the 10. we haven't had a 10 yet i don't even think we've had a 9.5 yet you guys so let's bring it share with me what you guys want to see reviewed and until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "KrMiVK3TF3I": "hi there welcome to another one of my videos thank you for taking the time to watch them I also want to welcome all the new YouTube subscribers Twitter followers and Instagram followers to the family let's get right to it in this video I'm gonna tell you about the very white stream that I picked up from harvest and Tallahassee I paid $50 for this 8th and it came in at 20 point 24 percent THC green and purple buds with orange hairs and decent amount of trichomes this 8th weighed 3 point 59 grams this strange flavor and smell was pretty much the same on both that was a combination of berry pine and arable I'll do the effects I had extremely high hopes for this training Whitewood was one of my top five all-time favorite strains so when I saw it in this strange linear I literally just order it right away way to Fred and tried it then it turns out to be great flavor with supplement effects yeah sup man I didn't feel completely relaxed from the effects kicked in calm my excit went away but stress was able to trigger my mood swings it did know my pain from about a 6 to 5 but that's it that's why I called it something ethics plus they weren't in your face effect either I don't know with white wood on the zinnias and after trying gingerbread man and I was expecting more so i dubbed this one the strain that could but then can i work on this train yes but I wasn't supposed to this is a strain I picked for last week's sleep in into work relaxation which ended up being quickly replaced by different dispensaries are so I will not be getting this train again so I will not be using this train anytime of the day or night I hope this helps you medicate right have a great", "S9wfha4eDnQ": "hey guys what's up how you doing good to have some good friends I got hooked up with this this is some from fresh baked and I believe he got it up at a shop close to Palm Springs look at that $75 for an eighth check this [ __ ] out 27 percent THC 31.4 total cannabinoids it's called cherry fritter amazing little jar it's like glass damn they look for us and the cherry frittata little hints of purple in there unless I got it nice and cold I'm gonna almost bet this is indoor could be wrong there this time of year could be wrong yes we get a little bit of a little THCA in here too not a lot of Terps or anything on that and so we're gonna get sated guys so I hope you guys are ready for this the Queen Mary's got got her lights off usually they got the my Christmas lights and then the smoke stacks are always lit up it's a fresh babe to us we're gonna try to do a couple different ways submarines damn rings whatever you want to call them you guys know how I like to call it I always get funny sometimes there's some new people that are get on here and like why do you call it that it's like it's been called it for so many [ __ ] years that was what I was looking back at post seven years ago some beautiful gold shatter and [ __ ] and [ __ ] it's been 2015 think that's when we were so jealous so five years already alright guys little boys we're done Tori once everybody's before you beat us before your shots we're about to have a nice faded slash here does that my next I can eat blue shirt on shout out to those guys always killing and always innovating something new they always are trying to change the game again came out with one of the better closed-loop systems back in the day when me and Shido first started all this and they are continuing to improving they've got like all kinds of new stuff from new heaters to new short pants setups - I think they got some other [ __ ] worst I don't want to talk about it all but very cool guys check them out if you guys are into extracting and I love them because I ever need a tiny part or a big part they always got it and they've been open the entire time of this epidemic has been going down on Californians getting crazy though I think a hearing like Los Angeles County be extended to lockdown until August and you got to have Maggie mask on anytime you go out in public no matter where you go it's worth the mountain at all times I don't know how much they're enforcing them because I don't like using it when I'm skateboarding and [ __ ] yeah I think it's ridiculous if you're running into himself it's not gonna I'm not gonna be good to try to breathe through a mask I guess you're right you know they do make those masters for like altitude mask to make it harder for you to breathe strengthen your lungs and [ __ ] which is great but I don't think everybody in general comes to be ready i lagers now if I ever get a ticket I still got to do that skateboarding Long Beach but at this point I'm just saying words because I've been saying it for too [ __ ] long so hopefully I get out tomorrow guys it is 2:00 2:30 in the morning or self late-night session we got the monarch out here with a cherry fritter you guys know I'm a cherry fan I do chest and this one's so strong as 27 percent data it was hilarious women I have said this sort of million tons but 2015 when we was in chalice all the top entries was like 23 to 28 you know something I even might be up to the 30% oz but usually like 23 to 28 percent or so and in all the top entries I think if I looked at your think you know from indicate is we were a third place indica in because Kiba sativas usually have little more THC just usually how it is and indicas will have a little bit of CBD and Enid to offset it but um I don't really like I said I think a lot of times every time you guys us forever a lot of times it's the terpene profiles can affect your high and modulated a lot more than any kind of CBD what littles in it um now board I was gonna say is all the entries was like 22 to 28 percent or higher artists artists that got third place order em when I became something like 19 percent it's like an old school oh gee that's pretty high for medic in the day it's got that old-school tastes tons of terpenes and still got highest [ __ ] so don't always let the terpene profile you know it definitely helps me hide but I mean priming the TX THC percentile effect your high because they could also be the Turks this one's got good trip in high percentage I'll a boat so we didn't treat monster vapors put me at three shots we're gonna do a little submarine he's gonna do a bomber hip slam this beer for these guys [Music] I don't know if I missed a spot shaving I think I did I think I miss like one over here highly recommended guys now systems that bugs here I think my friend said he paid forty-four it may be thirty five or forty seven you could probably get a good better than you on him but it goes to show you he can't be going for that higher price paying on where you're located because they're around in this California you're gonna notice some of the shops that are up in LA are gonna be a little more expensive the ones down south honey out of both mine is at first dad enjoy them being for sale [Music] yeah that's but I'll show you guys this real quick there's Queen Mary all dark however want me to move this you let's keep going guys I'm gonna get three different ways so what I'm doing is I'm actually busting out the puff kill and I got it with the original attachment the original on card captor I still got the oil glass ones too so what I learned with these guys for one if it's a diamond break them up they just realize I didn't grab a banner yeah remember I get for the hottest setting guys and I like to put like twice as big a DAB as I normally take maybe even three times because more you put in there you're gonna get more smoke guys so if he has ever seen s didn't tiny lots of smoke it's because it's not gonna heat it up as like a nail wood where it's vaporizing every single bit of it okay when you hit this thing you get in like three four times sometimes there's certainly stuff in it so that's why the smoke so little but if you put a lot in it guys you're gonna get a bigger rip you know you still get multiple hits and it's never gonna be the same size of this once again any regular ring Center vaporize it completely and then after it's ready to get up a set a second I guess limos are another military vaporize for beer for your shots this is a tough kid Jamboree see I didn't even have hear of that so I'm gonna heat it up again I take to you guys and a huge puddle that was Thomas Foster I didn't pour that one a lot of fun [Music] when I first started doing these videos I have two beers already poured into different glasses I did that on purpose because before the video I did these high pours tried to get rid of as much carbonation as I can as time went on I started pouring beers in front of you guys I'd get whole bunch of people saying you're not pouring it right but the number-one thing was it was just taking too [ __ ] long to pour the beers so I started cutting corners and pouring them with a little angle and [ __ ] tough going still I mean I look I love a good pure THC a lot of times the terpenes a lot of these companies and people do or way too much but even that a lot of the concentrates are so good I still like a good shatter tell you what if you get something makes us a really good shattered no here's some funny [ __ ] I don't know if I'm told mister um so I line it up I got no record my Challenger they told me you got a new car I was driving down the road these cops this is not too long it pulled me over and they said where she played she said I just got it and I maybe turn it off put my hands on the steering and then they wanted me to put on a mask even though none of them had masks and three cop cars got behind me three-time Curtis got behind me they took my driver's license they got the VIN number of the car I took my hands off the steering on the guy behind me up put your hands assume the guy is kind of getting drawn on me that was insane all for them to say you're right it was purchased three four days ago moving on none of them I'd mask alright guys one more that first one got me guys and I gotta let that beer coming well yeah talks kind of crazy nowadays unfair father thank you sicko that was the other thing they asked her I had my logo from where like you know I live my apartment my parking path you know where is that was like you guys know where it is right up there was like right around the corner I was on that was only a few blocks from my house and these kinds of park here and they parked there I don't know maybe they recognized me it was a very unusual stop that when you got my guns our team ends are we getting shot for just getting a new car and you can't even get your plates you get it they did their mailing them to me so I mean I can't do anything else they keep like the sticker with all the information in the windshield tops of craziness not ok all right [ __ ] unforgiveness everybody's put there pretty sure turning your puffs days plus they're not you know volcano I here has a big thing that's really good what other heroes birthday's coming up at the end of July might be moving soon I live this a burger then it's a lot better than the other one at home you say for sure but this one is still always under construction you know I want one that has a lot more amenities that are available so one of the ships I've broken actually use this other one it seems really nice on my side even got like at tennis courts after our basketball courts gated community I think they even out yeah they have saltwater swimming I hate moving but I'm just gonna pack my [ __ ] hire some movers when I just when I moved from building a building here me and my friends kind of did it it was not too bad since I'm moving out of this get some hay a saltwater sample right or something full lap pool no jacuzzis hot tubs sauna steam room I believe me I'll never get the beer down I'll start coffee I'm faded I hope you guys are too it is Friday night as it is party time Saturday morning oh [ __ ] it's like 2:30 here maybe even closer to 3 it's all my 6 a.m. in the East Coast I'm so high man everything's off they don't have the lights on him I met it turned it off what if they're turning those on anymore I'm gonna have to check my stay I stay fade into one a minute's peace", "Crc9OKhpuNE": "I'll be rolling rolling I'll be smoking too Oh gasps my stash like I'm rolling in a stolen truck yeah you know sure we see the great thing is the bait Bank doe - jeez well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another strain review today we are checking out another one from Lumpy's another one a few um peas in the past but it's been a minute since we did one I want to say the last one we did was the Cali berry right yes we did the Cali berry a few months ago something like that bring it to you Lumpy's apple fritter and when i crack the jar I see perc a little bit of perp in there for sure and what is it it smells it smells along the lines of the dogs walls but is not quite that so I would say it smells kind of pervy yeah so it's supposedly apple fritters supposedly sour apple and animal cookies okay and then I think the sour apple I know it has I think it's sour D in Sydney 99 okay so yeah that's that's a nice lineage I don't know what sour apple is but there's animal cookies there's some diesel in there I just told you what sour apple is Cindy 99 Sour Diesel I'm sorry there you go sorry I agree though all the all the parents that went into that one every all stuff I would want to smoke on its own you know so that's usually a good start exactly it's better that then has like og cross with blue dream and I'm like oh why'd you go and do that - oh gee you know dude this smell is really similar to that dogs walls from from elemental wellness back in the day which is we that I love I love this turf it's actually kind of rare I feel like you know it's almost like the herbal turf but a little different yeah you definitely for me I definitely get those like sour II kind of fuelie notes in the beginning but then it's kind of more of like a sweet creamy thing like you're talking about you know I'm almost getting like as I've just broke that up I kind of got like almost like a little cheesy funk or something you know I'm really trippin on the snow guys like I like it there's many layers to it there's layers to that's a good word to describe it there's layers to the smell I'm gonna go ahead and light this joints I forgot we had it rolled I really want to taste this stuff I love me some purp great game in this thing I wonder how far we are into this video there's always somebody that comments down below the exact time and moment that one of us takes our first rip because if we're on top of our [ __ ] it's usually a minute two men in 30 seconds most of time it's usually two minutes and a half minutes and people were like hey I thought you guys were gonna [ __ ] smoke in these videos I don't you guys did high no we just blab on we're just blab blab blab but lighten up this Jeffrey here gonna get high let's see how it tastes huh definitely a good burpy I get purp on the inhale but you do get a little bit of that like almost gas eNOS I'm guessing it's coming from the sour apple or the sour deep very smooth out of the bone I like it the first and this will hit off the joints Barry I get a perfect flavor guys almost like yeah it's sweet like a sweet candy like a like a Laffy Taffy ah that's a little extreme but if I had to tie it to some it's almost like a great walkie-talkies yeah I kind of like that dogs waltz comparison that you drew cuz one that's a strain I haven't smoked in forever and I really missed back in the days when elemental had fire in San Jose that was one of our favorite strains to get from them similar parents I guess I left the cam yeah and then a vertical rise at the Kemp sister of the herbal I don't know after days Ray's dog yeah I think it was Charles about an Urkel so you get kind of that fuelly kind of more pungent thing going on from the chem whereas in this strain you have it with the sour and then you know got the cookies bringing in some of those may be sweet perk Terps not like truth no I can pure Oracle but it's a little very very hint in there to man and wife you know coming from that like great D flavor I'm getting but I almost got like a little berry flavor and there's really good guys yeah lots of lots of depth I feel like to the smells and the flavor of this stuff yeah it's been a while I think since we it may have not I don't know but I think it's been a while since we have we had honestly the best characteristic of this weed to me is the smell so far yeah the taste is good don't get me wrong but the smell I sat there and tripped on it for a minute different smell is what I am always going for you know it's always my number one criteria this strain actually won the cannabis cup a couple of years ago I want to say 2016 pack that for hell yeah y'all this trade year there you go there you go fair's fair yeah but this one the cup a couple of years ago that one was hitting out like 25 percent THC this one right here is coming in at 21.5 1/4 cultivated on 1213 package on 114 so Wow we picked this up a couple of weeks bail it's sitting on it took forever to do these reviews but I'm surprised it still has this good Terps after being packaged about four or five months ago that's really good I mean it stays like 70 degrees in hearing some of the dispensaries I'm sure go a little hot you know one of at least like that not the nice ones but yeah but we've only had it for a week or two and you know the shop it's still really they had it for four months before that so it's not usually when we get weed that was packaged a few months ago in California it's gonna be dry it's gonna be stale that's good the nose isn't gonna be there the way it is on this so I'm definitely impressed this has kind of been I don't want to say their flagship strain but one of their biggest strains over the last I don't know year - maybe longer sure this is the one that really put Lumpy's on the map for me personally and I think there's a lot of other people know yet for sure this is only my second time having it not gonna lie but the first time I believe was like you know beginning in this year maybe even like December something like that and fire both times like he said the freighter you talk about yeah the apple fritter is that what I said yeah I just didn't know if you meant Lumpy's in jail no no no that was for yeah yeah I've had Lumpy's a few other times Cali berry few of their other ones this is my first time trying the apple fritter I saw a batch of it before like one of my buddies just had like one left over and it was like a nicer nug as I look at this stuff it's some you know some of these bugs are a little bit smaller in these this particular jar that I'm looking at not necessarily the tightest no nuts what we're dense at least these particular notes sometimes if you get some like bottom or like more side note right they might just look like that if we were to see some tops of this it might be a totally different story yeah I don't know if I had to get down on rating this one I really like it I like this strain in general I think this is super fire I'm not sure if this is I do I know this isn't the best batch they've ever grown you know if you just want to go based on test results they've definitely grown more potent looking backwards some of the photos I've seen on their Instagram and from other people online I got I got a crazy little you know it's crazy sorry I just totally cut you off yeah go ahead what are you saying go ahead uncle Gard okay oh you know you're a Buddhist daughter you know how a [ __ ] beer has this always like 3.4 whatever the push there it's crazy how we can't get weed like that and do you think we will see a day that we do being that we can be able to grow apple fritter at parking the same percentage every single time well I mean there's so many variables with growing wheat everybody tell me that things are gonna be a little bit different and I think it's way easier I think it's way easier to control like every single just about every single very when you're brewing so you're saying that we will see the day no I'm saying that I don't I think that I think you can control way more of the important variables when making beer obviously I've never [ __ ] made beer I don't know anything about it but this is just what I do right now me too there are way more variables with ie just being that every strain is different yeah each one has different optimum requirement exactly I don't I don't think we're gonna see the day either I need to be able to grow the same plant at the same THC percentage every time that's not going to happen especially when you have the genetic getting weaker and weaker as you clone down I just don't see it happening all you scientists out there please prove us wrong or otherwise or other known or whatever the [ __ ] other stupid English anyways I almost rate this stuff yeah I was gonna say the best thing about this one like you kind of alluded to earlier is the nose for sure that's the first I mean and for being packaged four or five months ago and still smelling this good yeah obviously it was dried and cured properly even perfectly I would say it's keeping alone I would have loved to smell this on the plant or smell it like right after it was like fresh isn't you know at packaging time it's just to see if it was even more crazy and I love doing I would have loved to just rub the sugar that's the best part about growing at so that's the one thing I miss the most about growing is just being able to like just smell the evolution of the Terps knowing what it smells like at early the flowers date of the fire late flower stages and then like you know the color starts to turn yeah and then like once you cut it down and like after the chop and then how it how that kind of flavor just kind of like changes to that final project you know I like being able to see that evolution and like you're talking about just walking in there and doing that form is amazing so yeah we got a 10 on the smell Wow this stuff gets me high man I'm like really high sorry for the stunt 110 on the smell what's next flavor flavors not far behind but super smooth it's very smooth it could just be like more more beautiful white ash it beautiful white ass definitely that's for sure hundred percent so flavor I'm gonna give it eight I'm just gonna grab this a V you could just be more I'm gonna go with the word more really it could be it could be just more pungent I like the flavor on this one I think it's pretty good I did like it a little bit better out of the bomb than the joy let me give it one more bigger but yeah I'm gonna stick with a eight because we're running out of time on this damn video effect effects good I'm just now assessing it like I'm pretty pretty Spacey pretty a bomb-ass song right now it's very creative very uplifting it doesn't make me want to just sit here and be lazy all day so I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it it I'm gonna give it a 9 I actually really like the high so overall I'm gonna give it I don't know if those average out - I'm gonna give it a 9 9 9 so as far as the buzz goes I cheated a little bit on this one and I smoked some a couple of days ago we kind of split these last couple notes we had up and in between these jars so we could do this video or whatever but it definitely hits me like that at first it's kind of like uplifting euphoric very like clear motivational I guess I don't know what the right word for it is but it's very like uplifting at first but at least for me when I smoked it the other day it just completely did a 180 on me like mmm and then maybe 30 minutes 45 minutes after smoking it because I was feeling like this last time I smoked it a couple of days ago then the coffin in 30 minutes later yeah yeah I guess I'm coffee'd up right now I could have something to do that overall overall I'm gonna give this a solid nine and a half nine point five yeah I like the flavor on it the smell 10 flavor I'm giving that like a 9 buzz I'm giving you no flu Niner ten everything about this is pretty much a 9/10 so I'm gonna go nine point five it's good we apple fritter from lumpy shoutout to Lumpy's for growing some

stream review today we're gonna be reviewing purple punch [Music] purple punch is a sweet union of larry og and grand daddy purple this is a delicious dessert stream that it's better when you like after dinner you just smoke one of these you can start feeling really relaxed look at the size of this knot okay this is the this is a seven gram nug look at this he said oh my whole palm the ceiling there's a beauty look at that look at the little logs down it has like little nugs inside nuts like if you if you look in here you see this little knot inside of the knot inside of the nog i think they call it foxtail and don't quote me on that but i think that he has like mug inside not inside now a bunch of little knots inside lugs and in all different directions look at those orange hairs all those trichomes what a beauty beautiful whoa here's one nog they're a bunch of little nugs like they're dense too they're they're pretty dense i wonder how much one you know what let's not wander this really find out let's actually find out how much is one this like this this is this this is a small knot but it's go oh whoa whoa boy where are you going let's put this that's a gram point nine or a gram basically wow oh it has a really good smell it has like a sweet smell to it like almost grapey you can smell the terpenes i mean it's not really strong but you you smell sweetness to it like oh it smells pretty good oh this reminds me of gorilla grape have you guys ever smoked out or smell that that grape smell to it it looks beautiful you can see the purple oh look at this one look at these terpenes i mean these crystals [Music] and you can see all the purple here too look some of that purple in the leaves see it and and i haven't seen a butt like this where it has different tiny butts inside of the big buds it's a lot of little tails everywhere coming out from all this side so you can you see tail here here here i like the sweet smell that he has it's a dense bud grapey smell i wonder if he's gonna taste like grapes as well or i mean it has this sweet smell it's not pudging it's not too strong it just it has like a like a sweet grape smell to it almost candy let's let's go ahead and break one off well here it is it's gonna have this granules strained it up and as always we're using a clean bow and a new screen so that way we taste the actual kindness instead of resins from whatever so this bowl basically every time i use it i put it in solvent and i cleaned it so that way it's always a clean bowl for reviews on let's get all these orange hairs wow that's a nice crunch to it this train has 20 to sea levels and it will hit you like a train oh man this was claimed to be grown by somehow wired brilliance i mean somehow wire breeders and i think those supernova gardens however the true origin of this train is still a mystery like there's no official origin all right let's see this strain is also good for like stress um it's good for stress anxiety depression oh it smells really good as soon as you start grinding up you start spinning that grapes that derping oh it smells so good it smells like sweet no wonder it's like a good for after dinner it has that that sweet smell to it and that creepy smell oh man stays like grapes oh it says mood too you can definitely taste those terpenes that sweet grapey flavor it just hits you on the way in on the way out some but some strains that i have reviewed before they were like you when you when you breathe them in when you inhale it they don't taste the same as when they're coming out and when they when the smoke is coming out when you is when you really hit the flavor with with me on some strains and this one as soon as i hit it the smoke was on my mouth i started to taste the terpenes and the grape and the sweet flavor i inhaled it and let it out and it was just like tasting it again it was pretty good the third hit in i'm already feeling it i'm already feeling it i'm feeling really relaxed again i'm liking this i'm liking this only three hits didn't took that long to hit me i still say it has like it reminds me so much of gorilla grape because of the smell and the taste of it what i gotta say though i like this string better because i mean gorilla grape what was that i don't know it took like a whole bowl maybe a little bit more for me to start feeling the effect and it didn't last that long at least not on my i mean that was my experience with it this one three hits as you can see the bow is not even completely clunky it's still green all over i just hit it three times on this side and i'm i'm feeling it i'm feeling it right now i'm feeling like really relaxed right now i'm feeling a little giggly but hey that's i don't know i like the flavor smooth going in and out [Music] for hit end i can still taste it i still think the grapes not bad not bad hey you know what i wonder what it tastes out of a joint i say we roll the drink and we find out see how the ash burns see if we get a nice white ash or flavor so far flavor is good the butt the looks are really looking good it looks really nice it has a bunch of orange hairs white crystals all over it's dense it's not dry it has a really good flavor and and now smooth going in smooth going out i don't think this is gonna be enough usually i like to put one gram on my joints so that way to burn evenly and it burns slower because it's tight you know if you if you have a joint you don't roll it well you're going to lose you'll start side tracking or canoeing or even tunneling and um so i like to put one gram and that's gonna do it so we're gonna take this one now that's a half a gram there so you see and we're just gonna see if this yep that'll do that'll do i like to put filters in my joint so that way when i'm smoking the cannabis i don't eat it when i'm inhaling it i'm actually smoking i like to cut my paper too as you can see i did a fold here so like that i'm just gonna cut it off the less paper the more canvas i can taste i don't know it's just me it's probably not even true though but that's how i feel so like i take as much papers i can't i use i use raw blacks raw blacks it is so good because like ultra thin paper they're almost transparent of how thin it is and they're watermark so they burn evenly so you really taste what you're smoking with regular rolling papers if they're not thin enough you start tasting like burnt paper i don't like burnt paper so with this super ultra thin paper then watermark even smooth burn and more taste of cannabis than paper here we go so you see that filter now i won't eat the canvas because it's being hold back like a filter nice tight joint and you can you can actually see the canvas through the paper that's how thin it is so you can see it through the paper if this thing won't actually well take my word for it you can actually taste it on a joint too i like it i like how it's good smooth burning nice white ash this part in there [Music] even burning you can see the ring of resins forming around the joint actually yeah i feel like it's a lot smoother in a joint than it is on the boat like in the bose smooth but this right now is like super smooth i'm feeling so relaxed right now i feel good he already hit me like i'm already high i mean why could you expect 20 percent you know this is disturbing is between 20 and 23 percent but this particular batch was 20 percent seriously okay so i finished the joint and it burned smoothly it tasted good it was no problem but here's the problem that i got with this strain it's only been 17 minutes and i'm sober i'm like i haven't smoked nothing and that's not fair that's not good this is the first train that i reviewed that the effect doesn't last as long any other strain that i have reviewed before this minimum of a minimum of an hour then the effects start wearing off after an hour and and it i mean starts wearing off not like it completely improved you know it starts wearing off about an hour so i still continue to feel the effects for over an hour with this one 70 minutes into it after i smoked a bowl completely so it was a gram on a gram and a joint i don't know how much you can put on the boat but you know a bowl is worth and i feel like i haven't smoked that is terrible purple punch my ass i don't see the punch this is that punch line uh-huh i see what i did there i'm sorry that's what happens when i'm sober i get this lame ass jokes i'm just gonna keep on smoking this but you know so to end the video and wrist and to resume the whole thing it okay so it looked good because the butt looks really good it was real cured it had purple all over nice dry columns it smelled really good okay it tastes like smell smells like sweet grapes and um when you smoke a joint with it it burns right you know it's really smooth but when it goes down to the eye it will hit you fast and it will go as fast as it hit you so like three hits in and i was already like oh i was already fitting four hits in so it hits you fast but as fast it hits you that's how fast it goes away because in 17 minutes later here i am smoking water so i mean based on that if they have to give it leaves i'll give it a six leaves and that's because you look good and smell good and taste good but to me the effect is what matters not the looks so yeah six leaves and i'm gonna leave it with that guys because i'm gonna start with another bowl and start working my next review hopefully the next part is gonna be better than this we'll see what happens i'll see you guys in the next one don't forget guys i'm streaming on twitch twitch.tv slash lurk city i'll play games and do the same thing just get stoned and play games with viewers so if you guys on twitch find me there let's play

actually three it has three parents Durban poison let me see skunk number one and haze so it has three okay I don't have the flower a bud or anything to show you today because I actually bought it as a pre-roll okay so here's a story going into the dispensary because I was all out of Harley's ooh and if you know Harley's who is my preferred method that and Charlotte's Web both because they're high CBD and low THC but when I do reviews I do reviews over everything okay but the young lady and the dispensary her name is Jasmine Jasmine said hey yeah we have this one called power Africa and power Africa does is pretty high on the THC spectrum but it does have some CBD in it so you might like it you know and it's sativa dominant because the other two that I got were both indicas so Harley is an indica and she also recommended critical mass which I had not tried yet I'm kind of scared too after this one but those are both indicas and so she said this is sativa again power Africa is sativa dominant and she said it it has you know a suit you maybe good amount of CBD in it and you might like it you know Cena's house is sativa okay so okay just okay so they did not have it in flower and you will find that at a lot of dispensaries they will have they all have different things you know some carry the same type flowers some don't so the dispensary that I go to does not carry Charlotte's Web but they do carry the Harley zoo and actually Holly sue is one I prefer over so it's wet so on that at the dispensary and they didn't have it in in the flower but they did have it in pre-roll and so she said it's a great way to try it and this is another hint that I'm gonna show you guys because I use I use my vaporizer and when I use my vaporizer it's really easy if you have a pre-roll to just you know unscrew it you know open it up and put some in here you know it's already brown and everything it's ready to go right so um so there's that so I don't have let's show you but I didn't use my pre-roll now power Africa Institute the dominant three parents I went online to check as far as to see what the THC levels were there anywhere between 15 and 23 percent is what it says CBD is one percent and up so not significantly high in CBD not not what I would use usually use myself but this was a recommendation so I took it she was great you know she seemed very knowledgeable when it comes to power Africa it's windy you may not see it when it comes to Part F but the one thing that I noticed right off the bat is the aroma when I open it up it was not quite strong yeah no really great you know it smell to it really great aroma to it and when you start reading about aroma is what they're gonna say they're gonna say is sweet and you get fit a lot spicy or Bhatia's floral peppery there's a little bit spicy but the flavor of it I have to say this is probably the best bird I've ever smoked just before 9 the best one what's not dang it was not pungent it was very smooth you know it there was no burning there it was the smoothest most enjoyable smoke or well abate that I ever had and I was like wow this is amazing and it was like a fine wine it was absolutely incredible so I'm sitting there and I you know do a couple of puffs on it because with the one thing that I read was as far as newbies go this is not wine that a newbie should try now when I talk about my advice for newbies why don't you puffs just just to see how it's gonna do you on any string because when it comes to strains I found that what works for me I mean I work for somebody else and what somebody else recommends doesn't always work for me so again always in the beginning try it one or two just to see how you feel how I mix your body feel but I love the aroma of it I love it the taste of it it was sweet it was just a little bit peppery wasn't [ __ ] it was a pungent it wasn't dang it was just absolutely wonderful by the time I got into the house I was baked I mean seriously I was come on I was talking to I have an older son he's almost 25 and he knows what you know what I'm doing I was talking to him trying to tell him wow this is really nice and I just could not stop laughing I couldn't I couldn't keep it together I was having trouble with my words it was it was really interesting in the very beginning and so I get what they say about it being I mean it it really hits you and it really hit me this is the first one that I can say just hit me like minutes in it hit me and I have to say I was done for the rest of I was baited for the rest of the day I had to go upstairs I had to sit down and I was done this one had me like the life other lady I was like it's done so when I say that this is a really strong this was some strong weed is what strong it was a strongest that I've ever had I've never been this hot before and I kept thinking to myself like jasmine really I don't even know if I Melissa to you anymore jasmine I just don't I just can't remember I kept saying jazz but I all you know why I listened to you it was that much of a ride I have to say that if I had to do it all over again this would be luck that one hitter and done seriously I really think because I don't know if I will you try this one again that's how they're not done I was I can see when they stretch them all medical benefits they said it's good for anxiety I get that I really do there's also good for just getting you just baked and done you know you just want to get high this will get you there quickly and this was one of those so side effects yeah relaxing calming after this was a you know ride for me so relaxing calming sedative effects yes yes sir okay but it was the best one I've ever had and I have to reconcile that with the fact that I was so damn high and I talk about this all the time I don't do this for the hire do this for the pain relief the anti-inflammatory effects so that's why I tend to go for a high CBD low THC because she recommended this when I said it was high in CBD is he only you know the reason why I bought it I do reviews but I'm I tend to be more careful on those I don't you know continue to smoke it it's one or two puffs to see what the flavor is like see what the Romans like to get an idea of it I have to admit that I went a little heavy on this one because she said it was higher in CVG I have to think that this was hard and THC then it actually says 15 to 23 percent no I think it was harder than that online you really can't find a lot of information about this one just very basic about power Africa what I smoked it again I just took you saw me taking blood one puff that would be the extent of that as far as it for the CBD effect I won't be doing it for that I'm gonna stick to what I know but if you want to get baked I mean seriously get baked this will get you there and get you there quickly so again one of the best ones though me and if I could find one like this with high CBD and the flavor in there wrong with this one I would be all over it all over it because it was amazing absolutely amazing but again power Africa have the bud to show you absolutely great the the Roma of it is fantastic the taste of it was fantastic I recommend it if you want to get baked for the CBD effects I don't know if I just wasn't feeling any pain because I was so hot away but as far as the ROM and everything is fantastic yeah again power Africa now is it I hope what talk to you guys later [Music] you [Music]", "qwxhQ5cJ0l8": "what's up y'all this your boy Shelton again with another five video brought to you by waking

know I've got everything I need here so it's not too too bad one thing you definitely need those you need some decent weed and right now I am showing off some of these products from Josh hush cannabis club calm you just go to that website and they have such a variety of different things on there that and it's great because it just delivers right to your door or to your post office so and in times like this where essential services are being cut off or not being cut off cannabis is kind of on that fine line you know a lot of people don't think it's a an essential service which may be fair enough but I'm sure there are people that you know genuinely need it for medical things but we are also getting into growing the seasons so a couple things a couple things are okay there okay so right now I have this it is Afghan Kush this is a high level indica indica dominant strain has a little bit of sativa in there but cush as you may or may not know is one of the more kind of like there's no one like pink Kush is no one to be quite potent stuff same goes for this Afghan Kush this is one of the original strains of cush out there mmm okay this is what it looks like nice bud on there it's a little bit fluffy but it's also really sticky like this in your fingers already I can feel it sticking really nice smell there's light kind of floral notes to it a little bit lemony a little like a white pepper kind of a smell to it almost has like a banana pepper kind of vinegar enos to it it's really nice so I'm gonna grind this guy up and see where it takes us again I've tried I've tried these products a few times now I've this was 3.5 grams and now I'm down to this last bud but I've really enjoyed it this is a day well I'm on the third week of quarantine here which I know hopefully all you guys out there taking the appropriate measures and if you're you don't have to work then hopefully you don't have to go out or if you're working from home and hopefully you don't have to go out too much I know for myself I'm fortunate because I'm basically being waited on hand and foot here because I I met at my parents backyard but and that's because I came back from my my Southeast Asia trip that I was on about three and a half months early and so my home has been rented out and now that there's a renters freeze and you basically you can't kick anyone out which is fine I agree to that so that's okay everyone needs a place to live but that's why I'm here currently but it's not too too bad as far as I'm concerned as long as you guys stay on your property or away from other people then we're good okay Oh once this stuff some busted up a little bit you can smell how like oily and dense and and mmm pungent this one is really nice okay in a row a little joint here I've you may have noticed I've switched to zigzag Silver's and they just look cool there there's they're thinner than the whites which I normally use but I'm getting used to it I like it okay let's try this one out so I want to say thank you to all the new subscribers that we have pumping in right now because I guess it's it's April so of 2020 and you know it's starting to get to be around growing season so hopefully there's a lot of people out there looking at some of the grow videos I have a lot of updates on those videos and hopefully I'll be doing some growing from seed videos coming up soon so okay here we go [Music] it tastes nice and fruity already a little bit earthy very like that white pepper smell on when it's freshly ground up is on the on the palate you could say mmm these ones are very potent in the 25 to 27 THC range but also there's there's higher levels of CBD and some of these products from from hash because they primarily focus on a lot of the indica dominant strains um this one tastes delicious sometimes you you find different strains that smell so beautiful this is one of them if you can get yourself some Afghan Kush I highly suggest it it's a classic basically you know it's kind of like pink cush is a classic these are that the go-to blueberry another classic so again couple puffs should do the trick let it settle in I can usually feel I don't know about you guys but I can usually feel it after one or two puffs and and it kind of is a good gauge of where you are but there are like some people call them creeper creeper weed where you don't feel it for like maybe 10-15 minutes and so people like that it's not working and they smoke a [ __ ] ton of it and all of a sudden they're too stoned for their own good and I gotta say there aren't you know when you're first starting to smoke pot you you're not as used to it or accustomed to it so it's you don't want to have a bad experience by getting too stoned I know that definitely happens for people so again go slow take it easy thank you for joining me this stuff's really good it's really good for creativity and I say that with all of them but that's kind of just what pot does for me personally it's this one also kind of makes me a little bit and a little bit speedy in the sense that it is an indica and it should be mellow but I do get a little bit I don't want to say hyper it's not the right word but I think people who smoke pot know what I mean when it's got a little bit of a sativa edge to things it makes you you know start something without finishing it most like starting a painting or starting your dishes or writing a song or making a coffee and you forget to drink it all that kind of stuff it's this this one does that to me for sure anyways you guys thanks for joining me my name is bud click like subscribe and we will see you very soon thanks again stay safe out there [Music]", "takXFRswrCM": "boom went back rollers only cold we got a morning session wake and bake today I'm super excited you got peanut butter breath from rugged roots let's get after it you know what to do five categories visual smell Care taste effect break it down one to ten add them all up at the end boom there's your final squad this is all just my opinion I'm an idiot not a [ __ ] expert but I'm just like one of everyone of you guys go to dispensary I buy weed I figure it out I see what's good I see what's bad I let you know it is what it is so today we got peanut butter breath from rugged roots super indica heavy high terpenes are crazy they got this real nutty florally terpenes to it it's earthy it's nutty has like a little Florrick has a little peppery has a little citrusy so first we got visual and I'm looking at a very rugged roots-type bud right a lot of their buzz very dense very pretty they got dark tones they got light tones sugar throughout the whole thing and the red hands are just covering the bud it's crazy definitely definitely a top-notch flower I'm gonna have to go 1/8 on the visual a ton a visual it's a solid solid visual bud it's got the colors it's got the sugar it's got the red hairs let's move on to care oh yeah with the cure the buds are dense they got nice bounce to them when you squeeze them but they're dense as [ __ ] I don't snap this [ __ ] let's get a smell oh yeah it's like it's trapped like that smell is sweet but it's like trapped inside the buds when you crack that you know that care it's right when you crack the bone it's just like playbook boom smelling your face the Cure is amazing rugger roots they always cure their stuff very very well I'm gonna have to go a tonic air let's get back to smell terpenes are attacking my nose that's beautiful smell I do like the complexity of the smell I like how there's multiple layers to the smell I am actually gonna go hit this smell what a nine because it's unique it's complex it's not just citrus it's not just earthy it has like a multiple tone to it I really really really am intrigued by it really an imagery all right we got taste we got peanut butter breath from rugged roots Cheers it's not a very nutty very earthly that citrusy I think just leaves when it comes to taste I think that citrusy smell does not I'm doing the taste at all but it is very nutty it is very earthy and I think it has like a little pepper a little pepper peppery the enemy into it I'm gonna have to go I would have liked to that citrus just stayed there for like just a little hint of it completely leaves so I'm gonna have to go with a seven on the taste all right effect now I gave it a second to let it kick in and I'm gonna go this is a heavy indica super relaxing super euphoria heavy heavy on the eyes definitely just woke up and smoked the heavy indica probably gonna take a morning nap right out this this is a nighttime smoke this is a had a long day take a shower fresh out the shower time to spark up and chill for the night design going nowhere type of week I'm gonna give it a solid eight on effect it does everything you needed to do you know rugged boots they always perform always perform this is what was only like a subscribe new strain review every Thursday at 4:20 it's going down this year I want to get 52 strains in this year for 52 weeks in the year maybe we do a couple bonus strains who knows let's get it like subscribe thanks for watching peace I'm

activist in an epic on-air resignation she said [ __ ] it I quit this is such a beautiful time for me to just talk about marijuana I think that was ktva television so many of you are pro-marijuana but you're not pro black how's this black woman gonna be pro-marijuana but not pro black she quit her job over to smoke weed to smoke marijuana a plan but she won't put a job over Mike Brown snap she won't quit her job over black nationals in the black Nationals and issues these people that are about the prohibition of weed and they say they support weed in love marijuana more than they love they own black people black race they love getting high more than as they love they are raised any own people and wanting to smoke marijuana is a good enough reason to quit your damn job now i agree people have a right to smoke weed if they want to I think that it should be decriminalized I think that people should be able to do most of whatever the hell they really want to do without being under the rules laws and regulations of white supremacy so I'm not saying that all she should you know not be able to put weed in all this and it's illegal and all I'm not making that type of an argument about marijuana because I don't support any of the legal system period but i don't think the prohibition of marijuana addresses the real issue of racial profiling and why black people are being arrested and locked up and just because you legalize marijuana doesn't mean it is that racism white supremacy is going to go away and they try to merge those two issues together and it'll in order to win us over to crack us to the prohibition of marijuana they try to use racism in it and try to throw in the numbers of how many black people are going to jail based on marijuana indictments they make that relevant to why marijuana need to be made legal they don't care none about black nationalism and the freedom and liberties of black people they just they just care how they can use the argument of marijuana in order to to bring white people to draw white people into that argument to add momentum that they marijuana prohibition argument I think we need to get to work in white supremacy altogether the white supremacy counter we need to counter white supremacy police terrorism get rid of the police department and white supremacist surgeons in black communities we need to run our own communities period not just legalize marijuana legalized everything legalize getting your ass up the hell up out about goddamn communities period but on the marijuana issue on the marijuana issue you cannot put marijuana as it is a significant issue above like nationalism we should be some type of Europe you hypocrite is like putting gay rights over black nationalism it's like gay rights movement marijuana prohibition movement is like animal rights activism but none of these people have to courage and hard to say i'm told Blake I'm a black nationalist but I'm pro at all I'm pull animal rights I'm throw a plant right I'm put all my sexuality but none of them will say I'm pro black I have a problem with that now this news reporter quitting a job great and how hopefully marijuana gave us an epiphany to help her move towards greater self sufficiency to not be under the white man and all hopefully but black nationalism is more important black power is more important than the prohibition of marijuana the issue with marijuana let me go to spiritual issue that i have with marijuana people gonna smoke a marijuana nose like I said you shouldn't go to jail because you got some marijuana and all that'd be on the white men all that the marijuana but let's deal with marijuana for a second you talk about you organic you're vegan you don't do with GMO genetically modified foods marijuana is a genetically modified food marijuana is GMO before the white man even got started pushing his GMO movement Monsanto we've been pushing our own GMO movement for a hell of a long time with marijuana it's a genetically modified plant where the way it is grown you take all the mills and kill them and you keep the females right the marijuana is essentially a female plant we talk about the effeminate a shin of the black man and we talked about how much marijuana we smoke all the marijuana we smokin is contributing to the intimidation it's a female plan it's a genetically modified plan and just like you kill all the male plants with marijuana and just raise the female plants the same you do in society it's metaphysical you take all the black men and lock them up separate them from the women so they won't pollinate right you kill off all the males and just keep the women that's what the marijuana plant is so you think you say you are what you eat if you eat a plant with the Karma that has that all the males have been killed off all the males have been separated from the females and that's the plan that you invest what the hell you think your life gonna look like why do you think we smoked so much marijuana in our communities and we have single woman households the male leave the woman and the woman is left to ourselves with the children just like the marijuana plant you are what the [ __ ] you eat this is a reality you are what you ingest so quit talking about you'll just genetically modified foods and you all organic and all that and you were smoking and inhaling a genetically modified plants and the quality of the marijuana it's based on its genetic modification I hope you hear what I'm born with that so if you won't be you're gonna totally give up GMO you're going to have to stop smoking weed and you wanted to take into consideration that no animal in nature smokes anything the realities from smoke he'd gone the other you have to train a gorilla out of smoke we learn how to smoke anything from the white man we got that from the crackers smoking we wasn't smoking nothing before the cracker came say the Native Americans were smoking a little to back off maybe what you call the Native American is enlightenment is a different type of a white man if you ask me a true native americans were the Moors the blackamoors the Maroons the Blackfoot Indians Seminoles the Washita which you call the Native American that you did you cry for on columbus day I logical um today on Thanksgiving you cry for that's the white man that you're talking about that's who stole your true native history of America that so-called goddamn Native American that's our history we are the truth natives ain't no pale man the native of any goddamn thing we got smoking for normal give it back we don't need to smoke a damn thing and it particularly not genetically modified plant native americans smoke sage and tobacco grown naturally you smoke in a plan that has been genetically modified over time so the black with the marijuana thing okay she quit her job excellent excellent she quit over marijuana disappointing so now she can go wherever she is and smoke some marijuana with some goddamn white hippy proud to be everything but black proud to be everything but black we're going to get persecuted for being black they don't stop and say well you just got marijuana more black people are getting locked up with marijuana then white people are you're getting prosecuted for being black and you're not proud of that you're proud of being a part of marijuana Association hell no", "93PpBB54wuU": "hi my name is Alexa Cipriano and my informative speeches on medical marijuana and why it's a better alternative medicine to take them prescription medicine so when you hear the word marijuana do you think of it as a joke or do you think of it as medicine marijuana has been used as medicine since the beginning of time but not everybody saw marijuana as a medicine they saw it as a party drug or gateway to escape from reality marijuana is an all-natural plant that contains two active ingredients CBD and THC medical marijuana is not only for smoking but it comes in different forms as pills oils and now being used in certain food dishes medical marijuana and prescription medicine have something in common which are trying to help people who are suffering from pain and illnesses but as for prescription medicine it's a compound substance as for medical marijuana it's an all-natural plant medical marijuana is a better alternative medicine to take because it's all-natural fewer side effects and it's less addictive than pain medication medical marijuana is an unnatural plant which contains cannabinoids cannabinoids are found in a flower of the plant and within those flowers of the plant within the cannabinoids they photos two active ingredients THC and CBD THC increases your appetite helped if you're suffering from pain and information well as CBD helps people who are have mental disorders suffering from seizures and people who are highly addicted to pain medication the FDA doesn't approve nor disapprove medical marijuana because marijuana there's no proper dosing but if people who chooses to take medical marijuana can go to their local dispensaries and they will weigh out the marijuana in two ounces or grams medical marijuana side effects or a little list which are headaches dry eyes and mouth paranoia and the lack of motor skills so marijuana is not recommended if you are going to be moving a motor vehicle but if you were taking prescription medicine it's a long list of side effects that are in fine print and you don't really know what it's actually gonna cause and the doctors may say oh it's gonna just causing headaches vomiting diarrhea but who really knows because if they're all in fine print and as for taking prescription medicine you don't really know what you're putting into your body it could be anything because we're not pharmacists we just want a medicine that's going to help us that's why a marijuana isn't not your kind you know what you're putting into your body which is a plant that comes from the earth well Medical Marijuana is the safer and reliable medicine to take because it's all-natural and you know what you're putting in to your body and there's only a little side effects to it while it's prescription medicine it's a long list of side effects that you don't even know medical marijuana is the way to go if you're trying to find a medicine with less side effects according to the Betty Ford the Hazelton Betty Ford rehabilitation center they stated that medical marijuana is not as addictive to prescription medicine if you are addicted to medical marijuana you are calmly taking a THC of marijuana but there's the alternative of medical marijuana which is the CBD products CBD helps with pain to pain mental disorders seizures and if you highly addictive to anything not just pain medications or th the products of medical marijuana but CBD will always help because they're legal around the United States and they're not only for smoking either they come in pillows now gummy bears lotions and patches if you are highly addictive you can always take the CBD products which is gonna help you and it's all natural and we have those located in basically any store nowadays therefore medical marijuana is a safer way to go because it's an all-natural product in fewer side-effects and it's not as addictive to pain medications comparing prescription medicines and medical marijuana medicines which would you choose a compound substance or in our natural plan in my opinion marijuana is the safest way if you are suffering from any pain or illnesses you should really try taking medical marijuana thank you so much for watching my video I hope you really enjoyed it thank you", "fwzdHjjsZGs": "[Music] [Applause] Acapulco gold genetics real Mexican land race was able to finally pick this up at my shop it came in just a couple days ago I had to snag it to do a review for you guys first off I just wanted to say it has amazing beautiful orange hairs trichomes all deep throughout in the roots and the stems very very dense solid nugs light green you can tell it's a solid sativa the farm that I was buying it through there's gonna be pioneer nuggets and you can see that they teamed up with leafy and gives you everything you need to know about this strain but this is one of my favorites to tea the strains I've had it a couple times I've been waiting to get a real a real Acapulco gold strain and it's hard to get Mexican genetics in Nepal too but I'm glad that I came and I had to pick it up I must achieve a smoker I know I do a lot of city reviews and that's only because there's more time in the day I will be doing indica reviews I will be doing oil reviews but um right now this is just kind of like the time that I have the time frame so I'm doing more sativas I will mix it up though but um the smell of this whoo when I first smelled it and opened it up it was very very sweet and piney I had a very nice almost like a lemon kick to it I can tell just by smelling it that it's a very very nice sativa it still has that donkey kick to it you can smell the soil that it's been grown in it's phenomenal we grinded some up right here and you can kind of see got that nice light green hue to it [ __ ] zoom in and get a focus on for like the nugs you can see the orange hairs got this bad boy this doesn't seem to want to focus very well but oh well you can see that it's it's frosty it's orange it's beautiful its it's amazing but yep it's nice I was gonna go ahead and grind some of this up do some bong rips for you guys you guys just to break down it kind of how it makes me feel out it tastes you know about and kind of talk to you guys all right let's do some reps and get to it today's been a pretty good day I just got done hitting the trail with my wife we are longboarding has a day off today so I figure today every day for tibideaux some more pretty nuts but at the diner Tyson is dakatoka role that we finally got it she was amazing beautiful day it's gonna be to be nice to smoke or something probably then my dog Titus I'm a walking just enjoy it outside because I know that the last couple times I've had this train it's been very energetic and like creative and just even today it's gonna be good it's just got a nice sweet hiding piney flavor to it it's amazing I can't try it it was do these super smooth super sweet super soon you can definitely taste the soil that they're using equals I believe they have it honestly doesn't give a list for a pesticide so I'm thinking that this is more of a natural form but then again I'm not too sure it tastes like it is it doesn't give anything lots of double-checking that and get back to you there are some other strains that these guys have like lottie dottie they have some blueberry silver cups and I'm gonna be doing some of these arms they're phenomenal I'll get some more information on these guys but from what the taste in this case is just like like Cascadia they don't have any burn to it and harshness to it it's like I don't get a chemical kick to I get to pull earthy sweet real soil tickets it's good stuff the second hit almost kind of taste harmony not time to not kind of like an OG fish farm or town is more severe Carlos I got as a lemony caramel but it's nice to be able to just take really really decent-sized long ribs without any harsh burner kick to it I can see they're just smoked in one after another because there's no Lerner cake whatsoever I'm enjoying it a lot it's nice to finally get us Fatima that I can grind out throw in a bowl and sit there and rip and it's not gonna be super harsh and it has a lot of good flavor to it's hard to find a nice quality sativa at the flavor laughs after the second hit which I'm gonna take you to it that's my third in the flavors not really all out there it's still got a nice way to get to it but a lot of the times the city voters don't have a long without the although I've ripped this down pretty low the flavors still there is nice and it's potent you I feel it already I'm starting to get kind of like to leave my senses your motivating it's definitely a head change I can feel it behind the eyes death you know the events of us going on not quite so read roll head change like train wreck but more kind of hazy like heavy behind the eyes kind of feel a little heavy but still feel really good [Music] another thing that I'm feeling - that's nice is I'm not feeling any light anxiety - your paranoia and I know that like throughout the day I gotta do a lot of stuff everywhere grocery store divert get things done and I get super bad anxiety when I go out and do stuff for you know when I'm driving and I'm not saying I can't drive or anything I'm just saying there's an example there's a lot of stuff that goes on but I don't feel comfortable doing and it's nice to get that mental ahead change without any paranoia so it usually it comes on really quick for me but I don't have me in the slightest I'm ready to go do some stuff let me go ahead and finish this here real quick we got like that stated in my previous videos right now I'm currently a budtender and when I come around working with cannabis for quite a while now about seven years into because from the medical part of the part that here at Washington State and I just love being able to help people I love being able to give them the right string for whatever it is that you're looking for they need help I don't believe we're its friends and family members that have been stuck on prescription pills their whole life and whether it be CVD or THC but seen a drastic change and it's just amazing to finally see it working in people changing their minds yeah it's just done I know it comes out of a pretty good background with it so I helped you me personally a few honest any person with so much just for migraines to see the problems and that's kind of like why I'm making this channel I make these videos is whether you just like to sit and watch

up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing colombian gold by potent planet i have been trying to get my hands on this ganja for a minute to review for you guys so since colombian gold is a brand new strand of the channel let's go ahead and talk about it this strain originated in the santa marta mountains of columbia and the parent genetics come from the strain south american now this is a sativa strain that parented one of the most popular strains of all time skunk number one and as you guys know skunk number one has gone on to become the parent genetics of countless other strains of cannabis so this is some old school genetics in this colombian gold you guys so before we get into this review i'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys to check it out and then we're gonna take a look at it together okay so you guys just had a chance to check this stuff out let me know what you guys think in the comments below here so let's go ahead and you guys i like these nice little jars they've got the twist tops on here and man these turps are strong it's that lemony or lemon flavor you guys so like pine salt flavor and it's funny i'm actually not a big fan of these terps like for me these are my personal least favorite terps that i know this was a lemony strain i probably should have because there's lemons all over this stuff um i probably wouldn't got it to be honest just because i'm not a fan of the lemon but i know a lot of you guys are and you like these terps so it's good that we're still reviewing this strain but um yeah i'd say the terps are popping in this you guys honestly like this is how wheat is supposed to smell it big ups to the guys at potent planet you have delivered some terpenes we like to see that good start good start so let's go ahead and take a look at this stuff and see what it's all about here so really nice nugs you guys honestly these aren't like small little baby nugs either so let me try to get out of the way here for half a second i'm gonna see if i can let's see if this zooms in on this bud while i remove myself so here it is you guys so i'll tell you this stuff is really light green like really light green and some of these bright green hairs or excuse me leaves poking out that have just been trimmed right up to the bud they did a great job trimming this stuff it's covered in terpenes and these light orange or peach colored hairs like i'll say the peach colored hairs honestly are like really great proportions and it's funny it's got that lemon smell but there's something a little unique to this like it's not the typical like it is but it's not there's a subtle sweetness there that's kind of making this a little bit different and unique so i really do um again stand by the fact that like these aren't my favorite turf but i will say that like these turfs are popping here you guys so yeah i honestly and even like from the looks perspective like it's really covered in crystals it's good looking butt it's not the best looking bud we've ever seen by any means but it is really good-looking bud and they manicured this so well you guys so i'm so excited to try this out because honestly i have been trying to snake this potent planet for so long it seems like when it hits the shelves here it's just gone immediately and i mean listen at 50 bucks in eighth you guys you know closer to 55 after tax it's like this i'm expecting to be some really good good dank in that private reserve or private selection section um of the cannabis varieties you know you've got that loads here the mid tier the high tier and then that private reserve so today i'm going to be enjoying this columbian gold from potent planet out of my arizer extreme q desktop vaporizer i've got it set to 375 degrees fahrenheit there here is the brand new cyclone bowl that look it just not even hot i can touch it because it's got this awesome silicone casing on it and then i'm going straight from the air riser extreme desktop vape which my mail end is going in you guys see that has just been perfectly cleaned out a little hair stuck to there look like a little doggie here um so anyways you guys i'm gonna put that one into the vape and then this other end here that's got a built-in screen i just picked that up from arizer and that end is going to be going into my you guys know what's coming scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler we got that nice wizard on the front the first chamber here you guys i've left that empty that's where carbon would typically go that would catch ash that would get caught in this water but the second chamber which is the purified water and obviously you guys see this has just been cleaned out i've left this empty because there is no ash that will be getting in to the water since we're vaporizing this today and then my third and final chamber there i've just got an organic cotton filter to filter out any remaining impurities from this bud so if you guys have your pieces ready i've got mine ready and they're all fights my piece is fired up so i want you guys to fire up yours let's do this together and get down and let's see what this colombian goal where is it there we go by potent planet is all about okay so not the smallest first rip you guys like i actually got excuse me a decent sized rip there that lemon flavor i was telling you guys about that i smelled even though that was a subtle rip it's pretty much completely engrossing my mouth right now i'm going to dive in for the second rip and i want to see if that flavor just coats my mouth because boy if so these terps are poppin all right wow that was a really decent sized rip and you guys if you like lemon terps this bud's got it i mean wow that flavor is just completely covering my mouth um and it does it has a little bit of sweetness there in it like so it's got that citrus way like i would say 90 and maybe 10 to 5 5 to 10 it's like something unique that it makes this you know not pure lemon so it is very an interesting flavor um but i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna finish puffing out this bowl but while i'm doing that i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff so here it comes now all right so here is the columbian gold by potent planet and oh my gosh is this stuff just covered in terps you guys can see just bright orange hairs perfectly interwoven throughout this bud honestly the proportions of crystals to hairs in my opinion are damn near perfect in those bright bright neon leaves just poking out of this bud that have just been trimmed right up to the bud so what a great trim job on this and again i mean just absolutely as frosty as it gets and really really great looking bud under the macro lens okay so you guys just had a chance to check this stuff out what did you guys think of this stuff under the macro lens you guys i mean to me i think this is some really well grown product you guys saw i mean those leaves trimmed right up to the bud i know they didn't run this through an auto trimmer honestly and you know you guys it's like there was just a great proportion of crystals to hairs those terps were not like absolutely ginormous but they were covering this plant and honestly this was some really good looking stuff now um the effects i mean i'm feeling absolutely like sativa effects that is like 100 one thing that i'm gonna say about this is like this is a sativa through and through like i wouldn't even put this in the hybrid category this is a sativa if you are looking for up i need to go my my mind is like racing in a thousand directions i don't even know like there's no reason for it to be racing right now in any sort of direction so anyways you guys like as it stands right now for me this is putting on full-blown sativa effect if you are into sativas great if you're not that's fine too but what i want to do now is i want to talk about the final rating on this columbian gold i rate all of these strains out of 10. i break those down the 10 into four different categories the look the smell the taste and the potency or how effective this medicine is so each of those four different categories can earn up to 2.5 points each hopefully adding up to the full 10 points in this so what i'm going to do is i want to talk about the looks first so i'm going to bring it up on the screen for you guys one more time and i'll give you guys my final rating on all of those four different categories and my final overall rating for this columbian goal by potent planet okay you guys so you guys just had a chance to see it and you've seen it now a few different times let's talk about the looks so in the looks category you guys for me i am going to go ahead out of 2.5 and i want to give this stuff a 2.0 you guys i think it's good it's not great it's beautiful bud but it's not like the best looking butt we've ever seen by any means i mean again it's good it's absolutely good and you know there's nothing i'm like gonna be like there's not really much wrong with it but i've seen better looking bud in my personal opinion so i'm going to give it a 2 in the looks category the smell though that's where this stuff wins you guys now i have to be fair about this and i'm going to give it a 2.5 out of 2.5 even though i don't like these lemon turps for me if i smelt this i would give it a zero out of 2.5 truthfully and i would say i don't want this and i would ask the buntender to get something different you know with covid going on all this stuff you can't smell these strains we don't know what we're getting a lot of the times and again i'm just not into the lemon terps but i'm still gonna give this a 2.5 out of 2.5 this stuff is banging you open this jar and it's like oh [ __ ] or if i had this in a single bag and i got pulled over a cop would be like hey where's your medical marijuana card you know so the bottom line is for this stuff you guys i'm gonna give it a 2.5 because it is it's loud this is very very like whoa oh my god holy cow that is strong it's not my favorite but i know some of you guys love these lemon terps so the taste i'm gonna give it a two it's like it was very very smooth and the lemon terps definitely popped through but like to me i don't think this lemon is like this is just a gin it's a generic flavor to me like a 2.5 is something like really unique very very special and it's just like again coating your mouth like and this was really really good but it's like it wasn't like it was good it wasn't great or outstanding or anything like that even from the lemon side of things you guys so it's like it was good um 2.0 out of 2.5 that's amazing you guys and then a potency i'm gonna give it a two out of two point five because it is it's just a full blown um you know a full-blown sativa even for a sativa i'm not sure that it's the absolute most potent that i've ever had or anything like that um and i'm just trying to compare it to other potent you know sativa strains it is very potent for sure but it's not probably the most potent i've ever had so like a two point uh 2.0 in the potency category and if you guys have been adding that up that's a two in the loads category a 2.5 in the smell category 2.0 in the taste category and a 2.0 the potency category that's an 8.5 for this stuff you guys and you know again just because i'm not into the lemon turps like i wouldn't cop this stuff again i personally would not for 50 bucks and i actually i just wouldn't cop it again for anything to be honest they could have been selling this for 10 bucks an eighth and i wouldn't have bought it i just don't like the lemon terps but i know a lot of you guys do and if you're into lemon terps this potent planet stuff is is dang honestly i mean it's it's it's solid stuff um and i would say overall that like you know if you guys like the lemon terps try this potent planet this is clean medicine and this is definitely good good stuff um man i am stoked for potent planet now i've been trying to get my hands on this nose no joke you guys i've been trying to get my hands on a few potent planet screens for like a month month and a half so like this is the first review we've done from them there is definitely going to be more because i'm excited for what's to come from them and um you know seeing what else they have got on decks so with that being said if you guys have tried the colombian gold definitely let me know what you guys think of it in the comments below and if there's something you guys want to see reviewed absolutely also let me know that in the comments below but that's pretty much going to be it for us from for today you guys so 8.5 out of 10 for the colombian gold from potent planet congratulations that is going to get the dank recommendation from canapedia and pick some up if you guys are into sativas and you like those lemon terps but until the next one you guys be good to yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon peace you", "_n6av6HZv5Y": "what's up y'all should boy Nicky aka Nikolai's 420 coming at y'all with another episode of ACEF TV and this one got a Strang review for

"how you doing welcome back to dan's buddha bodega where today we're gonna review a strain from gti and it's called lavender jones so let's just get right to it lavender jones is a well-balanced hybrid from gti uh part of their rhythm brand that crosses purple urkel with casey jones now to be honest i've never even heard of casey jones but purple urkel i've had and it's amazing so i can't wait to see what this has in store for me all right now that you've broken through the packaging the first thing you're going to notice is that there's not too much of a smell but the looks on this flower is amazing the purple urkel just beautifully mixing with that casey jones beautiful purples greens dark greens not too too much keef but you know enough the buds are nice and dense uh not really crispy but you know just really grown with care all right well we've had our look let's go taste this all right guys well without further ado nostrovia cilantro cheers salud [Music] very earthy [Music] yeah early like sticks to be honest that's all i'm really getting is earthy because it's like i just took a big bite out of a pile of leaves well yeah guys that's uh all i can really all i'm really getting is earth and it's a little harsh too ugh well this is isn't my most favorite tasting strain but i can already feel a cerebral head rush coming on so what do you say we give it a few minutes and then i'll come back and discuss the effects all right guys well i've given a little bit of time and let me tell you the effects of lavender jones are amazing if depression had a kryptonite lavender jones would be it it starts off real fast and real heavy with a cerebral head rush that takes it from zero to 200 miles per hour and 0.00001 flat but then as time goes on the purple earth starts to show up and it lulls you into a state of calm euphoria so if you asked me dan how does it make you feel i'd have to say i i feel pretty good i uh i'm not scared at all i kind of kind of feel invincible so if you smoke for depression or anxiety go out and get yourself some lavender jones you will not be disappointed all right guys well that just about does it for me here i'd like to say

most of us think of leafy has the menu page on our favorite dispensaries website which it is but I discovered once i went to leafy calm is a lot more than that and they have some great features and i think you should know about now they offer education and they offer what's trending and you know they offer more information on the strains themselves but i thought one of the most powerful features of leafy calm was the search function so basically if you're looking for a particular strain you just typed that up in the upper right-hand corner here put in your favorite strain and bam up pops where that strain is located what dispensary it is in it offers you know education and it offers insights into the strains and whatnot and kind of what's trending and what's popular and it's got you know a really cool interface now it just done on me but if you think about it leafy calm is basically a giant database of all the strains and all the dispensaries everywhere so we have the perfect opportunity to go ahead and plug in your favorite strain and what leafy does is pops up and it tells you exactly where that strain is if it's available it gives you a direct link to the menu and so if you want to call the dispensary see if they have it in stock and you can go down pick it on up i would recommend kali know before you do something like that because sometimes you know they ran out of stock and you know so be sure to make a phone call before you go down so the next time you're looking for your favorite strain be sure to check out leafy com search feature and hopefully you can get connected with your favorite strain thanks for watching this is Enzo chepa at bud simple calm have a great day", "uU-z46IbzGw": "[Music] what's that wavy fam welcome back to the channel if you guys are new I'm cat I'm trippy and today we're gonna be reviewing Gary Payton buy cookies and powers genetics yeah if you guys haven't heard about coke Gary Payton but to put you guys on it's a new strain that just was released like about a month ago - yeah and this is honestly the second ace we picked up some and we did try it first just because we like to try the weed and see if we like it right yeah before we like even shoe with you guys could lose we want to share the best with you guys yeah yeah we thought this was pretty freakin good so we're gonna let you guys know a little bit about it cheers by the way let the spark up a little nice swing this is a little wake and bake for us right now [Applause] if you guys are watching this in the morning make sure you get a little breakfast a little wake and bake baby eat a [Music] and cut all the smoke so this is a cookies and powered Z collab guys don't know who power diseases it's like a one of the known growers in the barrier it's known for like so why the Sun oh man all the exotics that you guys you know see on Instagram that burner that burner smokes himself yeah so it's a cross of the Y and snowman it's hybrid testing I like about 24% THC it's pretty high ya know CBD in there but it's gonna be more of a calming relaxing effect right kind of right in the middle not too [Music] and the nerves are gonna like look so fruity and color for y'all you're gonna have like a little bit of orange cookie pears in there some purple some [ __ ] crystal like all the time 1/8 like this goes for $80 75 to 80 dollars you guys always ask us what did this go for that's what it goes for out here y'all yeah that's typical I think like at the club's now ever since its recreational before top shops didn't used to be $75 $80 so used to be like $50 60 the most you know none of the things were tested longer we to assess it it was never sent to the lab check for pesticides I think that's the reason why things are more expensive now it's because it take like the companies have to pay a lot for them to get this stuff testing so whenever it does hit the show yeah I just have to be a little bit more expensive because they put a lot of money just to get it onto the show I guess it's like that's worth it you know you're smoking good stuff especially right now a lot of people are just making fake stuff and you know even bad we can even look good like I had an egg on my snap and I told everybody if they will sum up this and everyone's like yeah I'll smoke that just it looks hella good but little did they know that I was holding was like a London money one mug like who didn't know you know like that's not easy it is to get manipulated with the Wii and cards y'all that's why everybody like that why wanna know if before you know so quick to say y'all smokey or you know be like no like before just so quick to smoke things but I feel like not a lot of people know like hi they supposed to know bosz good weed looks like if they never had good weed you know or like if the best weed they had it's like not even I mean like not somebody else like I thought the weed I was getting fired like I was like damn getting some fire ass me and now that I like I know my [ __ ] I'm just saying what the [ __ ] was I smoking and why was I flexing that you know like why did I become so cool I mean it was fire though back then yak when your flood was so you lead and like it came in little baggies yeah and it wasn't like shake or like dried up even was actually like good meg that's crazy how much weed has an balls yeah and that's why prices are the way they are not for like yeah it's just crazy how like that's something like I can't afford a $75 ate every day you know yeah we can't afford that how much is an ounce of that it's like $600 an ounce right all right that's crazy the like just living in San Cisco already is expensive it's like why don't my wheat have to be expensive as well everything food you know you want to eat good food yeah I think every now and then you cheat yourself to be like this yeah you know and then you're gonna get super high but I don't know I feel like it's better to know get it straight from the source I wish I knew powers hit me up because I need to fresh it I don't need this [ __ ] up and sitting in the show for me to buy it that's the Gary Payton I want but this guy paid in this other good so it's good yeah but you know we taste different with this fresh than when it's been having to go get tested and getting the cookie back getting some to different places what about the only you testing they say they do know you can't lie baby let us know if you guys will pay $75 for India yeah in taxes to there's something you know don't forget about taxes [Music] but it takes hella good it's getting me we were hired doing the job we're about to start the day and I don't think it feel tired no for sure I'm loaded I totally took hybrid I like smoking hybrids a lot just because it gives you a mix above I gives me a mix of both and like it still keeps my mind like running I don't know it doesn't like it doesn't shut my brain down like indicas shut my [ __ ] breakdown like once I smoke that I'm like I can't even think anymore [Music] shut up Howard these cookies for making this goods train get it paid in check it out I don't know Gary Payton is it's an NBA player born and raised and I think Oakland but you know shout out the bay you guys can get your hands on it cuz I think it's limited to like the cannabis club I don't know let me know if you guys have tried it you

ramp up my energy for these [ __ ] videos to make them a little more entertaining and without further ado let's get this bread gamers that should taste everything much different than the indoor GMO cookies I had its this has more of like like absolute [ __ ] lemon like a lemon food taste and for experience five heads y'all know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about because it packs a moment like farts I [ __ ] want like welcome with axis I like the outdoor GMOs just the [ __ ] Endor would so despite my kinda general Brodie irritation this is actually quite a pretty straight I think there's one maybe [Music] all right overall I like to [ __ ] yo I think this is some [ __ ] fantastically drawn outdoor flower may be the second best outdoor flower I've ever smoked behind some outdoor dog walker I used to smoke on that was [ __ ] phenomenal I really actually like how this one tastes more that kind of dog [ __ ] lemony taste I prefer that over the indoor Thunder more cookie taste I really like this this it's not as a bracelet which is nice things I got to do my overall review of this little beach I'm actually gonna do a play a 9.2 out of time I thoroughly enjoyed this training thoroughly enjoyed their excuses did I thoroughly enjoy the outdoor now I might almost say I enjoy it more than the Endora I'm not sure yet oh yeah 9 points out of 10 I would recommend this is great for music I would almost say this is a good anytime soon be perfectly honest at least for me it for my firm so I won't be able to keep it in rotation although I was very much like to but that's gonna

comments peace those stay medicated", "Zciy2LxWn1M": "Bammer TV welcome back to Bammer TV weed reviews where we review the best weed around today we have another indica and it is platinum cush so very hyped about this if you guys want to check out some of our other weed reviews we do have a we'd review playlists that you can find in the description without further ado let's get started here's platinum Cooke Platinum Kush is an indica dominant strain that is known for its platinum silvery haze due to its thick layer of crystals on top it has a relatively high THC content and the aromas from this will really knock you out yeah in the buds themselves the silvery color that people are talking about it's kind of the lightness of the green on the bud itself it does have some nice orange hairs it's a really nice read to look at it's very pretty it does grind up pretty nice as well it's very dense it'll definitely fill your grinder so immediately Dave and I went with both as our method of smoking this it just makes a really nice pack medicinally this is gonna be a great body relaxer and stress reliever it's also great for pain management and insomnia if you're having trouble falling asleep this train will help ease your mind into sleeping all right and overall I really like this weed but Dave it is up to you to give the final Bama rating maybe some final thoughts in there too what do you think so as far as platinum cush goes I really enjoy this train a lot it does have a couple of negative effects in one of them being dry eyes I'm very subject to dry eyes another one being cottonmouth which we all know how I feel about cottonmouth but all of those side effects aside I definitely think this is a top of the line strain this is a direct descendant of OG Kush which is the father of all California weed so I really enjoy this a lot I'm give this train 3 and 3/4 out of 5 the dry eyes and cotton mouth were worth it but at the same time I definitely need some Visine right now alright so overall a pretty average score I definitely feel the same way there was some things holding it back the aroma is really nice I liked how the buds felt themselves but I respect your opinion sir but thank you guys very much for watching like we said we have a ton more weed reviews in the description on the screen right now you can go check those out but for everything else weed

flower like this that I have seen yet though I did just scoop some Girl Scout cookies and white buffalo that actually is just as frosty but just as pricey they all came in at 53 dollars an eighth those 3/8 all being 53 dollars an eighth range from total percentages of THC from as low as 19% all the way to 26% they're all just as dense just as frosty just barely smelly not crazy smelly not punching your face deliciously smelly so I truly don't know how other than just pure amounts of trichomes and the density that they've priced their particular eights other than that I have no idea that's truly an assumption because to me the puck yeah coming in at 21 and a half percent THC is just as powerful just as potent just as great as all of those other four and yet it's a 33 dollar eighth I just don't I don't see how they're doing it other than just maybe a dice roll or a guess or some guys just picking and choosing to make these beautiful trichomes on this particular strain they had to take an indica GU berry a hybrid Hel's OG and a sativa Jack the Ripper to cross completely to make this nine pound hammer strain and these beautiful trichomes all over this plant are just evidence of the handiwork that they made at this genetics lab to create this strain when it's ground up is when I actually got notes of a citrus smell at all but before that just sitting in in the 8th container it's not very pungent but it is still a delicious smell but it's more grassy maybe earthy - anything more than citrus or sweet like I've read that it should be or even fruity I believe is somewhat people have said the strain can be as far as medicinally it knocked it out of the park for what I need an indica to do I was able to sleep I felt great all over my body from being sore from boogie boarding and kayaking took that care of all of those problems so I thoroughly enjoyed the strain I felt like it was delicious it smoked very well it was cured very well it ground very well it was everything I needed it to do but again I could love a lower price tag so I do not think I will come back to the 9 pound hammer I'm going to go back and stick with something more affordable like the puck yeah that does just as well and just as much and just doesn't quite have the eye-popping stunning trichomes and dense structure that everyone wants to pay I guess 53 dollars for 1/8 so that is how I feel about the 9 pound from true leave it is great I like it if I were richer I'd buy it but right now I'm looking at something more affordable down the line but other than that it's a great indica strain and thanks for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews you", "EQQneJocKxs": "whats cracka ladies you may already know that is my ship arrived mr. people plans awesome known is your

sorry it's been a few weeks since I posted I'm going to get back to post in a couple videos a week I've just been super busy with the light depth harvest season how to trim trim trim to win win win all right so let me get to what I'm going to review today it is going to be some huckleberry flower from mr. top this sample tested at seventeen point one six percent THC and point two nine percent CBDs so y'all remember what I do is I get the weed I smoke it for a whole day I record what I like to do in my I record my opinions in my handy-dandy notebook I then go online figure out the genetics the Pleader things like that so I can get all the information that I can then I post it up for you so the genetics are super debated on huckleberry as a strain many seed companies supply huckleberry seeds Oregon huckleberry or just straight huckleberry if you go to attitude seed banks they're going to tell you and show you several different companies that you can get it from the so let me get into just breaking down what mister chronic thinks of mister tops huckleberry alright so the Sun is just getting down on me it's like seven o'clock or something here and so my cameras just dimming out on me and I apologize let me get to this review the looks of this flower are pretty cool you can't really see it very good right now because of the light and because of my camera but the looks of this flower pretty cool it is purple with a nice bright orange head with nice bright orange hairs the density is perfect for smoking or rolling joints no grind required the trim job is about a b-plus the smell is very mild berry with a slight melon finish so for overall bag appeal smells looks and density along with this trichome coverage I mr. chronic rate this huckleberry for mr. tops at a three point eight out of five it could be a little denser and a little bit more pungent or stinky when you open the bag or just through the bag and the trichome coverage is good but it's definitely not great so three point eight out of five for bag appeal so let's move to the next category oh and the flavor of it is kind of like a berry melon shoe but that kind of gets into the next category as for recreational defects this is a good flower for like every day daytime smoke it tastes great man my lighter is like lost in my abyss of pockets so as a recreational affects its every day daytime smoke it's good for that the taste is great mellows your moved just a little bit it increases your appetite and the creativity in your brain it relieves tension and in relieving tension relieve some pain for new smokers I would try it for new smokers I wouldn't smoke it in the morning if you have activity plans it planned it might be a little overwhelming for you but for the average everyday smoker it's a great taste and all-around functional high my wife said it helped my overall demeanor tenfold so I'll keep it around so for all those reasons and more it scores a four point five out of five as a recreational smoke it will take you as high as you want just smoke another bowl or put it down depending on what your tolerance is now as a medicinal smoke the surra with these small aches and pains that also helps with elevating your mood the small increase in appetite will help those who also need it so I'll give it a rating of a three point six out of five it does a few things and it does those things pretty well a way to go huckleberry let me take a rip shout out to Zions and thanks for this cool blast so finally let's answer these questions do I want to smoke more will I recommend this flower to friends and family did I just flat-out like it I would say yes to all these questions it may not be a daily smoke but that taste is awesome so I ready to add a solid 4 out of 5 with a total score of 15 point 9 out of 20 it's not the highest score I've ever given but this is a top three in taste that I've ever had anyhow I'm mr. chronic that was some huckleberry from mr. tops and

and it is a white fire og and chem dog mix and I'm a big sativa smoker so that chem dog and others giving me kind of excited to try this one out let's go for it definitely not a really nice smell in there I'm skunky I kinda has that classic pot smell in there he definitely smelled sativa side of things that chem dogs really sticking out they're really nice and light green and it's really really frosty that's awesome budget definitely pretty easy to break apart little pieces which is nice so it's not too dry [Music] crying's a pretty nice and easy there let's see yeah it's definitely really easy to grind up work with this actually seems to be a make some great pop for a joint in there you realize it easy to roll with that for me I feel that when you grind up but it's a lot like grinding up spices and cooking right so I like to cook a lot too I like to use whole Hulk spices instead of pre ground and then I like to grind it up myself as I'm had in it notice with our spices you kind of get a much stronger flavor from it there instance terpenes are the flavor and scent compounds of most plants and a lot of fruits and vegetables and things we already eaten same as when marijuana I want to break it up because I want to get down inside of the bud and get all the terpenes to come out but just before I'm not smelling it too you know I want that freshness I want to smell and really taste us true to the strain as possible when I'm getting ready to to enjoy it that evening let me see how the smokes [Music] that's nice very smooth in and what I like about some strange notes as you exhale you kind of get that taste in the scent to kind of mix it together for one last time which is nice and estimate F initely did that you got that nice chirping profile coming in and leaving so it made the whole the whole hit very enjoyable it looks really pretty down in that both very nice light green again just got some orange in there probably from that chem dog and you know I'm really a big fan a sativa so it's not burning too fast - even though we ground it down pretty fine it's still about a third full and this isn't that too big of a bull so that's always nice to you know it always sucks when you have that bull and it goes way too quick that you just go just wait to dry and so this means that hearing process done in a in a way that retained at least a little bit of that moisture an acceptable lasts a little bit longer which is always good you don't want to go through your pot super quick jaren kind of start to feel this kind of pull and pull in my eyes back out of that opposite feel of the indica and kind of waking it back up and started feel a little more alert nothing crazy going on my head you know the wheels aren't running too much but I'm definitely little more aware of what's going on attempt to feel and go caffeine kick we've got a big day coming up you need a little extra kick come to cinder where you go to go to the coffee shop in a little little both one more poll here I have at the office is gonna be computers get things done that's where I like sativas get me off the couch get me going get me focused in on something get my tasks done for the day I get to enjoy the rest of the day afterwards this is diva leaning hybrid definitely get you going kind of wakes you up like said earlier is kind of like just drink a little cup of coffee a little caffeine kick right there I feel ready to go do some stuff you know but I some dishes to do or laundry to fold they'd be done probably like 10 minutes it's not too crazy either you know my head's not spinning off in all sorts of directions to kind of some more getting hooked in on one thing and just kind of going for it definitely changed my mood from earlier there's a little sleepy earlier now I'm definitely not no it's nice it's definitely an active one stuff I would definitely smoke some like this you know before doing chores before going out on a hike going running something like that so they were I need to be really focused Alden and you're ready to go energetic jump definitely a very nice daytime option for sure on a smell I actually think this was killer I gave it a 10 I just loved opening it up and getting that really classic kind of pot smell a little skunky a little bit of citrusy and they can tell us the sativa leaner tastes you know it was good wasn't anything that blew my mind so today about seven there cuz you know it tastes really good inhale you get a lot of that same kind of citrusy skunk tasting the terpenes there too just on the exhale is a little more faint than I like but overall I would give this one probably an eight definitely something I would pick up on my own too if I needed to get some things done that day say this is for anybody who needs to get that

actually pushing for legalization you're listening to the corbett report welcome francis is james corbett of corbettreport.com in a conversation that's coming to you on the sixth of july 2015 here in japan 2016 wow i'm still getting the date wrong mark it on your calendar friends we're more than halfway through the year and I'm still calling it 2015 it is 2016 and today we're talking to a good friend and a guest that has been on the corbett report many times in the past that is ellen brown the author of web of debt and the public banking solution she writes at the web of debt blog on ellen brown comm link in the show notes as always and today we're going to be talking about perhaps a different subject than we usually talk to Ellen Brown about she wrote a very interesting two-part article on the war on weed which I will direct your attention to and well balanced for joining us today thanks James great detect you all right well I want to talk about this war on weed article that you've written because i think it is obviously something that is important to a lot of people in the current American political context where we do see this move towards not just decriminalization but legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes and this is a sea change that's been taking place over well I mean decades I suppose but o is specifically in the last few years really gaining momentum and there's one sense in which of course this is a good thing the freedom that people are having to do things that they want with their own body but there's also a second side to this that you explore in this article that I think is important to get on the table and this relates back to how this entire battle over the criminalization or legalization of weed can come back down to the corporate interests and whose interests this is really in so let's just take this from the opening of your article where you write the war on cannabis that began in the 1930s seems to be coming to an end research shows that this natural plant rather than posing a deadly danger to health has a wide range of therapeutic benefits but skeptics question the sudden push for legalization which is largely funded by wealthy investors linked to big AG and Big Pharma all right so to set the table for the conversation about what's happening right now perhaps we should go back and understand the context of this why was marijuana and it's all of its derivatives including industrial hemp made illegal I made into a category one controlled substance in the first place was it out of a genuine fear of public safety or were there other interests behind that move well they were clearly other interest behind a move it was for the American colonists it was the most I think it was the first agricultural crop that that they had him and it was like your patriotic duty to grow hemp hemp was used as money it was actually currency in the colonies and it had many many uses all the way up till the late 19th century it was one of the most important agricultural crops one thing you had to have it for was sales for a ship so if you had any kind of shipping business you you had to have hemp and of course it was for cloth and textiles of various sorts it's more efficient as a as a paper than them growing wood and there they keep coming up with new uses for it and also it's been used for its therapeutic benefits for 2,000 years I mean there's at least the records go back that far it may be one of the oldest therapeutic herbs and there's just the fact that it's a plant I mean it's called a drug but it's a plant we're talking about a thing with roots and leaves and to criminalize a plant seems like a non-starter so mmm in the 1930s it was competing with a number of other businesses including the pharmaceutical the oil pad the oil the paper they were coming out with these new synthetic materials that have would compete with and there was a big problem with immigration oh did in California where right now is you know probably maybe the hub of where they grow medical marijuana in California you had all these Mexicans coming up over the border and this was part of their culture to smoke I wanna it in fact was given a different name it was cannabis when it was part of these natural remedies that all doctors were familiar with and they changed the name to marijuana meaning this happy drug you know that that was the the Mexican name for it and it was said to make women willing to sleep with black people and amazing claims were made for it so so it was an excuse to throw immigrants in jail black blacks and Mexicans and it out of that came this whole big criminal business though that we now have and then so so it was it was admittedly ghal in the 1930s and then under Nixon it with the war on drugs it was criminate schedule and controlled substance which meant it was a deadly dangerous drug with no therapeutic benefit and subject to abuse which is clearly not true it has lots of therapeutic benefit one of its big benefits is uh for cancer which is the biggest a big best business in the u.s. right now so it clearly competes with these drug businesses so why that's the question why all of a sudden if and if in fact it was big corporate money that was suppressing it why have they suddenly gotten behind it they're not just letting it happen but it's big corporate money that's actually pushing for legalization and particularly it's George Soros and the who is a big shareholder in Monsanto and Monsanto just Monsanto and Bayer are in negotiation for Bayer to buy out Monsanto so we're talking big egg and Big Pharma who would like to take over this very large multi-billion dollar business and the only way they would be able to do it clearly would be to impose pharmaceutical regulation on on this alleged drug and make it genetically modified so that I mean we know what GMOs have done to corn and soy and that's that's what they wanted to do to marijuana and there's research going on in Uruguay etc one problem that one reason that has it hasn't been legalized for medical purposes is in federally is that you have to do these very expensive studies and that go through the FDA and nobody nobody of course has been able to afford to do afford to do that or has the profit motive to do it except big drug companies and if they do it they want to patent it and they want to make it genetically modified so walk us through what the the business plan is here on explain for people how it is that making something legal can be done in such a way as to benefits big corporations right now in California it's legal for people who have health problems and you can go to a doctor of your choice and get a permit of that says you know you're allowed to use it and then you can grow it in your own backyard or where we like and but the rules say that it can't be grown for profit in other words you can have these little dispensaries that that are nonprofits that you can pay the people for the work that they do but you can't have corporate shareholders who are sucking profits out who are not actually workers in the business so that forecloses Monsanto big egg and bear and big big big pharmaceutical companies so the way for them to get in is to legalize it which is what the current bill is in California that's what prompted me to write there's a bill that's coming up in November we had a bill that was passed in I think 19 him in the 1990s which was that Compassionate Use Act I think it was some 2 15 was the number on it and um that was the one that allowed use for medical purposes if you've got a permit from your doctor and but it was a an initiative of the of the boaters so then there was a legislative bill passed that put all sorts of pharmaceutical restrictions on it and the problem with that is it was a it was a legislative bill which technically you can't override a voter initiative by the legislature what you need is another voter initiative so now there's another voter initiative pending that would incorporate the legislative act that was already passed I think in last December 2015 so that's what that's what they're trying to do is to it looks like they're legalizing it for all purposes but in fact you have to be over 21 so you know that they're going to be all sorts of teenagers who are sneaking around in the black market who will get caught who will wind up in prison as they are today so you still got big business for the prison industry even people who are not people who are over 21 will still have a problem if their way you know that a lot of users may not qualify for the technical they may not have the sort of health problem that they're that the doctor that they're assigned to you it says qualifies for for medical use and they may not want to take these drugs that are actually made pharmaceutically that are GMO there could be GMO there they for sure they've been extracted they're not the whole plant with the whole whatever the whole therapeutic benefit I mean anybody who's into holistic medicine once the whole plant you can I saw a video of people who were juicing the plant and got amazing I mean it was amazing the things the health problems that these juicing the plant the raw plant you're not smoking it you're not getting any sort of high off it you're not heating it has amazing health benefits and clearly you need a lot of plants to do that you can't just have and whatever the very limited amount that you're allowed to grow yourself and if you have a serious disease like a mass or cancer you're gonna you would need a lot of plant so well I think the the real agenda here is exposed even on the official website for the proposition 64 yes on 64 campaign support the adult use of marijuana acted let's get it right CA org which says the statewide ballot measure to control regulate and tax adult use of marijuana will take a grassroots movement to be a part of it right away I think control regulate and texts are the key is there rather than legalized so perhaps legalized is not quite the right word to be using in this context but that but the taxes will not go to help the state in any way like the schools all the things that we need tax money for it's going to go right into this business of control so it will go back into law enforcement administration of the program itself so mom regulatory agencies which have a history of being tied to the very corporations that they're supposedly regulating as we've seen in all too many sectors of the American industry and economy so that presents us with the conundrum for people who are interested in the legalization of marijuana in California should they be voting no on 64 and if so what what should they be doing positively yes they should be voting no on 64 and there there was a an original bill it's the jack herer bill I don't know the number on it but there are ways that you could legalize it for everybody it would be safe and fair and not under the control of big corporations so the the answer is to reject to the phony solution and work towards what the real solution is although obviously there is not the big corporate money and interest and passion behind the real solution as always alright well thank you for bringing this to our attention I think it is important especially for people in California but for people around the United States and elsewhere the state that are facing similar issues right now it's not just a question of legalization it's a question of how it is legalized

I do think of the bubble the bubble mount that you used to make all the hash whatever this should get to be [ __ ] big dude I'm not gonna lie this isn't we barely kept enough around to do this [ __ ] string review for this [ __ ] [ __ ] knocks me on my ass man yeah we got a zip of this [ __ ] we had just you know been smoking and smoking we were supposed to do the review two days ago we didn't end up doing it like [ __ ] we got to do this before smoke at all yeah I mean this [ __ ] has me [ __ ] passing out you see me going and laying up in my bed at 3:00 in the [ __ ] afternoon dude I'd never do that like you get too high off this [ __ ] and you know your day is pretty much over definitely after smoking this weed I would have to say that I've been raping the strings we've been reviewing lately a little too generously after smoking some real real heavy gigantic organic we you know it's it's a little bit it's a different thing it does feel different like Dan was touching on there I mean the stuffs grown all organic actually veganic so you know no animal products no sprays no heavy metals no GMOs I mean it's really the way that you would want we grown if you were growing it for yourself another thing that's crazy about getting to try this we didn't particularly sure exactly how long this batch or he takes this particular cut but the grandma's cookies I know he's running 12 plus a week sometime right so like you know you guys that are out there buying and you know and us most the time buying you know commercial weed from stores or whatever they're growing the strains that are gonna give him the best yields quickest flowering times nobody's trying to grow these you know connoisseur strains that take 8 9 10 12 weeks you know that means a fully fully develop some people will say that's too long some people say you don't need to go that long I don't think you can [ __ ] argue with anything he's doing with this week no I mean this right here ladies and gentlemen this is the peak like this is the best flower to get I'm gonna go out there and say set it this this is top shelf right here like when you crack it it just has that like sharpie funk to it you know yeah I was gonna say could the cookie turbine the lineage I know this is some kind of OG KB relation obviously you guys know I've said it once I'll say it a million times I [ __ ] love I mean the og KB cookie cut I think is probably my top 2 and maybe my favorite cookie thought of all time right you know I mean it's I'm definitely getting just that classic fire cook eater but like you said there was like a little extra funk in there or something maybe maybe like a Sharpie maybe something like that a lot of times we use these weird descriptive words for terms like gasp we say it smells like you just [ __ ] onto the gas station it doesn't sound good right it is good it's so overused though but this this is different I'm not gonna lie like it does have that cookie aroma but it's much sharper and it almost smells like Elmer's glue or like a [ __ ] sharpie or like remember those what are those sharpies that like magic markers remember this kind of smells like like a dry erase marker yes they were called magic markers you got a much bigger bowl packed in there I actually went a little bit too small on the last one throwing for the gust go once again forgot the ashtray I think we probably average about one out of every 10 videos do we get all the essential pieces here on the table ashtray bongs bold pieces lighters we're making it work I got I gotta be honest with you guys it's always a lot more fun for us it's more of a treat for us we have more fun doing these videos when we get to review something that were truly really excited about that's good that's good all the way down to the bone they gave me the sweats made my face hot but not harsh it's really really good the thing is not too many people actually get their hands on these stuff so when I do I feel very blessed I wish there was more people I mean this guy's had this six lines gone for years he's never changed up he's just kept it on her and you gotta appreciate that you know especially with it where the industry is at these days like that's gonna be very rare it already is very but it's gonna become more and more rare to find that grower that actually puts in time to grow some [ __ ] like this it's really kinda it's more of an artist I mean at this point it's one of those things where it's like there's growing and then there's like part and there's like having you know a passion and dedication like there's people that just do it for the money this guy I can tell you you know from experience just you know from from knowing them well enough and from seeing the passion that he puts into the work you know and the end product like it's not about the money for this guy it's it's about pushing it forward you know it's all trying to push the boundaries and top yourself every single time yeah he's got pride he takes pride in growing the best medicine or you know cannabis that he can and if you put your name on it you should yeah you should you know I guess well we're going to rating this you know this is honestly pretty easy to rate for me so for a fact it's okay effect ten looks ten smell ten tens across the board I don't even know you know there's not much Activision going to it's [ __ ] amazing if you ever get a chance to get your hands on some of this stuff it is pricey I will say that it is pricey but it is well when I smoke weed like this it makes me miss growing weed not because we ever grew me this good right certainly didn't know but just because like when you find some flowers that are just top-notch 11 out of 10 you know what I'm saying and it's rare like we see decent weed all the time we see good weed over time but when you see something special it's rare it's rare and every single time I see this guy's weed yeah it looks like this so that's just I mean it goes to show the dedication to the craft and like this is one of those things like I think this is worth spending a high price tag that a lot of these exotics you know are fetching that are just at today just commercially grown weed I was grown in a warehouse and didn't get the love and attention to detail that it takes to in my opinion priests produce some we'd liked it shout out to cash I'm gonna go in on one more bar here but I'm actually gonna give an 11 on this product on my first 11 if not the person thing past 10 that I've ever given out so shout out to cash 11 on the cookie dough yeah I think it's same for me at the end of the day I'm giving this stuff a perfect score I think that's probably the first time ever in history CCC we both came out perfect scores or anything I'm so stoned you can't you can't not [ __ ] give this partner eleven earns amazing and it joint taste good out of the bong I'm smoking would have it the other day yeah I mean it's definitely got the power it's everything you're looking for when you're looking when you're trying to treat yourself to something you know top shelf you've gotta clean this that [ __ ] fire on Superlift or another string review I'm Danny for the CCC 4:20 and I'm Shane make sure you like this video hit the bell subscribe if you're not already and we'll see tomorrow [Music]", "MflaTuqx8qg":

crab justice ache crab justice like an irk like and getting stepped on in the mossy fields in some masti terrain we've got the anak us rather miracle-working an industrial services society of the cannabis plant has kept us alive throughout the ages cannabis has kept us alive throughout the ages yet is forsaken in federal law and we have to stay forsaken as a farming and not harming and a comprehensive healing movement for betterment protect the Seas whatever you want out of it most I'm cancer cancer fighting cancer shrinking wellness what about what about the the Justice and pain management this is a social issue of our time and the pts whether enough weed is there for the pts recovery my god supposed to be bending over backwards something botanical is not gonna be you know what I think George Washington would have had something to say about that when he created pensions for this country during the valley forge encampment and that whole rigmarole you may remember as as the foundations of this this nation's democracy and the entrenchment of something so ass-backwards as prohibition has got to just stop its defiling our art the integrity of our whole justice system like and an hour we're not we're not doing justice if we've got if we've got nonviolent drug offenders locked up it's not happening guys we have to do that we have to get them out we have to it's just about justice right now because seriously seriously there's there's people who've gotten away with polluting the environment that are not doing time right now you know they polluted they pollute I mean so we're talking about green jobs okay we need green jobs all right we don't want we don't want unsafe drugs [ __ ] with people but we have to trust people we have to trust people that's how I feel about you know I mean unit weather is is is is weed enough of a safety concern to be like [ __ ] with people about it no I don't think so I mean watch over wheeler drunk and stone um you should not be stoned on gone to food it makes me I wouldn't risk it it's it's risky I mean you have to make sure you know it's been like what it takes contra food maybe like 23 hours to set in sometimes so so you could um drive maybe after that i would say um if you feel alert and stuff alright so see I do have health pyaar SE zanmi let me go ahead go ahead we gotta love of the way took something like Paul Revere like Paul Revere calling out I feel the healing zinger we got a boycott Monsanto for favorable uh anti-cancer returns and crop diversity Monsanto if we wanted to clean you up we would have a clean up Monsanto um party but I think you guys just need to shack up shipping just just be on your merry innovation out of your cruddy terribleness um but thanks for having so much money I mean we got it we got it you know you know you want you want something here I mean Monsanto you got to admit Monsanto I mean you [ __ ] you took some [ __ ] you took some [ __ ] over with this [ __ ] here and now we need to stabilize now we need to stabilize the crunk tified pneus that's been depleting we know it's not good for the song birds and the bees that how many how many bees how many birds died from pesticides how many bees have been taken from the neonics to grow GMO corn GMO corn for process not nourishing you know and it's not Montana's crops that are feeding the world not seen those crops are being turned into soy oil and corn syrup and animal feed okay that means we're getting glyphosate not only from wheat when it's desiccated it with glyphosate but also if you eat animals from GMO fig feed which is pretty darn common and so this is the extent that I'm marketing hemp seeds to put in salsa okay and I still need to return a profit on my snack company because we do so many free samples and I believe in it so much that I wanna just free samples for everybody who wants one you know there's got to be a certain level of joyousness that we ascribe to something really unique in nature so wanna let's just sing a song oh my god here comes comi it's coming by okay March for fiber and Omega threes we we serve some donuts that saved our seas we're brain food farming rights catastrophe we had a tent up at the health line of legislation demo for my birthday for my birthday ah birthday I had a legislation demo brain food potluck free snacks information I built a bridge for the transmission not just to penetrate a market but to actually help people navigate their choices around health resources and food help people [ __ ] diversify our dietary diversity so have flex chia I just wants to say about it there's so much to say about it and that's huge guys we have a hot dog challenge it's a hot dog challenge she got ahead of the curve and push for labeling on the carcinogenic protein levels of carcinogenic protein threats that are happening there's something that's happening there with the carcinogenic threats and all my veg friends please remember to cheat up to refer to the fat-soluble pollutants that are carcinogenic dioxin is one the fat-soluble neurotoxins are mercury and PCBs I think PCBs are carcinogenic to boycott Monsanto cleanup Cargill and mitigate Newark this place ain't a sua mitigate minus ax mitigate minus ax we got a fat-headed strategy that happens to reduce the depletion of our ground wani whoo yeah because if you cut out bad fats I mean some of that bad fats is gonna include animal fats most likely being replaced with clean plant fats know what I have to say about paleo [ __ ] is that it's nice that it's like this return to nature and everything I know that there's like a soul seeking like that that's there for all of us I mean it's there for me I want it I want to be closer to mother nature and I have just just to say like you know I don't ascribe to there being it is not humane killing okay so this first of all so you want to keep killing to a minimum at least I mean I say let's bring down cargill's toxic discharges to a trickle I mean they could just be like not as much as they are much much less we switched from much less too much much less and we don't want any I don't I don't want any killing I mean we prefer I prefer I mean you know is it's everybody you know how much can people that take or whatever and it's definitely not something to build our agricultural system around um actually our groundwater is depleted and building that means we have to get the animal agriculture parts of the TPP out of the TPP because Tyson has already gotten to flood Mexico with cheap chicken under NAFTA and that's already incredibly you know damaged a bunch of chickens are manure in our waterways and this through these pesticides and herbicides used on the GMO feed and the prolonged pain of all these chickens and everything it's okay to feel I mean I want to feel so we need to just like you know admit that there's there's a health benefit to the veggie dog being promoted and maybe that health benefit is worth like [ __ ] ten percent of all these things if we have fat balance if we have clean cleansing fats classes in pts recovery okay that's going to clear people up from neurotoxic [ __ ] and give people like the like adequate adequate you know a deficiency chekhov give people a deficiency checkup to say you know here's what your health risks are based on this deficiency checkup and you needed so we do that now so sharing the joy let's love let's save our seas and cancer mitigate march at a hospital very shortly okay clevo got in touch I have more i'm going to keep singing up", "whKSY_-LzJw": "I don't know about you guys I have always wanted to try marijuana sadly the only legal marijuana right now is medical marijuana and I do not have any medical problems but my dad had does and so he uses medical marijuana my dad is a sickness called MS and he always has horrible back pain and he has had six back surgeries so he got a medical marijuana card about two years ago today I will inform you on how to get a medical marijuana card and how to use the marijuana and the benefits that it gives you the first step is to get a medical marijuana card to do this you have to see a doctor and you have to bring all the papers from like your primary doctor let's say you have problems and the doctor will look over those papers and if he thinks or they think that it is okay for you to have medical marijuana they'll sign off and send the papers to state of Florida and then the state of Florida will get them and report review them and then when they approve it they'll send you a card with your ID number and how's your picture and it basically looks like a license now that you have the card you need to know how to use the marijuana so the marijuana comes in different types so you can get flour which is also known as the plant to like bake stuff with you can get processed form like tapes and oils and brownies but smoking it is the most common way to get it into your system and it working fast today I have this stuff that my dad gave me to show you guys they are these like little bits like weed and he puts them into his bait pen and it essentially just vaporizes it so you can smoke it if you're wondering it smells like lemon I don't know how that would be of any importance but it doesn't smell like weed it smells like very strong women so lastly are the benefits of medical marijuana obviously so my dad used to use narcotics and he hasn't been using since he's been using weed and narcotics are more likely to get addicted on and so that's that's something that's very beneficial once you start using weed it also relieves muscle spasms my dad has a lot of muscle spasms and so this just helps control them and/or stop them yeah also it's a sleeping aid he normally takes like whatever he has at night so that he can sleep better because he has a hard time sleeping because he takes a lot of medication and it just can mess up his sleeping schedule so he likes to do it before bed so that he can kind of get some sleep and last but not least it helps reduce depression and anxiety my dad has very bad depression and he would take depression pills and he still does but this this definitely helps him get by and I was bad depression as he would so in conclusion I hope that I informed you on how to get a matter of cold marijuana card how to use the mare and how it comes in and also the benefits that it gives to the user I also hope that this is not make you want to smoke illegally because I'd be very bad and you would get in a lot of trouble",

"pbEgYV5-p0Q": "what is going on welcome back to another edition of our Strang review series a cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I am going to be looking at a brand new strain to the channel it is the banana punch bread by symbiotic genetics and we're gonna take a look at it right here on the ice mocha Channel just before I get things kicked off I want to mention that this video is sponsored by seedsman go over to their website if you want to enter hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of seeds from some world leading breeders I will leave a link in the description on with the video let's talk about the background of banana punch banana punch has a lovely sound name to it doesn't it this combines two strains banana og also known as banana cush and purple punch combined together by symbiotic genetics to deliver the banana punch now going back into the genetics a little bit further we would expect both of those strengths to fall more on the body led side but there's gonna be a spectrum as there always is when we consume cannabis speak up to marijuana Mike the grower on this one you can see from he's Brandon I've really liked the branding we'll talk about it a little bit more as we move on to the appearance of this cannabis strain as I just mentioned in the intro called branding starting to see a lot more in this glass jar with a metal lid making it fully recyclable this has got a cool compartment where you can look through at the flowers inside opening it up you can see that it's a nicely presented buds inside so the buds themselves try not to move on to the smell section I'll save that for just a moment by I am getting the smells coming out for the butts themselves a really cool look to it this one nice trim job sparkling with trichomes light colored pistols good development it's got that kind of organic nicely grown bud look not to like beefed and puffed out and just uniform like with PGR influence these buds have got their own look their own individual look to each bud very light in appearance that kind of sparkly right matte and green shade have I ever said sparkly matte before that's weird in it if you look in the light is sparkly if you look out of the light it's kind of got a matte Sheen to it really cool it's complex but no Purple's no blues is just greens and and hints of the orange yellows of the pistil it's a really nice look to the banana punch actually reminds me of the look of the purple punch quite a lot trim to perfection no leaves left on there that covers the appearance let's talk about the smell of banana punch as I was opening the jar for the appearance section the banana smell literally hit my nostrils while the while the jar was still down here it smells like banana with hints of like fruit salad like maybe like pineapple or something like that but the most prevalent aroma is the banana now also sitting underneath that is it's like mother of all berries type aroma that what I used to describe as a coffee cannabis type of smell that is definitely sitting in there as well what smoked a lot of mother of berries and I can smell that slightly in this purple punch I've also smoked a lot of banana cush not so much but it smells absolutely fantastic let's break one of these buds open and see what we can gauge from the inside here we go 'banahna earthy hints of like we skunk that tropical skunk like Hawaiian haze hints not quite but like along the same ilk and it's got kind of like a a dankness to the smell as well it's not just light and and aromatic is also like oh it's also got some of that power creeping into the aroma as well really interesting stuff let's talk about the taste of the banana punch some to consumption methods today as you can see got my bong here I've got my mighty vaporizer that's going to give us a good idea of both the flavor and the smoking experience of the banana punch so I'm gonna grind up one of these buds also let you know if I'll get any more smell prop up there on a smell to it wah but honest meal to it that your night not something I come across as often as the other fruit flavors and honors technically a berry but the fruit flavors that are often prevalent in cannabis are citrus oranges strawberries this banana is out there but I don't come across them as much meaning that this is a nice and somewhat different smell it's what I'm normally standing here reviewing so I'm gonna put some into the mighty vaporizer we're gonna heat that up and while that's heating up we're gonna smoke a bomb of it so if you are getting yourselves ready to join us get those bowls filled get those joints rolled get those fabrics heated up preparation time right about now got the mighty on join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] delivers a very earthy taste to it actually those oh gee flavors coming through the fruity notes can also be tasted somewhat but perhaps not as strongly again as came through in the aroma we see how the mighty treats us because it will give me a much better idea that complex flavor than smoking it through the bomb the smoking experience was enjoyable it didn't feel the need to cuff we have got the mighty you heat it up now let's taste the vapor oh man that's got a really nice taste in vapor 'banahna like eucalyptus or mint or mint feel like something around that area of terpenes is is coming through the vaporizer we have like a really nice banana taste that sits on your tongue as well this isn't aptly named strain I think it's come away a fair bit from the purple punch from my experience of smoking purple punch as I said I haven't tried banana OG but what I can say is this delivers a lovely unique flavor profile like nothing that I've tasted before which gives it good marks from me in the flavor Department from the vaporizer I'm definitely getting a really nice tasting vapor nice and then a lot of stuff I put free unique different and distinguishable enough to give it very good marks through the bum I'm getting a nice smoking experience but not as much of the flavor as I'm getting through the vaporizer it's still tastes nice and as I always say a bong is a great way to get high so I like it from the smoking experience perspective but unlocking that banana no flavor or in the vapor either is a must do if you want to truly appreciate the flavor of the banana punch saying that I'm gonna smoke another Bowl so join me for this and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] it feels like I'm getting some of the flavor notes but the smoke may be burning slightly hotter than some of the cool smoking strengths that I've been talking about recently not in an accurate way not in a way which suggests that it isn't clean or isn't grown as well might even be a strain dependent might be to do with the trichomes some strains are more expansive than others the platinum jelly that I reviewed last time was super smooth actually through the bonk so this could potentially be less move because of that but yeah I'm really liking the flavor anyway let's talk about the effects of the banana punch so as I'll talk to you right about now we've had two bongs and wait some continued into votes um it has now been several minutes since I smoked and vote the banana punch and I am feeling the effects nicely I can tell you that this hits on the body LED side of the spectrum it has got that pleasurable high that comes from the purple punch side of the lineage which gives me a really sort of nice most like cuddle type height if that makes sense to you guys it also has the familiar relaxation that you get from smoking those og strains what we classic you call indica is present you know and it's and it's nice it feels like it's not a strain that's gonna induce anxiety or paranoia compared to other strains on the hybrid or head-high side of the spectrum my mind feels quite calm but my body feels very relaxed I'm certainly feeling this nice body led feeling burn on a punch hits reasonably hard I know I've smoked two bowls of it and had a vaporizer as well so I've consumed a reasonable amount but I'm feeling nicely relaxed for the time of day I like to smoke fresh in these reviews so that you guys get a good idea of how the strain hits me and actually I'm glad that I waited a little bit before filming the effects segment so you could see the effects kicking in a little bit more it's made me sort of happy a little bit on the giggly side very relaxed and just chilled is the best way to describe it and also feels like it could be good on the pain relief inside if that's something that people are suffering with unless something's up so today we've been looking at symbiotic genetics banana punch a lovely cross of banana og and purple punch I've got a lot of love for one of his parents trains and this I must say has also impressed me its impressed me more than the mimosa which is purple punch cross with Clementine appearance-wise it looks similar to the purple punch but hasn't got that nice sort of edgy looked at at Budds I'm sure that differ from Fino to phyno and know this was grown from seed and that there are other seeds that they can potentially grow in the future so some really cool stuff might come out of that pack smell wise I like the smell of this one now again there's probably going to be some variation between phenotypes but this captured the banana wonderfully it captured sort of pineapple notes this tropical xxxx pungency that really delivered a nice smell so I like it is unique good marks from me and the aroma flavor-wise I've really enjoyed the flavor through the mighty vaporizer particularly where I've got those banana notes that tropical nests that earthy sweet taste came through nicely smoking it in my balm maybe a little bit hotter but still smooth smoke just not delivering as complex a flavor profile as I got when I was vaping it which is understandable when you feel terrine it through water and smoking in a bong anyways more for the smoking experience and the power then the flavor fire this consumption method in my opinion and effects wise it's a really nice hi guys I like it for the daytime because it makes me feel chilled and happy but getting pain relieving qualities as well it's what would traditionally be defined as an indica strain but we're going to try and move away it's just hard because in my vocabulary and synonymous with the culture for for the whole time that I've been doing this but we'll try to move away and start describing it in more of a accurate modern terminology I've always in the future when people watch these videos they'll think I'm outdated overall I'm really enjoyed smoking on the banana punch it's a nice strain nice genetics I don't know if I've had any of symbiotic genetics strains before run the channel but this has certainly been an interesting one that is gonna be it for the video guys what I want to know from you is what is the fruitiest cannabis strain that you have enjoyed leave that in the comments and remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you're enjoying

Greene in the video today I'm gonna be doing what I do each and every Wednesday which is covering another cannabis strain for your enjoyment this week I had a strain which I've been excited to try for a while this is animal cookies it is a cross of Girl Scout cookies and fire OG and apparently is a bit of a strong one so without further ado join me for this week's cannabis strain with you exclusively on the ice moment YouTube channel really really excited to try this this is imported from the US I'm not sure what part I don't want to say California without known for certain pick up holy ground boys and I am looking forward to trying it out as always what I'm gonna do is cover four things about this but that is the appearance the smell the taste and the effect we're gonna get into it this is a hybrid Australian what I am looking for is a really powerful cookie strain looking at this but in detail is really frosty but not in a sparkling or a glistening way the bud is looks like it's just been covered in dusty trichomes the pistols are really not a parent at all they're wrapped around in within the Tri phone coverage the bud itself is really sort beefy really compact and dense that's probably gonna grind out into a fair bit coloration is a very light green dusty wire and the trim job has been done perfectly there aren't any bits here that I can get off it just looks quite different to some of the other but that I get it looks like it has been imported the way that I can usually tell is by some compression happening when you squeeze it all together and that does damage the or change the look of the the bud a little bit to me this has got the sort of look to it that I would expect from imported but as you can see it is a nice looking strain guys now covers the look next we are going to go into smell off the animal cookies let you guys know the whiffs that is giving me myself little smell I'm getting like this sort of cookie smell but it's got something else different in with it now it's difficult to gauge I think I need to break this open a little bit mmm maybe even grind some up to get really good idea at the smell of this animal cookies this is one that as I have been opening up the crop jar and just checking on it making sure it's okay it usually gives a really nice sweet [ __ ] and it's difficult now because I've had it open in my hands for a while that sort of disappeared a little bit so I'm gonna try and grind some up you guys know how it smells it's got very similar smell to the Girl Scout cookies it's reminiscent of that cookie smell more for me I haven't tried fire OG so I'm not sure I've had plenty of Wi-Fi OG which is white fire OG but how don't think I've tried to fire Reggie so I'm not sure how much of that site it will take mmm lovely cookies is the main thing I'm not sure where the animal comes from to be honest I'm just getting the cookie smell but it is obviously completely different color to like the blue cookies and it is a completely different color to the Girl Scout cookies that I tried out in Barcelona not a particularly strong smell er at the moment I might add is by no means filling up the room with that scent now I wonder whether that's potentially because the age of the sample but I am not quite sure interesting stuff of course we're gonna know a lot more about this bug once we get some incident bomb I have with me today the wheat star Vasavi line bomb discontinued that gave one of these away a couple of weeks ago to a very very lucky Teresa Nelson so congratulations once again this is quite quickly becoming one of my favorite glass pieces and today I'm gonna consume some of the animal cookies through this bottle this is the part where if you want to smoke along vapor long dab along you can get your bongs ready get it joints rolled need a breeze heated up and join me for this one as we go through to the rest of the animal cookies that you guys know how it's tasting and what the effects are see you on the other side guys Cheers has a really smooth bomb and quite a significant lack of intensity there when I was able to one can shave it all in one hit and to not ferrule like it was too much so that was actually really nice through the wig stylist I'll be lying bum how did it tight so I got a bit of that cookies taste coming through through the bung it wasn't particularly over a parent it wasn't something that was in my face but it was very smooth very nice taste in and I actually did get some of the flavor of the cookies coming through wow it was a bit in descript it wasn't anything that particularly stuck out it was enjoyable to consume through the balm which actually is still better than quite a few of the strengths which may become a bit too much intensity or don't taste right or aftertaste or taste gets lost it's not something that's left a particularly strong taste in my mouth at the moment and it isn't something which I could picked out from a lineup if I'm honest but it isn't bad tasting it's a nice strength to see now I've sort of left it in the pop chart for a pan I'm opening it I'm getting really nice a really nice sort of an almost less sweet cookie smell it slightly sweeter than the other cookies that I have smell it's not as nice as the Applejack not as nice as the object but I had from the US in my opinion the Applejack was a nicer smell and taste so far but I am NOT somebody that goes crazy for cookies I do like cookies strange but I wouldn't say that I particularly and so the highest bathroom compared to other strains they are nice and let's talk about the effects of the animal cookies guys this is a hybrid strain it is one which should give feelings such as happiness relaxation creativity that sort of stuff I love hybrid strains I love it when they hit you just in the middle and often you do find that they've taken on the other so I usually feel more uplifted or more chilled out as I talk to you the effect of the animal cookies are kicking in now and Wow is a strong one I am getting fantastic feelings of relaxation watching over me notably feel nice time just sitting in the chair good and I am yes I feel full effects at this strain I like the animal cookies guys but keep doing this to myself as much tolerance gone down my doing bonds that are too big and keep [ __ ] myself up quite a lot on the first hit this is great but yeah I can certainly feel the I'm stoned that's the best way to put it feeling good feeling relaxed and yeah feeling pretty happy about it I would put this on a very sort of high end of the spectrum in terms of how far that gets you one bong here I know it was my first bump it but wow that's taken me out of the game for a little while gonna go in Chanel in a bit I'll group what do I think about the animal cookies it is an absolutely potent strain across the Girl Scout cookies and fire roti one bond of it has left me feeling [ __ ] and I'm a bouncer here number one and yeah it's a strain which I really really like now in terms of the look it really compact and dense and dusty see it been imported in terms of the smell of it I'm getting a really nice cookies smell but it didn't come for it too much until I shut up job for a while and opened it up in terms of the taste didn't come for a lot but what did come through was enjoyable there wasn't that intensity there and I want me to do a nice big here and yeah in terms of the effects it has left me like this which as you can see in a pretty [ __ ] wood I smoked the animal cookies again I certainly would is a strain which I am now gonna be on the lookout for because it is a potent one guys what did you think of this review let me know in the comments and I will be back with another strain with you very soon guys have a great rest of your week and keep token [Music]", "5B1KfyAGCkg": "[Music] Wow [Music] party what is up guys and welcome back to Chris cloud TV this 21 over channel better get people of marijuana music sports game in a very much more so today's episode of Hersh cos TV we're going to be doing a strand review of some limited edition purple diesel so hopefully you guys at home I was smoking device letting me join cannabis related products throughout so long as you're up to age of 21 years of older so we picked up some purple diesel here for 28 bucks for three and a half cramps real quickly will show you guys and tell you guys the stats here TCA is nineteen point fifty percent CBD a zero point ten percent total TT is seventeen point seventy percent in total CBD is 0.19 percent harvested at 11:21 of 2016 purple diesel done by couch lock productions like I said twenty eight bucks for an eighth limited edition let's go ahead will real quickly give you a close-up shot of this purple diesel here get it to autofocus a little bit nice light green bud to kind of a blondish color up in there got some nice amber orange hairs in there and of course we got some purple you can tell but broke off there so the huge the center up there is really light green almost white pretty good trichrome production kind of leafy though be nice if it was a little bit better manicured job but this was only twenty eight bucks and eight so can't complain pretty good manicure medica job for what it is show you guys another bud here and we'll be getting into the smoke look at the purple there there's some purple for y'all apologize about the shake and holy [ __ ] my hand will not stay steady so yeah we got some purple some white green amber orange two bright orange hairs on this one here like I said you can see that Center right there we got a little purple in the center on this one a very light green like I said a really good try chrome production really dense nug not too fresh not too dry but we're gonna get into the smell test the taste test and the heart test high test the high test of this purple diesel here so go ahead and get smoking along guys and so the small test of this purple diesel here gets a 5 out of 5 very strong lavender floral smell mixed in with a very strong Sour Diesel funk smell to it they blend in very well so you get that nice mix of a floral lavender that's kind of sweet but also very strong very pungent mixed in with that super pungent that district that's just that just makes you gives you that stank face that sour faces whoo that Sour Diesel pungent and with mixed in with a little bit of pine but the small test hopefully a 5 out of 5 likes it very strong very loud package as well as great smell greens taste us cheers y'all Green's taste-test gets a 5 out of 5 tastes just like it smells get that very strong floral lavender sweet taste mixed in with that very strong Sour Diesel funk with that little hint of aftertaste at the very end of pine it's not very strong very long-lasting on the palate still taste it right now it still feels like I'm still got smoking my my mouth right now as you can see I don't but definitely a 5 out of 5 for the greens taste test like I said great tasting with that sweet floral lavender taste mixed in with that Sour Diesel funk skunky counter taste to it it's a little hint of pine in the aftertaste now after green taste test on this purple diesel here gets a 4 out of 5 and the fifth and six hit you lose the aftertaste of that pine and overall you do lose a little bit of flavor and the overall taste itself but besides that even in that fifth and six it I still got a very very strong floral lavender sweet taste mixed in with that soured Diesel's you know skunky funk kind of taste to it and it's so has really good flavor like I said I do lose the aftertaste of that pine in the after greens taste test and like I said it does it's not as strong as it was in the first hit with the floral and the Sour Diesel skunked to it come up for the most part still has a great flavor and I definitely give it a 4 out of 5 for the after greens taste test after greens taste us and the high the high I definitely give it a 5 out of 5 I'd say after taking about seven hits here we still got nice fat Bowl in here I am well and [ __ ] stoned I got a nice relaxing somewhat couch walking indica hi body hi with that very energetic kind of heady Spacey sativa head high but very strong first couple hit you start feeling the effects immediately and it's a very well balanced fit 250 head - indica split high and like I said very strong hit you right away so you don't have to sit there and smoke up a bunch of your weed to get stoned so definitely a 5 out of 5 for the high and my official review here of this limited edition purple diesel that is done by couch lock productions I will have to give it a five out of five it smells great it looks [ __ ] awesome it's definitely you know it's something they look something cool to look out you know we got the [ __ ] the purple on there you got the light green no it's definitely a very interesting but look at when it smells great it tastes great but on the green stasis and after greens taste test it get your stone real quick and has a good well-balanced 50/50 hybrid split heart so my fissure review is definitely a 5 out of 5 definitely some great stuff I do like this I will be picking this up again for 28 bucks an 8 that's a great [ __ ] deal as well for some really good [ __ ] cannabis there don't be some top-shelf quality cannabis for only 28 bucks and eight that's it that's a one hell of a deal right there but I definitely recommend you guys to go to your medical or recreational wherever you get your cannabis at this sounds like a frame that might interest you definitely go check it out I enjoyed it it tastes great smells great and they get you stoned that's all you need with weed so if you like those flavors that I was telling you about those smell sells funny about the high I've been telling you about definitely go check this out like I said at your medical or recreational or get your cannabis at go pick up a gram

tasters cannabis reviews episode and today we're going back man we're throwing it back with some classic gaps as I say it it kicks in we're doing a review today on noble Farms cherry pie cherry pie being the classic strain this is like one of the first strains I ever grew cherry pie if you haven't had it it's a super gassy sweet flavored strain that like probably was the like one of the first strains to lead to all the exotic strings that we have now like this was this was one of those strings when it came out everybody was raving about yo you need to get some cherry pie literally I remember 2009 2008 member whenever cherry pie first came out and it was available in California to buy it record but not wreck shops medical shops I drove all the way to San Francisco 7:00 in the morning and bought like 10 cherry pie clothes and I was like my first real borough I grew a bunch of different stuff granddaddy purple cherry pie whatever was available back then but that was I bought it at burners club - that was a funny thing I bought it the THC which is the hemp center that was a burnished Club way back in the day but yeah man this cherry pie right here super fire from noble Farms hello affordable I got the [ __ ] for 35 dollars and eight and it's way worth it as soon as I opened it boom kicked me right in the face with that sweet gassy smell new right away just because I grew this before I smoked tons of it I knew right away okay that's 100% cherry pie done right smells good looks great - tastes [ __ ] amazing cherry pie is across a lot of granddaddy purple and Durbin poison both of those super sought-after gasps strains so putting those together is what brought this [ __ ] beautiful bun to fruition and yeah man this uh this one right here is tested in at 23 percent THC zero percent CBD yes fire its fire like for me I give cherry pie on the on the rating scale like specifically Nobel forms I give there's like an 8.5 because it looks good smells good tastes good and it's affordable could it have been more gassy and more sweet absolutely you know it's a hybrid strain so it's not really like super into kendama knit like I like or super heavy you know that's kind of what I'd look for what I'm trying to find a weed that I like but if you're somebody who looks for a balance a balance strain that's gonna give you a little bit of both I would definitely recommend this and for the price link you can buy two weights to this you know for around the price that you're gonna get 1/8 of like some exotic [ __ ] and I think this is [ __ ] it's not all the way in the 90s but it's it's right there it's gas so I would [ __ ] with it but yeah man [ __ ] I'm definitely gonna look for more stuff from noble Farms I first time ever happened them first I'm tryna I was over there at Green Theory on a bell red and one of the budtender said man you gotta try this stuff right here and uh I grunt cherry pies I said you know let me take that chance see if they got it and then very pleased with noble form so eight point five noble Farms cherry pie oh yeah make sure you guys keep an eye out and go look for that and once the game man there's been another

looking to take advantage of all the fun while you might believe your weed comes from the neighborhood mom and pop grew up around the corner the truth is that the business of marijuana is turning corporate faster than you may have expected and that's because major players are trying their hand at the ganja game and that includes the one corporation that's been the definition of big agriculture

two decades Monsanto has turned to the agriculture industry to create and sell genetically modified seeds to farmers their GMO seeds allow farmers to grow plants that are immune to harmful pesticides and herbicides so they can spray their crops with roundup what you guessed it is also made by Monsanto so all your friend compute apples can remain untouched by any other form of life just the way nature intended right yeah but Monsanto is now moving its sights from corn crops to cannabis crops and while Monsanto hasn't officially patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana yet it's still entirely possible that the day will come the corporation is in the process of merging with German chemical company Bayer which is partnered with GW Pharmaceuticals which uses genetics to create its own proprietary marijuana medication and with 66 billion dollars on the line for this merger you can bet money that Monsanto is going to utilize the hell out of this cannabis co-op the rest of the marijuana industry is afraid that this merger will give Monsanto the power and influence to do to legalize weed whether it's already done de corn tobacco and other cash crops basically owning exploiting and clean rolling it organizations like the cannabis Genome Project however are working to protect the genetic makeup of marijuana by making its DNA public since much of marijuana research has been restricted up until now sir goal is to learn more about the biology of cannabis share that information and piss off Monsanto and other corporations by preventing them from exclusively marketing certain strains at the plant something Monsanto loves to do just ask those corn farmers Monsanto and Bayer recognized that America shifting attitudes towards marijuana restrictions will give them the opportunity to make a profit if they start investing now but this is America and money talks could their involvement actually help Federal legalization happen and if this is the road we have to take to get there are we all are on board until then here's what you can do to protect the integrity of marijuana and keep these maniacal corporations from ruining the industry while it's still in its infancy learn everything you can about what you're putting into your body eat GMO free organic and local foods when you can and read your labels but don't let that conscious consumerism end with your food find the source of your weed ask your dispensary visit the Farb support local agriculture grow your own follow marijuana news and legislation be an educated consumer and know that your dollar has power where you choose to spend it especially in a developing industry will help to determine its outcome what are your thoughts on all of this why don't you take another hit and let me know in the comments below thanks for watching Mary Jane news y'all I'm Brooke burgstahler", "cNldGWXh7Ug": "I would love to know where this was grown. Who grew it. I would love to know if there are pesticides\nused on it. EMILY ATKIN WANTS TO KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THE\nLEGAL MARIJUANA SHE SMOKES AS SHE DOES ABOUT THE FOOD SHE EATS. BUT THE PRODUCT LABELS ON RECREATIONAL POT\nWHERE SHE LIVES IN D.C. DON\u2019T SAY MUCH. (Emily reading label) RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS LEGAL IN THE DISTRICT. BUT NO ONE REGULATES IT, SO THERE\u2019S NO TESTING\nAND NO ONE\u2019S REQUIRED TO TELL YOU WHAT\u2019S IN IT. I know that other places have testing of their\nproducts and they can be assured of things that I just can\u2019t and I do find it a bit\nunfair. MARIJUANA MYSTERIES AREN\u2019T LIMITED TO D.C. GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT\u2019S IN LEGAL POT MAY DEPEND ON WHERE YOU LIVE. BECAUSE CANNABIS ISN\u2019T LEGAL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE\u2019S A PATCHWORK OF REGULATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY. STATES SET THEIR OWN LAWS AND THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING FOR THINGS LIKE BACTERIA, MOLD OR PESTICIDES, RESIDUAL CHEMICALS, EVEN HEAVY\nMETALS LIKE MERCURY OR LEAD. ALL THOSE THINGS CAN END UP IN MARIJUANA. AND MAKE YOU SICK. Just the average person concerned for their\nhealth is also going to be worried about these contaminants. IT\u2019S THE JOB OF DAN KULAKOWSKI TO FIGURE\nOUT IF WHAT\u2019S IN THE POT PRODUCTS PEOPLE USE. HE\u2019S THE LAB DIRECTOR AT A FACILITY RUN\nBY STEEP HILL. THEY\u2019RE A COMPANY THAT TESTS CANNABIS ACROSS\nTHE COUNTRY. TRANSPARENCY, HE SAYS, IS THEIR GOAL. As labs, we\u2019re not the cops. We\u2019re not the regulators. We\u2019re just providing the data to the customers\nand to the state. BUT THE DATA LABS TRACK, THE TESTS THEY PERFORM, EVEN WHAT\u2019S CONSIDERED AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION IS DIFFERENT FROM STATE TO\nSTATE. IN MICHIGAN FOR EXAMPLE, BATCHES OF MEDICAL\nMARIJUANA HAVE TO BE INSPECTED FOR THINGS LIKE RUBBER SHAVINGS OR HAIR, AND TESTING\nFOR PESTICIDES AND HEAVY METALS LIKE MERCURY AND LEAD IS REQUIRED BUT THOSE TWO TESTS ARE OPTIONAL FOR RECREATIONAL POT IN WASHINGTON STATE. THEY DON\u2019T EVEN HAVE A LAB CERTIFIED TO\nTEST FOR HEAVY METALS. AND IN OREGON, TESTING FOR SOMETHING AS SCARY\nAS E.COLI IS DONE AT RANDOM, WHILE CALIFORNIA REQUIRES THAT WITH EVERY BATCH, ALTHOUGH WE FOUND YOU DON\u2019T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE A SCIENCE DEGREE TO RUN A LAB THERE. We\u2019re working very hard right now to come\nup with some sort of standardized system that can be applied to all states. THIS IS MORGAN FOX WITH THE NATIONAL CANNABIS\nINDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WHILE HE SAYS GROWERS, PRODUCERS AND EVEN\nLABS WANT NATIONAL TESTING STANDARDS, THEY\u2019RE NOT FANS OF STRICT REGULATION THAT COULD STIFLE EVOLVING SCIENCE. AND HE POINTS OUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW EXAMPLES OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS WITH POT, EVEN WHEN IT WASN\u2019T LEGAL. We absolutely want the product to be as safe\nas it can be. Just because it\u2019s safer than what\u2019s available\non the illicit market doesn\u2019t mean what\u2019s available on the legal market can\u2019t get\nbetter. THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, EVEN IN STATES\nWITH WIDE REGULATION OF TESTING. IN CALIFORNIA, WHERE POT WAS BROADLY LEGALIZED\nLAST YEAR, EARLY MANDATORY TESTS FLAGGED HUNDREDS OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF PESTICIDES\nAND MOLD. BUT HEALTH OFFICIALS EMPHASIZED THEY HAD NO\nVERIFIED REPORTS OF ILLNESSES STILL LEGAL USERS LIKE EMILY, SAY THEY DESERVE\nTO KNOW WHAT THEY\u2019RE PUTTING IN THEIR BODIES. People are worried about what\u2019s in these\nproducts for sure. I mean my friends and I have talked about\nit. I think it should get tackled before something\nbad happens.", "C0mCtnfmWUU": "peace and many blessings my beloved brothers and sisters um so i am going to start playing the video that i recorded now please stick with me i was very tired i was going through my training um for my job and so yes you will hear a a tired ned so i hope you enjoy this and that it is edifying to the spirit and may god be all forgive me and make the presence of the lord be with you all in the authority the name of jesus and god bless you all [Applause] god shalom you all in jesus name this is a video from end times tucked away on a quiet street as you see that there pay attention to that please and we'll remember that before i will post a picture later in the illuminati after i edit this and also some symbolic symbolism i saw in this show from the stars network called uh american gods travel to denver hanging out for ourselves at the end again this is intense production modern day video so shout out to them and for going there i just want everyone to see the church get from support of you outside that is um until you notice the oddly placed artwork covering this the doors very [Music] animals okay and surely that does it's like checkers clearly those are deities you got the mocking taken from their website okay the eyes of which it looks very simple like um and they're now these birds the significance that i saw behind them are the differences on the meaning of that being one may have what feels like a transcendental experience woman in those moments or one woman like one's a bird that has a bird as a baby but they're in both mothers as babies right and experience um in those moments and then the other one has an actual son and look what's on his son one may one may receive the meaning one requires at that time and okay look familiar i'll show you some things at the end uh [Music] not aliens dirty they are ash trees now and let's take a closer look and see if we can figure out who is really guys i'm just a little exhausted today because one thing is for sure it's definitely not and as you see this the skull sitting in the center of the chapel directly behind the altar is a massive skull and and you know everything they always have these destructions specific symmetrical symbols geometrical can be traced all the way back oh ancient battles where skulls were used thanks for cross crosses and skulls throughout history you see the use of skulls and prominent figures each and every one of them has a way to corporately show their allegiance to them this problem can still be seen today have you ever wondered why so many celebrities are obsessed with skull symbolism i mean the next symbol we found is the egg of life and up there see we see this this specific symbol and they actually put this specific symbol on all kinds of children's and is said to contain vital information on the secrets of the universe good luck with that so i'm going to this is just another example of the mystery religions trying to bypass god with their seat okay so right here on the right bottom corner that was exactly what was shown at the space needle in washington state mk ultra ritual right in front of your face everyone mk ultra ultra ritual great knowledge good luck with that the earliest record of this symbol was found on the alabaster steps that were once part of the palace of king ashurbanipal it's been dated for instance this is there's kabbalah concentric that symbol is also also in another show finally take a screenshot and post next we have the only cross in the building and is sitting directly inside the belly of a rising phoenix i guess you could call that or possibly out of the origins we know about the serpent on the mountain and i'll post a picture of that as well north america in all probability were nephilim hybrids the thunderbird was a spirit of the underworld and a symbol for war the position of the cross directly inside of the belly of the beast is no accident it's a declaration of war this brings us to the most telling symbol inside the so-called church the all-seeing eye of lucifer also known as the evil [Music] it represents the spiritual eye of lucifer and the fact that our world can escape its magical reach in the january 1991 edition of progress for all magazine researcher john todd wrote and i quote the seal of the pyramid was created by the rothschild family and brought to north america by benjamin franklin and alexander hamilton before 1776. the rothschild family is the head of the organization which i entered in colorado all of the occult brother supposedly the rothschilds have personal dealings with the fact that they call themselves a church which by its very definition means a building used for public christian worship is an absolute assault to christianity wait look let's go back definition means a building used for public works that i got from my doctor's office for my children look at her pants look at this this fallen angels pants and and just the stars and and the different colors uh you know the bricks masonry um the those hats the pointed nose the polka dots the rainbow the stars and then the colors that drip from it uh yeah pay attention to that for us i will be posting something at the end as well also there um on the left fallen angel uh deity looking thing has a mohawk in different colors there's something significant about this i will post a picture that resembles this that is i've seen in a video game i don't play video games but i like to get them and look at certain things and and then let it help us glean from what we can see from it for those who have eyes to see and ears his ear which i pray you all do in jesus name anyways guys um so let's absolute assault to christianity the very instead of christ in other words to replace christ and that is exactly exactly that so yeah for those of y'all that were at um bro theo's last lesson um we do not need to be partaking and smoking any sort of marijuana anymore in my opinion i am speaking from my experiences as well the marijuana these days is gmo it is not what it used to be and if you need some advice on that try cbd with delta eight in it um it it does what it's it it's supposed to do and it is not psychoactive um you are supposed to test the spirit by the spirits so i'm just trying to give some helpful advice i do not i'm not a doctor or physician i would say go see your doctor if you're having any sort of issues but i can speak from experience by allowing the lord to teach me and chastise me and show me where i need to stop doing certain things do less of other things and do lots of the things he intends for me to do by practically applying it to my life i pray these words ratifying forgive me guys i am exhausted today i'm not sure why i feel so tired today didn't get much rest last night i went out with the family so that was a beautiful um moment to be able to spend time with the family first time in a while i thank you all for who keeps my family um and myself and y'all's prayers because prayers are as i've said a thousand times our direct line to the most high god and um i pray you are all in good health and wealth wealth of the spirit you know spiritual wealth you know um for what we have is in the kingdom not here we're just passing through but it doesn't mean that the father doesn't want to give you a good expected end um i'm grateful and thankful to be coming out of this this um refining period of my life and i i view things in such a different manner now that um my maturity and my growth in in my relationship with jesus christ our messiah okay the messenger okay um of abba god's messenger his son sent in flesh god sent in flesh whom left us the holy spirit whom is not it it is a person and i pray that my words are edifying for you all i love you all um and just know we have each other we're always a finger click away so god bless you all much love shalom and i'll see you soon and shout out to brother days finally we got to see your face love you man much love see you all bro mr theobrin sedan uh sister nisa sister minister t david uh uh brother reuben uh cookie cruncher uh cat dizzle in the hizzle uh blue uh of course today's uh brother mr brad um nana p uh uh eric codd um ronnelle evans when he seen you in a while uh sir senor uh ronniel evans um who else uh dank bud um paul nicole christian um cameron and if i missed everyone trying to diss you charges to my head don't charge it to my head turn to my heart charge to me being tired god bless you all i love you all see you all soon here in the fellowship this coming tuesday peace and many blessings to you all in the authority of the name of jesus praise god hallelujah shalom i'm out god bless all right so you see the colors with this goofy goober and the duality and the um dog you saw the beak on his face where you can stop and pause i i asked y'all to please get involved stop pause pay attention to the things that i'm posting um so yeah that beak um and you saw those things in that church that had beaks so that's not by happenstance now as you see also pay attention to the roof it is being lifted off you have this beast running through a marketplace where you see checkered floors it is not black and white but it is gray and red which is still the same thing now look at these guys uh shapeshift um i wouldn't call them guys but they're definitely this is this is real okay they again back to the duping the light of last night uh the the devil gets a dupe in the light when he puts all this in your face and then you think oh it's just it's just a tv show blah blah blah no okay well that went too quick so go back pause and look what i wrote uh perhaps they were farming and looks like there was a pestilence coming in a famine flay's rising out of the water and then she begins to walk there's more of these uh creepy uh demons a portal perhaps um as you see again this beast running through the marketplace pay attention to the colors or the those colors were in the church um now we're going to the intro of american gods as we know american gods would be the fallen angels you know uh the main guy in there is called odin um the and is played by uh al pacino but somebody that's well no i forgot his name it's not important but again please i encourage you guys to get involved stop pause zoom in look at the details especially coming up as you see now this these three women now are changing into this transform humanism humanism per se because now they no longer look like women but they have these uh camera like which would be a technology reference and then their skin changes this into this uh cringy demonic looking skin again they're also in a room that is uh filled with triangles now they're looking up with the one eye looking up to the one eye to what would be the true jew that ish um representation of the most high god most indeed hallelujah praise yeah but in the background you see them mixing and combining all the quote-unquote religion the bible's preaches against religion again now uh also please pause stop and look at these uh the tip of each one of these that look like an audio jack again technology reference okay now stop pause and look and tell me what y'all find in those anything significant the first one looks like a microphone on the on the right second you see obviously three um dots which would be the holy and trinity uh unholy unholy hear me not the holy trinity so now on this lady's mask i noticed i stopped and paused and really paid attention and i'm glad i got to redo this because i noticed so much more now check this out guys this is this is really interesting there's a dragon right there on the right and there's a man there in the middle holding up two gates and then there's a portal between two gates on the ground look at the two gates there's a gate there and does it get across where the other finger was and it also looks like it walks into a place now here you'll have a uncompleted pyramid right there on this finished pyramid also there's one right above it to the right side of it very close it's upside down without its finish now you can see it a little bit better and it's kind of interesting um also to me because a lot of these things that i'm seeing here resemble um the inside of what uh phone looks like computer looks like you see now this is an ecstasy pill with the star on it flying into now you see a red and side and a left blue side uh going into making a um eclipse and now as this ecstasy pill flies towards this buddha looking thing um it gets closer and closer as you see now all of a sudden he's lit up and everything's lit up but i guess he's he's higher than the sky he's he's yeah i don't know what he represents so it's kind of creepy then he looks creepy there too now pay attention to this pill please guys look this pill has ice look it says 500 milligram 19 2104 2 000 221 year 2104 can you believe that i want you to stop pausing look please stop pausing look 19 21 we're near 2021 so 2104 would be 202104. hello and as you see this is like a mechanical it looks reminds me a collider now you see these um resembling um where blood would be in those tubes but then also syringes the jab perhaps uh yeah and now they turn to blades which was kind of different and as you see right there in front of you that is the lotus flower that is also in another video that i posted and many have done on the space needle uh washington state ritual mk ultra as you see look now look closely there's a beak on that what once was a buddha now there's no longer a beak there's a cell phone and a trunk in his hand um so yes now there is the the completing of the false trinity boom and now this now everyone is is keen to this black goo it was interesting how this dog which we can also go back to some egyptian things with that but just keep it quick it changes to all black and now you see the red and the black red even darker oh that was kind of like pinkish hmm now you see this woman in bondage i had to look closely because you can see her breasts there and some tying that is transhumanism the combining of machine and man and on the right side you see a uh an animal-like figure and what i noticed here was very interesting was uh yanni stop pause was two cowboys being split in two maybe the the twinning of twenty twenty twin perhaps this cowboy doesn't look like it has a face it looks like it has the skull uh now you see this um very demonic looking hair i mean look at the t look at the eyes look changes colors now they did this color scheme the whole time and what was that and look at that on the wall wow i just caught that now y'all stop pausing and go look at that was on the wall in jesus name get involved brothers and sisters as you see this is a a fallen angel you got the blue and net technology okay with the figure like of a face with no face well lips and eyes and ears and stuff like that uh firearms which we know we're good at farms now we see a giant but they looks like a rocket and our our fast cars um burmest theo has touched on that the mother ship i've touched on that as well as brumus theo uh now look that was that's on the astronaut that is nailed as a mockery to the cross um and what also i find interesting here is why is it that we have a emoji of an astronaut um here also quickly uh you will see ten lights well one and zero would be the on and off the ott um and yeah so um interesting and down here at the bottom as you will continue to look at though it looks like you see like a dragon with two eyes then it kind of like shifts and you see like this i don't know if that's flames or an entity of what but it's quite creepy as you see down there you got your completed um pyramid that looks like a queen mother goddess in the middle the rocket ship that i guess that must have been the rocket ship the queen mother guys because she came from the moon so they wanted to say they went to the moon ah maybe they were already maybe they've been meeting with the with the the the fallens fallen angels the one-third that fell and the great demonic bird at the end the american gods with the big g lord have lord have mercy god bless you all", "j0N8aPVhk_Q": "in addition you are going to discuss some serious issues today it's not such a play playtime we're going to discuss the effects of the Big Pharma pharmaceuticals companies trying to get in the GMOs Monsanto what all is going on a lot of people aren't familiar with what's going on so we're gonna kind of retail some facts and some updates and try to bring uh some awareness to you guys all right so basically guys what we got going on is everybody thinks you know hey man marijuana it's grassroots movement you know the people want this and stuff like that and you know they're kind of right however do it a little bit of digging we come to find out man that the person that's actually well the group of people that are behind the whole marijuana legalization for a world effort pretty much is none other than the Hungarian billionaire George Soros yeah if y'all haven't heard of that guy man that guy's a a really bad man so check him out basically what's going on is from the DA's own website this is at DEA gov forward slash Doc's Ford slash marijuana underscore position on the score two thousand eleven dot PDF on page six the TDA specifically names that movement behind the whole marijuana legalization for recreational and medical use is none other than George Soros Peter Lewis George Zimmer and John Sperling who in 1996 contributed over a million and a half dollars to legalize medical marijuana out fornia which was over 60% of the total contributions y'all and that was and you got that source off of where to get no that's from the deh actual website that's the de a.gov okay you can't make this crap up no another thing that y'all may have not heard about is the drug policy Alliance now George Soros sits on the board of members of that and he actually has funneled eighty million dollars through his other foundation called to promote an open society okay he's funneled money through there to the ACLU so you all know about them people mail watch out for them man they're wolves and sheep yeah wasn't sheep's clothing and the drug policy Alliance now drug policy Alliance and George Soros had a lot to do with the marijuana legalization in Uruguay now what's that happened okay this is a straight quote from George Soros he boasted about playing a crucial role in helping a public education campaign and a big collaboration between government officials the media all big ok activists too so be wary man and he also meant personally with with president Mujica and mihika has made it very clear that he wants a unique genetic code so that he can curve the black market and Uruguay now if you notice he wants a unique genetic code so now that it's completely legal in Uruguay well I don't know if y'all know this or not but George sorro's actually owns six hundred and thirty two thousand shares of the company none other than Monsanto now Monsanto is big at the genetic engineering of foods and seeds they're the world's biggest genetic modifiers seeds and so you can see with the unique genetic code GMO does the cannabis are coming pretty soon man Monsanto has denied it but BOHICA is requesting it now here's the deal Monsanto doesn't even have to technically create a GMO strain of cannabis because Gaea GW Pharmaceuticals in 2009 they claim that they have successfully created the first GMO version of cannabis and have patented it now where that gets really scary it is GW actually has an agreement with the world's largest excuse me the world's largest supplier of seeds which is ahora farm no they have access to all of their cannabis for their research now in 2003 GW Pharmaceuticals had a joint contract no pun intended on cannabis research with the German based company Bayer AG now in 2007 Bayer AG and Monsanto agreed to exchange technologies so as you can see guys right before GW Pharmaceuticals actually created a genetically modified strain of cannabis they actually agreed to exchange information and technology with Monsanto so Monsanto could very well have created a GMO strain of cannabis and said we didn't have anything to do with it because it's under GW Pharmaceuticals know one thing about Monsanto they own Scots Miracle Grow okay now they spent they spent about 130 million dollars Scots Miracle Grow did under Monsanto to buy california-based general hydroponics so if y'all guys are using that to feed your plants cut that out man because you're just feeding the beast man [Music] they've also brought out another company that you may have heard of called bow Tanic hair so boycott those guys Gavita for everybody out there in europe this is a solid based company that makes very very high-end out lighting systems so boycott those guys down with them man chant down Babylon let's see what else do we got let's see where it gets even crazier is you know you have companies like a jian corp monsanto and breed it i don't know if you've ever heard of breed it but these people are doing they're creating genetically modified cannabis okay and now analysts are wondering is cannabis going to be the next GMO crop just like corn and soybeans are now if you don't believe me about the whole you know corporate media the horror prostitution media CNN garbage and these these billionaires made these elitist that want to try to control every aspect of our society man check this out no breed it their scientific adviser his name is alan shackelford okay doctor sorry dr. alan shackelford he's been practicing for about 26 years well he is known around the world by those with his relationship with Sanjay Gupta who is a CNN correspondent with their medical whatever garbage now dr. Charcot is the actual doctor that prescribed the little girl y'all may know as Charlotte Figi with her strain better known to the world as Charlotte's Web he prescribed the drops for her seizures so we can clearly see the infiltration here on Big Pharma GMO trying to step in and create a genetically modified strain that they think is going to be perfect that the people want when it's not what the people want you know I'm saying so people be wary man get into a grow your own stuff if you can't man call up your Congress people man let the people know man we don't want this garbage over here man that's myself what's interesting about this whole of Charlotte's Web thing is that I personally didn't know about that now they've done so well at marketing and they know so much about what's going on that they've kind of sold it all to the to the to the underground communic community as far as growers are concerned I had a guy come out to the San Luis Valley that he grew I want to say upward his higher amount of plant count what Charlotte's Web now what did it do to the plants around that particular area I don't know now I can tell you this there were there were plants in that garden which kinda makes me connect right now I'm making these connections as we speak they were otto flowers they were Otto flower ruderalis bought seeds from somewhere that were put in the garden with this particular strain now they didn't but they didn't but on like it wasn't automatic when a lot of flowers so it did I was tripped out because these plants you know four feet up now more on flower powered with the rest of the crop was it because of the Charlotte's Web I don't know that's what kind of trips me out is that they're probably gonna attack to where we don't we don't we're not going to see it happening yeah which is a big heads up did you talk about see here here's the deal man you got you got there talking about we need a reschedule marijuana we got a reschedule marijuana but if you really think about it man you reschedule marijuana and chop it down to what a level to even a level three or now you got Big Pharma getting in there they're gonna create all new regulations because now it's going to be a quote unquote medicine because of those medical value now right so then you're gonna get everybody that's already in the game growing organically growing it the way that guy created it man and they're gonna get kicked out of the game and who's going to be coming in now man people like GW Pharmaceuticals man bear Monsanto all these people man you know we're going to be coming in here and selling us genetically modified out me because I'm not gonna buy that trash genetically modified marijuana and you don't like that man you know so yellow subscribe to Barker's beautiful but don't be able to grow your own you know so man you just got to be weary man and just think about you know why why do they have a president talking about man that he was smoking weed you know with the last president and trying to make it look cool and everything you know I'm saying and I mean she's gotta think about stuff man I mean it's a trap man somebody's come in here a mere stoner what's up man keep going brother chillin we're smoking yeah yes man I'm trying to bring y'all some real information man real about about these GMOs man trying to creep it into Matar cannabis so that's that's pretty much what I got right now man we'll be doing a lot more digging and stuff and trying to bring a lot more you know you gotta you gotta ask yourself man window you know the government who finds it illegal and is trying to promote cool things about it and stuff like that man kind of start asking yourself man critical thinking what's going on what's going on yeah I think that's a big deal that we got to look at me and they're going to genetically modify it in your acquaintance up right yeah you're going Uruguay so they're gonna this is what's gonna have already got it man in 2009 GW Pharma see it here's the deal is I don't they might it they might have genetically modified something but I don't think they did what they wanted to do just yet yeah I think that's why they took over that country well they're gonna take it over they're going to genetically modify something and then watch what happens man as soon as it happens legalized here watch what happened mm-hmm once they get once they get all their other ducks in a row they're waiting but we're going to fight it to the frontlines we're gonna make sure my stuff is homegrown you know delicious nutritious herbals yeah so that's pretty much what got me up today stay active man you know and stay smoking yellow and as always y'all always remember man god bless man Jah Rastafari", "AVm1Qh3tvlI": "what a gun screw me for your fact on the episode and today I want to talk to you guys about a certain rumor that's going around that Monsanto the genetic modification etic modification organism company is going to be joining the cannabis industry and it's giving some people some worry and I can completely understand that they've they've had a bad rap in the past and it's quite worrisome that they're going to be joining the cannabis industry with their technology but there could be some good points could be some bad points so let's just go over what what they're talking about they're going to be bringing bringing in to use a fairly new technology called RNA I which is ribonucleic acid interference now essentially what this is is they're going to be playing with the genetics of canvas and they said they can go all the way from changing the color of the plant all the way to making it into Jess table for insects or some pests just like they've done with their roundup and there are patented seeds that gives me some real worry the other not so much but let's keep in mind that for centuries we've been genetically modified modifying our own canvas even the even the canvas I'm smoking right now it's it's a hybrid it's a cross between a sativa and an Inuk indica so it can get both desirable traits even furthermore you could cross it with a ruderalis and that would make it Otto flower and breeders are also bringing plants into artificial environments such as hydroponics using bigger lights to induce more THC production and so on and so forth and they're even even some are using plant growth regulators so let's just let's just stay on the wall about them hopefully they won't totally [ __ ] up our plant and remember that this is our plant the cannabis community has control over what's going to happen within legalization because we are the consumers we are the producers we are the heart of the cannabis community so we have a say in this now here's a great idea if we're all worried about the contamination of genetic modifications in our seeds why don't we all band together worldwide and start a genetic seed bank for cannabis it would essentially be like a library of every single strain known to man and that way it could be quarantined away from all of the doings of Monsanto or any other companies that are going to be going into our nai technology and if they further patent those those strains well that's even better we have our own quarantine stash and also we can vote with our tax dollars if Monsanto weed ever gets into your dispensary simple as that don't buy it so we're not feeding to the company so we just gotta keep in mind that this is one small aspect of legalization that other bigger companies are going to be looking into cannabis for profit now we are always going to be the victors no matter what they can they can profit all month all they want but as long as it's legal and nobody's getting thrown in jail for growing a plank in their backyard that's awesome because that's the point of legalization to end the stupidity of throwing people away in jail for wasting money incriminate in people and that's what we gotta do and we also got a state stand on the wall and informed about any companies joining into the cannabis industry so I hope you guys found this video informational hope you enjoyed it never good day guys these stay medicated stand you gated [Applause]", "pHCWzmswrcc": "all right for all my weed smokers Monsanto and Bayer maneuvers to take over the cannabis industry Monsanto the data that they well-known for the constant genetic tampering with food industry's corn and soy in particular the corporate giant has set its eyes on another area cannabis the ganja tweaking we know and love may soon be a shadow of the beautiful plant we became so well acquainted with in high school this is insane let's see history back history of that okay Monsanto and miracle-gro have a business partnership Hawthorne a front for Miracle Grow has already bought three of the biggest King canna heads in in the business botanic heir Kavita and general hydroponics many other companies have also received offers of buyouts but refused they want to bypass hydroponics retail stores when we say we won't get in bed with them they say well we could just buy your whole company like we did with Kavita and do whatever we want said a hydroponics Lightning representative Miracle Grow CEO has gone so far as to announce his plans for reefer referendums to invest like half a billion in taking over the pot business it is the biggest thing I've ever seen in a lawn and garden Monsanto and Bayer share information about genetically modifying crops they are partners with GW Pharmaceuticals which grows its own proprietary metal marijuana genetics it's logical to conclude that Monsanto and Bayer wants to create GMO marijuana I will put a link in the description box but this is uh this is bad or so they're gonna keep they're gonna give you these crazy super strains of weed like and they're gonna be GMO weeds and also it's not gonna be in the long run healthy for you and this is another way to help kill off hordes of population because there's a lot of smokers that indulge and cannabis this is not good for you guys all right have a good one you", "BZqvbNVydJI": "Hey welcome to the night reality it's like super here today I got a story I mean it's kind of oldest from June 27th of 2017 it says my tanto and bear are maneuvering to take over the cannabis industry we knew that Canada's industry would boom once it started getting legalized and they seemed the the positives about the plant you know I could cure well it's can't i I don't think you cure anything but it definitely helps with people with Parkinson's people with other problems it's it's just a really good natural remedy for a lot of ailments like for pain it reduces depression and increases appetite and stuff like that and Monsanto Monsanto yeah they're looking to take over the industry and let's see uh it's been rumored for years that Monsanto plans to take over the candidates in this industry with genetic engineering just as they've taken over the corn and soy industries although they have always denied having any intentions to do so at this point it is unlikely that anybody really believes them nobody believes them and nobody ever has believed them because they've gotten caught with their hand in the cookie jar on more than one time in contrast many in the cannabis sphere why don't why is it sphere is it many in the cannabis world I prepared to resist any kind of GMO takeover of marijuana by a Monsanto or any of their cohorts that's why they put spear name just because everyone's talking about the Flat Earth so it should be the cannabis world evidence is mounting though which points to strong roots points strongly to the notion that Monsanto does indeed plan to take control of cannabis plant and it doesn't look good for medical users or any planning on getting into the industry Bayer yeah Bayer bars out Monsanto for sixty six billion dollars sixty six mmm they won't thrown their numbers in there 66 alright you may remember hearing back in September that bear the largest pharmaceutical company in the world big big big big super huge formal made a deal to buy out Monsanto for sixty six billion although Monsanto was voted the most evil company in the world in 2013 and its reputation has continued to fall since bears still went ahead with the buyout you know why because Monsanto is so deeply and funded and everything by the government's and all the other agencies stats are supposed to be looking out for well-being but really don't care all they're just lining everybody's pockets said Monsanto and miracle girl have an intimate business ties call it too big butts magazine Monsanto and Scott's miracle girl have a deep business partnership and plan on taking over the cannabis industry Hawthorne a front groups for Scott's has already purchased three major cannabis growing companies general hydroponics botanic hair Inga Vita many other hydroponics companies have also reported attempted buyouts by Hawthorn I hope they don't sell out since they want to buy these hydro partners they want to bypass hydroponics retail stores when we said we won't get in bed with him they said well we could just go buy your whole company like we did would get their Gavita and do whatever you want hydroponics lighting representative said so basically if you're not gonna work with them you're just gonna buy you out and take you over yeah that's American that's America at its finest if you won't help us we'll just buy you out and do what we want with your company said Jim Hager dawn of CEO of scotch miracle girl has even said that the plants to or the plans to invest like half a billion taking over the pot business is the biggest thing I've ever seen in long garden he also invested in companies such as leaf Grove which grows cannabis in an electronically regulated indoor terrarium accessible via smartphone I like doing take a look at that Bayer and Monsanto trade industry secrets on producing GMO marijuana is it logical that Bayer being the parent company would work together with my tanto in order to share secrets which would advance mutual business many people in the cannabis industry have been warning about this including Michael straw medias Sur straw mitis founder and an owner of advanced nutrition and nutrients Monsanto and been sharing information about it genetically modifying crops strim itis notes Bayer partners with GW Pharmaceuticals which grows its own proprietary mare a lot of genetics it's logical to conclude that Monsanto and Bayer want to create GMO marijuana michael strim it\u00eds so the conclusion here is it possible that Bayer and Monsanto could create a monopoly on marijuana seeds the same way that they have created a monopoly on corn and soy most definitely and it will be most insane because back in the day that's why the main marijuana or hemp illegal because it was competing with the big paper mills the logging industry so they made it illegal they made it Oh if you smoke it you'll lose your mind or whatever but they never I realized how much cheaper it would be to produce paper with ham for these clothing could his rope produce soaps and stuff pretty like cures like pain relief products so though the immense corporate power and the enforcement of the international patent law these corporations could place themselves in a position of total control over cannabis as a medicine as well as for recreational use by using the same model as they do with food and crops take control isn't that it that sounds it's so nice to hear this but not all hope is lost there's still a chance to fight back against a bear Monsanto monopoly by boycotting genetically engineered products man the American people are so lazy they can't boycott [ __ ] they're SEPA man they just they wants to mean you know watch the mainstream and just regurgitate it's it's just it's disgusting how our society is today miracle-gro another Scott brand products a beta for pharmaceuticals and companies that do business with any of these so you should boycott all of that you could even you could even store seeds if you live in an area where it is legal and grow your own while supporting hydroponics and nutria companies that don't do business with these corporate behemoth corporations and people with hundreds of billions of dollars no marijuana is a miracle plant they want to come in and steal our plant seeds industry from us and we must stop to him yeah we must me because they've done it at every turn that could get with any other theme was any other thing that was good for us even our food mainly they started genetically like Franken corn I mean there's just it's stuff that it carries its own pesticide in the corn I mean it's supposedly safe for us but look at everybody getting sick look at all all just the sickness that's going around man on I don't know let me know what you guys think in the comments below I'm strongly against any type of monsanto bayer combination I hope they don't buy them all but it looks like they may have already I don't know let me know what you guys think in the comments let me know what you think this

the foul bread among the Gentiles wearing I will drive down well a new report finds popular breakfast foods and cereals marketed to children contain a weed killing chemical some health experts linked that chemical to cancer our legend a show says that research discovered trace amounts in oats granolas and snack bars sin honey cut heads moms across America a group formed to raise awareness about toxic exposures her family switched to an organic only diet after her three sons developed allergies and other health problems we want to trust that what is in the grocery store is safe the nonprofit environmental working group or ewg had a lab test of 45 samples of products made with conventionally grown oats and they found glyphosate the active ingredient in the monsanto weed killer roundup in all but two I was shocked dr. Jennifer Lowry heads the Council on Environmental Health for the American Academy of Pediatrics we don't know a lot about the effects of glyphosate on children ewg used its own more stringent standards to conclude that products with excessive levels of the herbicide included Quaker old fashioned oats Cheerios Quaker dinosaur egg instant oats great value instant oats and back to nature classic granola clusters glyphosate was even found in a few organic products though most had non detectable levels the World Health Organization says glyphosate is a probable carcinogen state of California lists it as a chemical known to the state to cause cancer Monsanto disputes that saying a statement glyphosate does not cause cancer and has more than a 40 year history of safe use and Monsanto criticized DW G's research saying even at the highest levels reported an adult would have to eat a hundred and eighteen pounds of the food item every day for the rest of their life in order to reach the EPA's limit we don't think it does enough in particular to protect children Alan janae CBS 4 News a CBS reached out to the maker of those products in a statement Quaker said we proudly stand by the safety and quality of Quaker products any level of glyphosate that may remain are significantly below any limits of the safety standards set by the EPA and General Mills told us our products are safe and without question they meet regulatory safety levels the EPA has researched this issue and has set the rules that we follow this is a call for an uprising welcome to today's show well that video shouldn't surprise anyone who is awake we all know what Monsanto is and what Monsanto is doing to us I'm pretty surprised it actually made the news it's kind of shocking in a way I wonder if the person who produced that piece is alive at this moment knowing Monsanto who they're connected to and what their goal is but what a surprise that we would find weed killer now included in some food like Cheerios what a shock right and people wonder how all these diseases continue to just grow right like everyone's getting cancer everywhere you turn you see cancer walks you see all of the everybody wearing pink for breast cancer awareness even though we're all aware how about we cure it well they have the cure you see they just don't release the cure to the people out there because they don't want them to know that they're actually the ones who are poisoning everyone but you know what they'll do no blame cancer on God don't blame autism on God they'll blame all these diseases on God meanwhile they're the ones who are putting poison and aluminum and weed killer in our food when does it stop when do people start going this is unbelievable who is Monsanto why are they doing this and that Monsanto comes out and they defend it and they say it doesn't cause cancer ok so let's all go eat eat weed killer because it doesn't cause cancer Monsanto says it's safe to consume weed killer dozens of common breakfast cereals and snack bars have found trace amounts of the controversial herbicide found in the weed killer roundup according to a report released today by environmental advocacy group the ewg found that 26 of the 28 products attested at levels of randoms main ingredient which is glyphosate I hope I'm pronouncing that right but that were higher than what ewg scientists consider protective of children's health manufactures say and what a surprise to write that they're targeting kids foods is that a surprise they'll be targeting kids foods unbelievable this is just but this is just Bale worship right because remember I know everybody thinks it's like that you know this has any kind of sacrifices like oh it's got to be in a ritual and it's got to be you know eat they've got to go through all this stuff they all these things count to them the ones who are putting the doing this to us and kidding the diseases and excuse me putting the chemicals in our food and when people get cancer so they count those as ritual offerings think about it manufacturers say their products are safe with the ewg report argues that the vast majority of foods test is such as honey nut cheerios Quaker simply granola oats have the glyphosate levels that might pose a cancer risk with long-term consumption none of the foods violated EPA limits on the herbicide but the ewg uses a far more conservative health benchmark California's proposed glyphosate limit which would be the most restrictive in the country still allows for glyphosate levels that are over a hundred times higher than the ewg threshold why why is it even allowed period even if there's a root you know even if there's this small slightest chance that this thing could cause cancer why would it be in our food why like I said a million times go look at the side of a box of Cheerios right there whole-grain oats right and then you look at the size of box you're like ok I guess there's some whole-grain oats and oats and wheat or whatever and it's like Slav lush lack of late Floss fool good luck poopa do paddy and people here okay it must be safe to eat since they allow us to eat it because we have to trust in the FDA and our government that they would give us the right things because God for who they don't anyone get sick you know they don't want the pharmaceutical companies to you know to make all this money and healthcare to make all this money no they want us all healthy and active the only time they're gonna promote all of us being healthy and how we can all you know there's no diseases anymore this is the Cure because obviously they're doing this to everybody is when the transhumanist agenda hits its 100% mark when it's ready to go and they're ready to have everybody take the chip and the mark and become transhuman they'll say listen when you have this computer inside you you you don't get sick anymore but people out there they just hear this and they're like oh it's not going well what the hell what the hell is the problem why are they doing this why are these chemicals that would even why would something like this that you came for pronounce what does it have to do with anything that would have be in the food Oh weed killer yeah let's just dump some more weed killer in our Quaker Oats what's next why don't you just put rat poison on the side of the box right go get some Wonder Bread right it's got rat poison but don't worry it still tastes wonderful right Johnny yep sure does mom right put some propaganda commercials out there they call of us crazy nut jobs boy it says manufacturers are disputing the threshold of course they are because I mean because they would lose money on General Mills who spend they would lose these people would have be buying their products period they ban them for life but you know there's enough fluoride in the water that people don't even care when they hear stuff like this they're like I guess I'll go have Cheerios anyway because I'm not gonna get cancer today so I might as well have it and then when they get cancer in a few years they blame it on God instead of blaming it on what these people are putting in our food and dumping us dumping in our air with the chemtrails and the vaccinations General Mills whose products were also cited in the report maintain that the glyphosate levels and it's foods do not pose any health risks huh the extremely low levels of pesticide residue yeah because you know when the guy comes to spraying with pesticides it's not like he's spraying a chemical oh wait he is spraying a chemical but why not eat the pesticides right so next time that guy comes with pesticides why don't you just go outside and open your mouth and say spray something he'd say no he can't spray pesticide you'll die oh but the it's okay to have extremely low levels of pesticide residue cited in our in our food oh my goodness and they say in the news report a tiny fraction the amount that the government allows what other government allow any of it what we know why right why would they target kids you know they talk about this herbicide manufacturer order to pay seventy eight million to a cancer victim don't know how true that is because this stuff net these guys well listen we know they print money money's not a concern for them really or at least the people at the top but I mean let's just let's look at this rationally what should this be in our food whether it's high levels low levels any level why would this be in our food why would they be saying that there's pesticides and weed killer in our food and people going yeah whatever right because the government goes well it won't kill yeah you know people are like oh okay yeah well might I'll kill you instantly but it'll kill you in the long run they won't tell you that they'll just go well you're not gonna eat Cheerios and then get cancer today because the levels are real low but what if somebody eats Cheerios every single day what if somebody's having Quaker Oats every morning for five to ten years especially a child oh yeah that's gonna do wonders for their body having a little pesticide a little glop of slate whatever the crap is it's gonna do what a little weed killer here I mean what's next really what what's next that they're gonna admit that they put it in the food it's really kind of a funny question right I think I'm out of admit that they just put an aluminum in everything right and the soft metals they put in our mouth with our you know the reason that our teeth rot and we get all these teeth problems these are all the crap and the food and they've got no no no it's not that oh then how come so many people if the fluoride helps in the water why do so many people have teeth problems alright because everyone's drinking water every day and they're claiming they put fluoride in everything to help us I don't know about you but I've gone to the dentist my fair share of times we all have with cavities tooth pains the older it's just like man my tooth hurts Oh what could be Oh Chris I'm putting soft I'm putting all this garbage in my mouth I'm eating weed killer that helps my teeth and you know it gives me cancer too in the long run so poor the Cheerios dad fill me up with some of that Quaker Oats 20 years from now and I have cancer I'll just blame it on God not on my government because that's easier inconvenient that's what all these people do right absolute joke it's just an absolute joke so I wanted to point that out to people you know there should be an uprising against this kinda stuff the FDA is the most corrupt you know I know this well you have the CIA the FBI and the FDA and you have all these secret organizations and then you have all these front organizations that act like they have our you know best interest at hand yeah the FDA's got our best interests at hand when they go a little weed killer won't hurt you yeah if you only ask you the listener if you had you if you were the head of the FDA and someone came into your office and everything was you know on your reputation and they came in and said well we found some weed killer in the you know and the Cheerios a big deal which respect net signed a big deal or you said yeah it's a big deal because people find out putting we killer in there I'm gonna lose my job people are gonna get sick I don't want blood on my hands but it doesn't work that way because they want this crap in our food and they know that they can even release stories like this and no one cares and Monsanto can come out and say we know what's best use our dirt use our seed only us wonder why months and we're all forced with Monsanto boy and people think we're all conspiracy nuts they are so dumb it's unbelievable I thank you

I think this is a good thing because you know it's been a long time you know it's been a long time fighting this battle to get marrow to get medical marijuana legalized in illinois and i think it's good but at the same time you know it's always gonna be bad because it's not for recreational use and you cannot cut to be any plants in your house that's what the law say no I'm sound like like California do they can do up to 24 plants some light though I'm not for sure I'm not a resident mcallen fire I'm some arrest in the Illinois so of course I'm gonna look up one resident from so I'm going to get bad and ugly so basically medical marijuana has been officially legalized in Illinois I think yesterday or the day before yesterday all official sales will start this monday coming up which is the knife so if you are qualified patient you can go buy your medical marijuana out of dispensary on this coming Monday which is the knife so some facts I got about this stuff you know more than 3,000 patients we be able to buy medical marijuana Monday no it's aight license dispensaries in Illinois and I'm gonna give names and locations of where these dispensaries are located oh yes and it is a lot of jobs for medical marijuana now and this is [ __ ] great you know you could be a budtender you could be all type of [ __ ] no I'm not gonna say I know all the names i just know bud tender that seemed like the funnest job no cash sure you know all that touch it but it could be a blow it true I know how your diplomas initiative so you know I'm gonna get my [ __ ] cuz I want to do this but anyway these are the eight locations for heat especially but fortunately is Marion Illinois so if you look out there you'll qualify patient get to smoke on cuz another one is I don't know if i'ma say this right but it's mine DeLeon Illinois that's the second one Canton Illinois Quincy Illinois Addison Illinois north aurora in schaumburg illinois other water I mean I don't lie or what I have you pronounce the Illinois so the eight dispensaries are in those you know in those eight counties you know so if you go to any one of those Chinese go ahead go crazy you know any one of those cities whatever the [ __ ] you know what I'm talking about and I didn't write down the whole list for each disease or each given as you have like basically I didn't write down each illness that you need to have just to get medical marijuana only roll down the key few the basic ones that everybody know but it's some on there that you could probably qualify for like I'm gonna give you just a couple so those the ones i have is cancer lupus hepatitis e glaucoma ALS must have not these make the main ones but these are like the main man made diseases you know himself you ain't got none of these are the other big word [ __ ] i can't pronounce you don't go to them you might not get a profile for medical marijuana and then if you do pop/rock marijuana you need to scan your finger prayer you need signed documentation from your doctor and you have to have an ongoing relationship with your doctor for some years have to be like more than two or three years you know so you just came walking in and get it but this is Illinois so anything is possible but I just want to say this is so good this is so great for the state cuz it's like they give them the people that they won't like come on people want to smoke weed and people are going to smoke weed regardless you know I'm saying salute is not a time to they did this so Thank You governor powder [ __ ] funny thank you for legalizing this plant is just a plant and I'm going to give you some of the ugly now you should know this they have this thing called GMO weed yes and so what I know if they run out of real organic we did they have grown if they run out then they will start giving you the patent gmob from the government Colorado did it California did it you know so they probably still do it that's only if they run out of organic meat I'm just telling you the truth so if you know what you're smoking so this is good man you know there's a good lot of jobs have opened up which is wonderful you know my people that's actually hitting pain actually need this medical marijuana that's good for them to you know I'm saying could they need something he's a pain my father's don't want to take pills all day so it's like everybody went in basically you know I'm saying its own enough that will let us cultivate in our houses in peace and sewn enough it will legalize this for recreational use so you know I'm so this is good for the state so smoke up", "fYxjlLpM72k": "this is one thing I was afraid of Monsanto getting involved with marijuana for those of you that smoke or eat or drink or whatever ingest cannabis period in any way shape or form or whatever reason didn't this cross your mind it did to me at first but because we are so overwhelmed with input whether it be news entertainment sports whatever there's so much they throw at us stuff like this comes and goes and we forget I had a feeling something was going to happen concerning when this country for the first time in 40 years gave a second look at the demand that the public wanted concerning marijuana or cannabis whatever when this government responded in a not a positive way but in a well ok let's talk about it and I knew I knew something is up because my entire life and guys a lot of you have seen that absurd propaganda movie produced and directed by our loving government I went in black-and-white whatever it's called do you've seen it probably I've seen an artist can't remember the name right now marijuana madness or something who knows anyways save your seeds save your seeds Monsanto is going to get involved they're gonna completely destroy this plant they're going to make it to where they do to farmers now a one-time-only seed meaning you plant it it grows it produces GMO fruit vegetable whatever and then that's it it's over you have to go back to Monsanto and buy more seeds okay when you're talking 1015 seeds big deal but when you're talking 10 or 15 tons of seed for a farm like corn or cotton or soybeans or whatever then you're talking a tremendous amount of money and you're talking a tremendous amount of messing around with the natural by Monsanto that is natural after they get their hands on it who knows what we don't look like but save your seeds do not do not let anyone you know in the future and I think it's going to take probably five years if we're still around for Monsanto to completely take over the obvious marijuana world okay and by that I mean you know dispensaries and Colorado and Washington or supposedly it's legal but only in your bath after midnight where the lights turned off in other words kind of like we used to do it anyways I mean ice to just get on my roof I didn't give a [ __ ] about whatever anyways this pisses me off because first of all they're telling you you know don't use it you'll kill your parents you'll rape your sister your mouse your dog and on and on and now all of a sudden it's a wonder plant and there's so many great medicinal qualities to it if we could only separate these bad THC chemicals from the good THC chemicals and that's [ __ ] because it's all good so save your seeds guys because you do not want Monsanto marijuana in your body

genes placing you know I'm saying I made videos about this but I've really been dab and I've really been diving depth with the topic you see them soon so I'm just gonna make this a little short topic so you know I'm just gonna touch on a few points about gene splicing now genius bison is pretty much like cloning should it is cloning really if you want to get technical but uh genius places this is real this exists this is going on right in front of your face you see I'm saying James pison is pretty much in my opinion it's GMO products you see them self good the world we live in now everything is GMO not everything but 95% of everything in this world is GMO real [ __ ] it's a shortage on real things that's just what it is we this GMO a lot of women is GMO a lot of men out here a GMO a lot of jobs out here at GMO the airs GMO you know I'm saying to close out GMO and I'm gonna exhale I'm gonna tell you what I mean by that I'm saying it's just a lot of people had just GMO you know it's just a lot of things now the movie splice yeah so I'm pretty sure if you haven't seen a movie go look it up another alien there was one ugly [ __ ] but real talk though the movie splice they was telling you know I think came out 2008 some [ __ ] like that seen a movie about full times they was telling you that they splicing genes they take they take a certain chromosome or a certain genetic from alien I think it's hurting chromosome genetic from human mix that [ __ ] together in the laboratory and they can birth some type of creation I call it a domination because that's not natural that's not nature that's not god-sent that's something that the devil would do see the devil he did he Devils and danced with gene splicing and things their nature now but just like I said just a touch on a couple topics see gene splicing they doing that the government is doing that with a lot of fruits and vegetables they know the conscious community is waking up you know a lot of people are just waking up in general and they know that they want to stop your DNA because that's they hold plans to stop the DNA from upgrade because that's what we in the process of DNA upgrade I'm saying real talk and when your DNA upgrades like I said you start remember your past lives you know certain abilities and things of that nature some of this stuff may be far-fetched to some people I said go to Disney Channel you see him saying explain keeping you the real truth and a lot of people starting to see the real truth I'm saying but gene splicing in sunlight with apples if your apples oranges grapes bananas pineapples and gas seeds is GMO I mean it has been spliced realtalk that means like for Apple for example it was a story and then went even on the news there was a story there was a in the media you know saying like I was telling people people say Trump bad he might be a bad person but he gonna pass some good laws to help people but those laws not gonna be broadcasted that's the [ __ ] you got to be your research and look for real [ __ ] Obama did the same thing all this stuff like the homosexuality you know they're they gonna broadcast it ain't [ __ ] they gonna broadcast if ever shaken they wanting to be distracted anyone should look at the negative stuff but he passes a good laws real talk but you have to look for it you have to do your research real talk you're not gonna just give you the good stuff you have to look forward now they it was a story about the government was splicing apples with spider DNA real talks to them you bite into an apple you know I'm saying I'm not gonna handle seeds and I mean that [ __ ] my potty looked a little bit nasty and inside that's because that's Apple mr. spider DNA meaning they took some samples from a spider and they took some samples from an apple like a real Apple and they try to do some [ __ ] to it genetically modified you know genetically modified organisms and boom they grew Apple but it's not a regular Apple just like what the UH what they call it snow white yes no way when their lady hit their the low which hit that perfect looking Apple would look so red and beautiful but that was poison that's pretty much like splicing you know I'm saying yeah that's what they doing out here they take you know different DNA and different things from different entities and different organism may mix them together like for example like I love this McDonald's and [ __ ] out here this [ __ ] is spliced food you like for example they could take a rat's head do something in the laboratory and they could grow it to make it like a potato but really you just eaten our getting spliced potato is mixed with rat DNA and real potato DNA real [ __ ] so you know no but you're eating you know I'm saying so I guess I just want to touch on this topic let you know that a lot of stuff is GMO like the weed I'm Sam my lashes spliced - they could take a lot of a lot of these young people are happy even no seeds I'm on my way with no seeds first things first you stupid idiot if we come from a seed doesn't it supposed to produce seeds if an apple comes from a seed there's knispel to produce seeds duh so if you smoke it's on Mangano seeds then you smoke us on genetically modify our weed really they can splice the we where they could take some we make it takes we chromosomes and they could take the [ __ ] they could take some [ __ ] like I'm just give me example they could take some [ __ ] from a dinosaur some [ __ ] nah that's too far effects they could take some [ __ ] from a cat I'm saying some DNA from a cat DNA from a weave they created - we call cat piss and you wonder why you be jumping around and tweaking you so you smoke it because you're smoking some spicy sweet you understand what I'm saying so I want to touch on this topic I remember a lot of stuff out here you smoking evening [ __ ] ain't real I'm saying there's a lot of gene splicing going on bro - that's when you get a lot of these mutated creatures from yeah they spicing these [ __ ] they take some human DNA they might want I say for example a female who got a long beautiful blonde here they may want that genetic so they don't take that genetic from that girl and they gonna take a genetic from a monster type being and then gonna put it together and boom just like the movie splice we gonna come up with some ugly-ass monster is you know beast abomination yeah I'm saying this [ __ ] is real this is like Frankenstein Frankenstein with gene-spliced that's the perfect example of gene splicing dr. Jekyll will see dogs hair real tongues to wake the damn universe wanted to touch on this be just a little bit you know I'm saying they sit in real", "8pubhtU-X54": "hello everyone it is my cleaning night at centre here so I will be quickly off to scrub some toilets but I was reading a article an article briefly before I was about to scoot down there about Monsanto has just a patented a genetically modified marijuana plant marijuana strain and a lot of things of course popped into my head initially it was oh why the [ __ ] does Monsanto get to do that when other small companies are doing genetic research mostly through growth of the classic not the the high science highly scientific Monsanto version as I don't like Monsanto genetic modification fantastic do it to it make the best plant that mother nature could never even have imagined great Monsanto on the other hand our [ __ ] and they want to patent and own and and just be the shitty one the giant corporation everyone hates the giant corporation Monsanto is the giant corporation so I I hate Monsanto but I like the the genetic modification the upgrades making things logically better in a way that Mother Nature didn't care to it didn't have a care because it doesn't so a conscious thought some conscious some intelligent design into plants I think is is the way to go and another thought was why the [ __ ] is indeed the DEA busting Monsanto for dealing with a legal and illegal substance why do they get away with it the answer is obvious billions of dollars of course you can't arrest people in suits and lab coats in a billion dollar industry that has paid there were their lobbyists have paid millions upon millions of dollars to write the laws and pay off the Mafia is essentially what Monsanto has done they've paid off the Mafia so they get exclusive rights to do whatever the hell they want to to any other substance I'm wondering and another thought was I'm kind of scrambled with this one I've got so much going on I made a couple of comments on Facebook and it wasn't enough for me it got me to thinking what if Monsanto had patented a more effective heroin or a a better cocaine or a less a less damaging crystal meth how about that one a crystal meth that's actually not damaging it's it's changed the molecule so that it you know it doesn't cause overdoses anymore so you can take as much as you want with the DEA at that point be okay with it I'm actually betting they would and it's probably going to go that direction monsanto genetically engineered magic mushrooms for for the better for better psychologists so it's a mixed bag for me the the other other hand is that i am thrilled that a large or a mega corporation is willing to put it out there it has now decided that they're going to go there i say against the pharmaceutical lobbyists because the pharmaceutical industry does not want marijuana they are I will replace 80% I'm gonna be generous to the pharmaceutical companies cannabis will replace 80% of their drugs right out of the right out of the plant right out of the box you're gonna pick the plant eat it and you won't need 90 percent of their drugs and I don't want to knock the pharmaceutical companies completely because a lot of their drugs help people there are people that have weird issues that marijuana wouldn't necessarily address off the top my head I can't think of which ones those are but I'm sure there are so I don't want to knock the pharmaceutical companies it's it's when when they use their power and corruption to prevent other medicine from helping people's because they want to make a buck and then you get this opposite I suppose this is the happy part you get another giant make a corporation that wants to do the same thing but they suddenly have opposing goals so they're going to cancel each other out I suppose so uh I'm in favor of it I wish it wasn't Monsanto I wish it didn't have to be Monsanto to get away with it I wish a smaller company could have done it I wish the growers that are already doing it in legal states because it would probably have to be a legal skate state even though months and I didn't have to monsanto didn't have to be in a legal state to get their patent and do their experiments so it kind of bugs me so I wish wish growers that were already doing it had the sway that Monsanto would with the government but all in all I think it's gonna be a good thing even with the evil Monsanto patenting everything it's weed I mean really how much can they patent I'm mixed I'm going to see the good side in this and and just see it as Monsanto pushing legalization even faster and and pushing our ability to just use cannabis the way we see fit with the dark kind of cloud of Monsanto I suppose were or summoning the demon here it's it's it's helping us well well we've got the pentagram painted around it but it's going to do everything it can to erase that pentagram and come at our throats kind of a weird analogy oh well I'm gonna go scrub toilets peace"}
