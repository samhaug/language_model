{"IK_s4pBJkMs": "hey tony you ready to film rain you ready to film okay we're gonna film hey everyone this is lauren mr flabs today i just want to talk to you about health clearances so what are health clearances they are basically health tests that the parent club which is the national club for your specific breed so in this case we're talking about the labrador retriever club of america or as affectionately as it's called the lrc and what it is is they dictate what the minimum required and optional tests are that responsible breeders should be testing all of their breeding stock for so today i wanted to go over that with you and just kind of break down what you should be looking for when looking to purchase a puppy or an adult dog for that matter but what you should be asking your breeder about and what they test for for their dogs the purpose of health testing is to limit the known genetic conditions that are inherited in your specific breed so my goal for you is to get a dog from a credible responsible breeder that the sole purpose of their breeding program is not to make money but to better the breed and that is the whole idea behind a dog show and breeding so i'm also going to put a link to all of these websites in the notes so you have a resource as a buyer that you can go and look up more information about each of these health tests um each of why we help test for them or why they're tested and sorry i got distracted by tony he's opening up his crate door that was cute according to the lrc these are in the lrc's labrador retriever club of america these are the minimum necessary health clearances that are expected from reputable breeders those are required to get a chick or a chick number i've never i've heard it pronounced a couple different times it me it's an acronym for canine health information center which is a program that is put on um i don't know who actually runs it it's like a non-profit maybe i don't know anyway i should know but i don't know but it's a program basically to help breeders breed better dogs so it's you get a chic number or chick number whatever it's called um and that's basically saying hey my dog passes all the necessary health clearances for that breed these are the ones we're going to go over um the minimum that you should be looking for as a buyer so the websites i'm going to be referring to are ofa which is the orthopedic foundation for animals it's a registry where you when you have your test done you can register them with this registry and it's uh visible so anybody can look it up so i can even show you right now page on the ofa website so here is her registration number breed sex color birthday and then her siren dance registration numbers i do not have a chic number for her because i did not submit her dilute and eic status um to ofa so that is optional that breeders can do i believe maybe half of do give or take and then below are um her test results that i have submitted to ofa so here is the number that's associated with each test and its results here is each test test day report day the age in which she was tested and the final conclusion or results of that test and then down below are you can go through and click through all of these and see the results for her parents as well so and grandparents and half siblings so when researching a dog this is a great website to see what the back history is of different pedigrees and relatives of the dog that you are hoping to get so use of a as a resource it definitely is a great database to look up health screenings for your future pet the minimum requirements that the labrador retriever club aka lrc requires of every reputable breeder for labradors and that is field labs confirmation labs labs just akc registered labradors you guys i took notes so here we are uh ofa hip dysplasia is the first test so hip dysplasia has been a problem in labradors for a long time um it's actually through testing it's been decreased or the frequency has decreased dramatically in labs i'm not saying that it doesn't happen but it's far less than it used to be so um general rule you ofa is uh orthopedic foundation for animals link to the website below and you get hip x-rays done at two years old for any breeding stock dog you only have to do this once some people will test their dog at like a year year and a half old to see how they're doing whether they're going to keep the dog or not um but they still have to do the final of a hip x-ray exam at two years old the passing grades are fair good and excellent you really want good or excellent um if they're dysplastic the grades are either well there's mild moderate and severe and then there's also a borderline grading that is technically a fail i've never seen a borderline but i'm sure they're out there um in addition for labs there's also ofa elbows this again is a one-time test that you do um for a final grade at two years old elbow dysplasia is common in labs so again it's a pass fail and you either pass and there's no other extra green you just pass or if you fail there are grades and there are one through three in severity so two years old you do both hips and elbows that's what you look for and every dog that you the parents of your dog that you're going to buy should have passing grades just as a rule of thumb next is another minimum for the lrc is an eye exam so this is a yearly test that should be done on all breeding stock dogs so in this exam is by a board ophthalmologist dog ophthalmologist and this needs to be done yearly so the dog's eyes are dilated and um they've gone through different exams that i don't know the technical names for because i hate eyes and i don't like watching it so anyway but um should be done yearly a genetic test should be done for a um inherited disease called eic or exercise induced collapse um this is also a one-time test that is a genetic test and you can do this super early like an eight week old puppy or um later on the last one that is required for a chick um number is the d-locus dilute genetic test so what this is is i'm not sure if you've ever heard of this but a silver labrador is not a labrador it is a mix and the dilute gene is associated with that silver coloring um so the labrador retriever club of america is really trying to not have this dilute gene in the gene pool because it's not truly a lab and i'm not going to get into that whole discussion but lab's going to come in three colors yellow which is varies in shade from red to very light yellow like a cream color brown aka chocolate and black that's it there's no more so um those are the core five five tests that require by the very minimum that the labrador retriever club of america requires of a reputable breeder now most breeders aka just about everybody who breeds and shows does a bunch of different tests in addition to it because it's the responsible thing to do these are not just only um health issues and labradors there's way more so we're going to go over some optional ones and what they recommend and i'm also going to tell you a couple other ones that are available um through the testing sites so first optional is centronuclear myelopathy myopathy not myelopathy myopathy aka cnmcnm so it's a dna test so you're gonna do it you're gonna um test for it once and it is a inherited disease that has an early onset of muscular problems so optional test number two which i am shocked that this isn't a mandatory test to be frank like you should be doing this i mean you should be doing the other one on the cnn one too but you really should be testing the hearts of your dogs so a cardiac evaluation is um they had they had different things listed for me females versus males my opinion you should be getting echocardiogram done minimum age is one year old there's an echo there's also um a test which is oscillation where they the veterinarian just listens with a stethoscope so i would get the echo done but that's just me so moving on or another optional test is uh the pra prcd which is um this is also a genetic test that can be done um dna test and it is progressive rod cone degeneration and it's an inherited form of late onset progressive retinal atrophy aka pra so this is basically your dog goes blind over time um it's inherited in labs again you can test for this gene so the cnm the cardiac test and the pra test are three optional tests that the lrc recommends um it doesn't require doesn't require it as a mandated for responsible breeders but it's optional i think it's should be mandatory but that's just me so in addition so if you go and get a dog from a breeder they're going to have most they're going to have all these done so a good a good reputable labrador retriever breeder will have all this tested for in all their breeding stock and this is why dogs are so expensive a good dog is expensive because of all this testing this testing alone is hundreds upon hundreds of dollars so if you're going you're like oh i don't want to spend 2500 on a dog well i can guarantee you that they're probably spending in the 600 range 600 range on just testing a loan so because if you get x-rays done and you get an echo done that's at least four to five hundred dollars at least so yeah so there is that other tests that are available and i'm going to also link a couple of dna testing companies so there's paw print and there's ddc which are like the two main ones uc davis also has a veterinary uh canine dna testing site but most people most lab breeders that i know either use ddc so uh and dd as in dog dog cat or paw print so um other tests that you really should be looking for when um looking for a puppy or an adult dog is degenerative myelopathy which is dm and hereditary nasal perikeratosis aka hnpk and copper toxicosis so copper one's a little funky um there's different carriers i don't know i have not researched all of the correct information on that so it's a little bit involved and i can't tell you exactly how it all works because i don't quite understand it and i know it's a little bit complicated there's a great facebook group on facebook obviously and um there's a copper toxicosis site or group on there and there's a lot of great detail do some research um but it's basically being a dog being able to um handle the copper and its diet essentially so anyway so those are some um tests that you should be looking or asking your breeder in looking at pedigrees if when you're researching for a good breeder and that's about it so don't forget to subscribe leave me some comments if you have any questions um let me know what you guys want to find out more i'm gonna have my next video should i think it'll be my next video maybe one after is going to be a video on um five questions to ask a breeder to see if they are a responsible breeder and i'm going to be referencing this video in that so i wanted to get this out first and so don't forget to like subscribe and share these videos and again i'm gonna have a link to the websites that i referenced down below and yeah so thanks for watching guys have a great day", "9aZwEOit6vU": "so how do I pick a puppy that's right for me welcome to cornerstone gun blog Academy where you can learn to train your retriever with our online videos and this is a really great question and that's how do I pick a puppy now the first tip that's really going to be the most important for you is just pick the litter that's where you want to start you want to make sure that you get the right litter and what I mean by that is you want to make sure you get the right parents that are gonna exhibit tendencies that you like and that's again another reason why we've mentioned from one of our previous posts that a good breeder is gonna be one of your most valuable resources because they're really going to help make sure that you get off on the right track and they're gonna understand the dogs and they're gonna understand what you're looking for and help set you up and pair you with the right pairing of parents so but what I do want you to understand is that the pig the tendencies that the parents exhibit are really what you should be searching for in a puppy because most likely your puppy is gonna be similar to the parents obviously the color is gonna be very similar even the personality the way they run all of those different things now as your dog's not gonna be an exact clone of the parents but that is a good place to start when you choose the right parent you're gonna know that you're going to be getting some quality puppets because you already have an idea of what you're getting now once you have picked the litter it's really going to boil down to a few other things now this next one I'm going to mention it actually ties to picking the litter and that's color and there's really no right or wrong color that's better than the other they're all great so it's really just a personal preference whichever color you like but that is pretty important that you choose the right parents because not all parents are gonna throw the exact color you're looking for but your breeder will know that and they can help match you match you up with the right pairing so that you get the right color and the right tenant sees that you're looking for the next choice is sex do you want male or female and really there's no right or wrong answer here either because both are gonna perform extremely well it's really just a personal preference and what you're looking for now will say this if you do have a female and they're intact just keep in mind that they do have heat cycles so that could kind of interfere with your hunting a little bit if it falls during hunting season but other than that there's really not much different and sometimes the Mel's are slightly bigger but at the end of the day it's really not going to make that much of a difference it's just a personal preference do you want to mouth or do you want a female personality is next and this is again where your breeders going to come in and be able to help you because number one you are going to get an idea when it comes to their parents but every puppy has a different personality so what they're gonna be able to do is they're they're kind of watching every puppy and they've got a good feel for what the puppies are gonna be their tendencies and kind of what personality they might have and depending on which pick of the litter you are maybe your first pick just kind of depending on when you got your deposit in your make it to actually be the first pick so personality will come into play there but at the end of the day if you've picked the litter first it really isn't going to matter and it's gonna boil down to the last and most important thing you can guess what that is that is you you are the most important factor in this because once you have picked the litter and it's up to you to take this puppy this bundle of just tons of potential and to mold it into all that it is going to be because the puppy will never reach its potential by itself it is up to you to help establish and help get it to where it needs to be and help it reach its potential whether you send it to a trainer or whether you do the training yourself you are still responsible for making sure that pup reaches its potential so if you keep all those things in mind and you really think through it and you talk to your breeder make sure that they help you pick the right puppy then you're gonna most likely end up with a puppy just like you're looking for you [Music]", "HTTSLXwIjiQ": "what oh [ __ ] man mostly Maui wowie yeah but it's got some Labrador in it what's Labrador

Park in the life of a man", "rltPuKGjacI": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] hey guys I'm Barton Ramsey from cornerstone gundog Academy and this is your retriever training tip of the episode in this episode we're going to talk about steadiness it's a very important factor that you need to instill in your dog and all of your training dogs need to wait at your side until being sent for a retrieve there's a lot of danger involved with the dog breaking if guys are shooting low birds guys don't understand how to watch for a dog dogs can be injured and/or killed and so we talked about steadiness and the whole idea here is teaching your dog the concept of not everything that falls and hits the ground is his or hers to pick up so we have rudder here as a young dog and we're just gonna throw a couple dummies out and these are called denial retrieves we're going to deny him to retrieve now if you have a very young dog you're gonna want to do this on lead he's been through these a few times before so we're awfully now we're working on that and we're just got tossed a dummy out we're gonna say sit sit we're not gonna send him sit we're gonna walk out and pick it up ourselves sit good boy good boy and this is an introduction to denial retrieves obviously you want to have your dog obedience wise at a remote sit before you get to this point you can use a place board if that helps but we're going to continue to do this and we'll increase the difficulty by walking away from him and actually throwing them toward the dog you don't want to do this all in one training session but you want to build up to where you can throw it sit sit sit towards the dog and pick it up yourself the whole concept here is not everything that flies and hits the ground is yours to pick up and we're gonna build from this and in the next training segment we're going to show you how to do this with multiple dogs and then we're going to show you how to do this with gunfire lots of dogs lots of interactions so we build up to where you have a dog who's steady on a hunt even when another dog is going to pick up the birds they'll sit still on the blind or on the tree stand or at your side until you send them your boy sit", "x4WvJVZE4rs": "okay here they are the little four week olders this is our lady in clyde litter they are like oh my gosh what is going on out here where are we oh my goodness you guys

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys I'm Joshua Parvin with Cornerstone gundog Academy this is your retriever training tip of the episode as waterfowl hunters we spend a lot of our time hunting in and around the water and we expect the same of our gun dogs in fact we want them to love the water so much that they almost can't get enough of it what I want to talk with you about today is how you can take your young puppy and begin to develop its love of water one of the things we like to do within the first few weeks of having our puppies home has introduced them to water using the kiddie pool this allows them to have a fun and exciting experience with the water now for us it's easy because we live in a warmer climate but if you live in a colder climate or if it's cold outside I recommend introducing your puppy of the water maybe in a basement or a garage or anywhere where it's going to be warm enough for the puppy to have a positive experience we like to take our pool put it out in the front yard and fill it halfway up with water this allows the puppy to get in the water splash and really have a good experience with it now some puppies may be really excited about jumping in the water while others may be reluctant if your puppy is reluctant and don't worry it will learn to love the water now if you do have a reluctant puppy take your time and do whatever it takes to encourage the puppy to jump in the water splash around get in the pool yourself and encourage the puppy to come on in you can use lots of vocal praise lots of hand praise and do anything that you can to encourage the puppy to get in the water now when you do have your puppy and it enjoys the water I recommend doing this a lot over the next few weeks of your puppies life this will only make it easier for you when you formally introduce your gundog to the water later", "TXnD6NZvT3s": "the foothills of the Black Mountains in southern Wales are a magical place it was after driving over them that we met up with one of Britain's foremost experts in gun dog training tim merrill tim is a field trials judge in the UK and in the republic of ireland and told me he's had dogs since he was a little boy of five I casually asked him how long he'd been training gun dogs and Tim replied since I was five I suddenly realized I was in the presence of a real expert we spend an afternoon with him as he showed us some standard training techniques with his two Labradors glen and dan first Tim walked to a higher Ridge on the moorland here he showed as the technique known as a marked retrieve the dogs walked a hill and then sit attentively Tim then uses a dummy launcher which accustoms the dogs to the bang of gunfire the dogs must watch carefully marking the dummies as they fall to the ground Tim then does what is called casting out where his three-year-old Glen is pointed on the right line to follow this time he sends Dan his two-year-old when the dog is initially not in the right area Tim uses a specific whistle command to call the dog's attention so that he can indicate a direction to take we were in thick Heather on the moorland typical of British hunting terrain where the dumbest can easily become lost and difficult to spot the next technique is called a blind retrieve for this Tim goes to another part of the heath and instructs the dogs to wait ten then walked over a hill so that he is well out of sight and throws dummies into a memorable position when he collects the dogs one at a time they have no visual marking of where the dummies are and have to rely solely on Tim's commands first he carefully casts the dog in the right direction you Tim does the same exercise with the second dog over many days of training the dogs know their masters voice and the meaning of his commands when Tim gives what he calls the steady whistle this tells the dog he's near the quarry and must root around in that area I noticed that Tim's Labrador tales were wagging all day they just love these exercises it simply shows they're intelligent obliging nature and the harmony that can exist between man and dog the third technique is called the long memory retrieve initially Tim gets the dogs to mark a particular spot where he throws the dummies - then he walks the dogs right back over the moorland to his parked vehicle Tim then costs one of the dogs out to retrieve the dummy this was something quite special to watch not just the dog sheer energy and enthusiasm but the uncanny memory of exactly where the dummies were hidden it has to remember the distance traveled the spot where the dummy fell and then bring it all the way back without any damage and with what Tim called a nice delivery the day we spent with Tim and his two dogs Glenn and Dan was very special it was all inspiring to watch two beautiful intelligent dogs bring everything they could to the job of simply pleasing their owner like the surrounding terrain itself it seemed quite magical", "MQ3GIeT_S-E": "[Music] hi this is jamel with rochester labs in beautiful statesville north carolina i am so excited to introduce the best english lab liver i think we have ever produced this is harper and these are her eight beautiful puppies from jack they were born february 6 so they're less than a couple weeks old their eyes haven't even opened there are four boys and four girls they were born february 6th they are all doing exceptionally well this is the first time we've listed them for sale we always like to wait until the puppies are a couple weeks old just to make sure they pull it through the hardest time of their life and they are all super healthy they're super fat this is harper's first litter and her puppies are absolutely exceptional she is a great mother very attentive one thing we have learned breeding dogs over the last 15 years maybe half of them are good mothers the other half are deadbeats and but she's a good mom she's very loving very gentle very caring she's even putting her arm over her puppies because she wants to protect them she's an exceptional mother now this puppy these puppies are super beautiful the parents are harper and jack what makes this litter maybe the best litter we've ever produced number one by far is their health clearances we have never had a litter of english labs that have higher health clearances in fact i don't think you can both parents scored excellent with their ofa health clearances they have their hip their elbows their eyes their heart their eic and their cm clearances that is six health clearances more than it's recommended and only four percent of labs score excellent with their hips and so this is the healthiest you can possibly get and both parents scored exactly the same and they come from generations of health clearances it's just an absolutely stunning litter now these puppies are able to go home after graduating either number one puppy academy which is training until 12 weeks of age which is may 1st now the great thing about these puppies they're going home at the most popular time to take home a puppy which is springtime the weather is a lot warmer people are getting out of school they have a lot more time to be able to take their puppy home there's two things that make us different from any other english lab reader in the world the first thing is the quality of our puppies all of our adults are english labs not american labs that means they're shorter they're stockier they're healthier they're calmer and that's the reason why we chose to get english labs versus american labs the second thing that makes us different is every one of our puppies receive at least 250 up to a thousand hours of training depending on which training level you let them in the first training level is puppy academy that's 250 hours of training which is training until 12 weeks of age we do not let our properties go home before 12 weeks of age every one of our puppies are trained and receive hundreds of hours of training that's may 1st the second training level is our most popular training program called canine college it's training until 16 weeks of age which is may 29th now it's the most popular training program because they're still very young they have a long life ahead of them they have all of their shots so they're fully inoculated to give them at 12 weeks yourself to quarantine them secondly they're potty training they'll be able to hold the restroom twice as long at 16 weeks than at 12 weeks and the biggest reason people choose canine college over any other program especially puppy academy is their obedience commands they grow the most between the ages of 12 or 10 and 16 weeks of age so many times puppies are three times better obedience trained at 16 weeks than at 12 weeks the third training level is master's program which is training until 20 weeks of age which is june 26th and the fourth train level is doggy doctor just training until six months of age which is august 6. now if you want to really learn about each of the training programs i highly encourage you to go to our puppy training institute page there we have videos of puppies that have gone through these training programs and you can actually see the go home videos of puppies that have graduated so you can learn in detail of what puppy academy is canine college's master's program is what i'm going to do right now is to summarize our puppy training institute obviously we're not showing these puppies we're going to show off some of our regular puppies and then i'll come back and let you know what you need to do if you want to reserve one of these puppies our puppy training institute has four core areas there's a couple areas that are very visible that we're going to show you on camera with the puppy that's for sale some of the areas are a little bit more difficult but the one area that's very visible the show is outside training and the big part of that is lease training puppies love the pool love the tug love the cut in front of you and so we train them to walk on our left side we train them that when we stop walking they do what's called an auto sit that's where they automatically sit without being told without having any hand signals they automatically sit that it builds respect and focus on you a couple other areas in outside training it's a little bit harder to show is car training and then also swim training when the weather is warmer the second area that's very visible is obedience training all of our trainers are certified dog trainers that's been training dogs for years they know what they're doing they're all certified they all can do canine good citizen they're all very good trainers and we work on the obedience commands of sit down stay come place kennel and they are trained extensively in all these areas now we have three different communication tools we use with the puppies we use hand signals we use words and then we use the training lead that we will provide you and so as they get older they get better and better they can hold their stay longer they can hold their place longer they can hold their kennel longer um they can do it with both hand signals and words only and so they get better and better the place is when they jump up on the coronda cot you will definitely want to buy a krondikot because that allows the transition for our training to go to you it's a wonderful command when we say kennel they go into their kennel on their own volition we typically keep the door open especially as they get older and we train them they cannot leave the kennel or really any other door until they're until they are released the two other areas it's a little bit more difficult that we're going to show you just um generic dogs going through this the one area is house training we actually spend more time in house training than all the other areas combined that's about two-thirds of the training and this is where we work on the most important area of potty training of course we're training them not to use the restroom inside and the signal eventually to go outside a puppy at 12 weeks of age can typically hold the restroom about one hour during the day whereas a puppy at six months can do four hours the same thing is with crate training we train them to sleep at night in their crate eat in the crate and a 12 week old can typically sleep around four to five hours without having to be let out and a six month old it's you know six to ten hours so obviously the longer they're in training the longer they can be crate trained we also know while they're in house training we train them not to jump up on us not to chew things in the house not to bite our hands it's very extensive and then the last area is socialization training many people worry about getting a trained our older puppies that they won't bond well because of our socialization program our puppies bond very quickly in fact we've never had a client complain about that and so in our socialization we're training them not to be afraid of thunderstorms we're training them not to be afraid of the hair dryer of the blow dryer of a vacuum cleaner we have a tv in our in our puppy training area in our house training area where we're socializing them they go on field trips when they get older we work extensively on them being handled we have 20 plus people that work for us so these puppies are handled by multiple people and they're socialized extensively that is our puppy training institute now if you're interested in one of these puppies read through this entire page if you scroll always to the bottom you'll see pictures and videos that we just took of these puppies above the most recent video or pictures are the prices for each training level and some people have a hard time finding the prices so in this video we're going to show you where the prices are found on a typical page right now what we're doing is we're reserving picks of the litter and so if you reserve the first pick of the boys you would get the first pick of the boys we wait till the puppies are about five weeks of age that gives them enough time to grow physically emotionally mentally and then we will shoot a group video of all the boys or if you get a girl all the girls we will give you a personality description we call it the resurrection score where you go into detail of the personality differences of every puppy and then we will give professional pictures of every puppy and then you make your decision if you live local or if you don't you can come here and make your selection in person so we go to the first per pick of the boys and then we first pick of the girls we give them the four girls four boys they choose their puppy and then we go to the second pick the third pick the fourth pick gets whichever puppy is not reserved and we do that and so you can reserve the puppy that works best for you obviously the earlier you

puppy Brooks mill Gertrude just over 12 months of age this final clip covering basic training gives guidance to reaching the objective of the double mark retrieve I break this down in various stages as you will see in the diagrams the first diagram sets out what we want to achieve it's important before you start training for this objective you must be confident your doctor complete all the training tasks in our basic video clips I here work memory mark go back to mine and short Direction retrieved do not start double marks until you have established these previous training tasks it's important when you do start stage 1 your dog is not running in to a fallen dummy in the video clip you will see I start the exercise leaving the dog sitting in the center ask the doctor stay wall forward approximately 15 meters and place or throw the dummy effort the 10 meters make sure you are between the doc and the dummy if the dog moves quickly pick up the donnager event a success if the doc steady returned to the dog walking past the dog another 15 meters in the opposite direction to weigh you through the first mark and place or throw the dummy in all the ten meters then return to the dog turn around and face the first mark line up and send the dog if your dog returns with the dummy to happen praise the dog put the dummy in your training vest and set up for the second retrieve and sent this completes stage one repeat until you're confident of the progress making sure your dogs not pulling forward before sending and and you have a nice having completed this part of the stage one process I've uploaded a diagram on the screen there and just to show you this stage one I've also uploaded a video clip where I'm now throwing the dummies from the heel position without running in on the dummies and being steady before being sent I still have some work to do on the delivery and I'm going to time this up before I move on to stage two having completed stage one and polished the delivery a little better although there's still room for some improvement I'm now very confident the dog is not running here I can now start stage two i reduced the angle between the two mark retrieves from 180 degrees to 90 degrees I suggest if possible to use suitable ground and facilities to minimize complications if the doc is modeled or confused you need to go back and carry on practicing stage one or even further back with your heel work and memory marks you can see in the video clip I use a fence line and the gate for this purpose having completed stage two we are now going to move on to stage three which is more or less identical to stage two orbit on using different directions on 360 degrees still keeping the angle at 90 degrees of actually working in more open ground so the dog has a choice to swap if it wanted to but it gives you a good opportunity to practice this to make sure the dog can change angles of 90 degrees we're now moving on to stage 4 diagram we're throwing out four marks all at 90 degrees to each other on a 360 degree circle and now want the dog to pick two of the retrieves and the handler walking out and picking remaining two retrieves after you've completed the two marks when you're actually satisfied that the dog is changing direction and steady and picking the retrieve that you want to pick on a 360 degree circle at 90 degrees we can then move on to stage 5 we're now moving on to stage 5 and stage 5 we throw three market Reeves in the example of load I've uploaded a diagram to show what we're actually doing I'm trying to do and the video clip will show you that the throw three dough is out to 45 degrees from here one behind the dock and then send the dog the two retrieves out in front laid the dog sitting there and go and pick it up the third retrieve I could have actually uploaded a clip which would have been a little bit more perfect you'll probably see on one of the retrieves Suzy decides to play with a dummy these are the sort of things that happen with training I made the mistake of throwing a dummy with a toggle on it so she decided to have a bit of a play the other thing which I haven't mentioned out through the series all the various stages of these video clips is the dogs million season so almost up and and down a bit but I thought it would give a bit of a touch of reality to the situation well here we are on the last video clip demonstrating the final training objective which is a double mark you'll see two dummies that are thrown out from the heel position 45 degrees 90 degrees between the two hopefully the dog steady and not running in when it's lined up to be sent and it doesn't swap from one dummy to the next to me and hopefully we've got reasonable delivery I think you'll see through the video clips the delivery is starting to improve you've seen one or two mishaps during the sort of training process that's par for the course that's what happens the videos got quite a long one showing all the various stages as to how we achieve this objective but I hope you find it useful and enjoyable and good luck with your training thank you for watching you you", "Hkpkj2SGdIk": "I could talk forever about dogs really we've got six dogs working retrievers working Labradors we do competitions I suppose I really fell into it by accident I didn't have dogs as a youngster both my parents worked full-time and so it wasn't practical for us to have dogs it was only later on when I met my husband we met in Zimbabwe he introduced me to dogs and I just really enjoyed them when we came back to the UK we were able to get our own first Labrador here and we were introduced to the gun dog scene and what they could do I think I think everyone thinks their dogs are special Labradors are the ultimate retrieving dog but they're also so versatile because they make great pets they're their nature and their temperament is is kind and their biddable they take to their retrieving work really well and they're just so easy to train really they almost train themselves all our dogs are working Labradors they're bred to work in the field was gun dogs we enjoy working in season which is the winter but we're also involved in working test in the summer where they fetch canvas dummies and simulated reading exercises that's their raison d'\u00eatre as bears being a working gun dog for them it's not really work at play and we enjoy it as well so it's a it's a partnership we both love working together I used the Socorro dog coats in a lot of different applications but they really come into their own during the winter when I'm working the dogs on shoots I take the dogs out and work them during a drive and when they're finished where I wrote the dogs up and put them back in the truck we then move on to another Drive where the dogs will be working and in that time and the dogs have had a chance to warm up and dry off in the capes also at lunchtime when the dogs are sitting in the car for maybe up to an hour they've got the coats on and it just keeps the muscles warm and any moisture from their coats again the seeker Road dog mats a very versatile I have a couple of them in the back of my truck so when the dogs go into the truck it just wicks the moisture off them I also use dog mats at home in front of the fire if the dogs come in from outside and it's been raining they're a bit wet they can just lie down on the mat and it just takes the moisture out of their coat so you don't end up with about carpets and wet furniture I'd recommend Socorro products to people who who lead an active lifestyle with their dogs and work their dogs secret of coat is an ideal project to just wick away the moisture from the dog and leave you with a dry cleaned up afterwards [Music] you [Music]", "qIzc-piF7TE": "hi cat was standing stone kennels and this is rogue and we just got done camping over the fourth of July and it was a good experience for rogue but also kind of exhausting for us because she really likes to pull on lead so that gave us a good indication that she is ready to start healing using our easy lead because she likes to well she's paying attention to bugs and stuff right now but she really likes to pull and then work already around your legs and get all tangled up and get herself all tangled up um so we are about ready to be done with that so we're gonna use our ez lead to show you how we're going to help work her through that something else that I want to keep at the forefront of your guys's attention is we've done some field work with rogue already I don't like to put a lot of emphasis on healing with a young puppy that doesn't have a lot of confidence in the field searching you put too much emphasis on them having to stick right by your side for healing and then you start trying to go to the field and they don't feel as comfortable and confident going out and searching the field and finding birds but as you've seen in some of rogue's previous videos she's definitely improving with her search getting out hunting finding birds and not being real sticky and clingy with us so we are going to be able to start with healing men so first we're going to get the lead set up I go under her head and then back up through this little ring that we've got here oh you're tired already and then once we've got a slip lead that's clipped to her flat collar we can get a little slack and put that up over her muzzle so the biggest part of using this lead is getting them comfortable having it up over their muzzle so as she gets comfortable with that I'm just going to give her a little bit of pressure when she fights until she relaxes we're not we're not 13 walking right away we're trying to let her get comfortable with this first a lot of dogs might try and pot off of their nose shake their head a little a bit and we just don't want her to get out of it so we just put a little pressure up behind her ears and then this lead we want to stay centered behind her ears like that good she's like this is different so I'm gonna be encouraging with her at first she's kind of like I'm not sure what to do with this so we're gonna help her take a few steps and if she starts fighting we'll just take a second to help her feel comfortable just taking a few baby steps good but most dogs settle in and feel comfortable with this in just a few minutes so when she's spinning around and fight and we're just gonna stop walking until she gives in and then start taking a few steps again when she stops or sits down like that we just need to help encourage her and get her moving again moving her feet come on a few light tugs good good changing some directions light tugs to keep her moving come on stop jump in on me girl come come now it's also important that when she is walking by my side not chewing on it but walking by my side that she's not feeling constant pressure come on and that my hand drops down by my side so that she gets a little release on that pressure behind her ears and above her muzzle come on come in so and light tugs to keep her moving instead of constant pressure she won't have something to fully dig in her feet and resist against good we're already making a lot of progress not fighting so much while she's at my side she's not feeling the lead tighten up now if she lunges out ahead that lead is gonna automatically tighten up on its own and be self-correcting but then when she gets back into position she's not feeling any pressure which is important so that she can learn when she's healing properly she's not gonna feel any of that pressure over her muzzle or behind her ears so she's learning to turn that pressure off she just needs to be in the right position she starts to fight again it tightens back up you can make a few minor adjustments make sure that that leads still in position it just takes really light pressure you don't wear your arm out heeling and teaching dogs to heel this way and keeping her focused and getting her attention in an encouraging manner helps so she pulled ahead like that and she felt those leash tighten up until she's back in position and then she doesn't feel any any type of pressure there okay good girl give her a little attention I'm gonna show you how to put this back on again because that's sometimes one of the most confusing and complicated parts of this whole process plus the more that she gets used to having the leash put on and off the more comfortable she's gonna get with that process when we're putting the lead on we want to make sure that when we get the slip lead in position we go under her muzzle or under her head and then we slide this pinch the handle and slide it up through that ring so then when we have our slip lead in place it slips off the outside because when we're healing we're healing on the left she's like I'm hot I'm tired so when it slips off the outside like that when she tightens up and then we released there's automatic release on that tension now if we were had it the other way and we're healing on the right it's not gonna want to release as nicely it's gonna bind up so once we get the slip lead in place I can give myself a little slack make a little twist and then up over her muzzle like that she's getting pretty comfortable with letting me put the lead in place which is important good so we're gonna take a few more loops around the yard with her healing she's already staying in position not fighting and struggling with the lead and we're only a few minutes into this session she gets distracted or is looking off in another direction I try and redirect her focus with a few tugs and just snapping my fingers as a redirection you can change directions by turning into them so you're using your body to help turn them but as you can see this is a huge improvement onto the simple clip style lead that we had started out with where she's jerking and pulling and tangling me up and tangling herself up and we've made a lot of progress just in this first session the really nice thing about this lead is that once row gets proficient healing with the lead up over her muzzle like this which it's gonna take a little while she's a puppy this is her first session we need to make sure that this is really solid before we decide to switch to the next step but this lead can go from over the muzzle which gives us the most control to the slip style just taking it off their muzzle and then eventually back to the clip style now when you're doing the slip style and your dog's healing really nicely if you get into a high distraction situation like a rabbit runs across the yard or you're meeting somebody on the walk with another dog and you know that your dog is gonna get a little more distracted all you have to do is take a second on your walk and slip that up over there muzzle and then you've got that action extra control then once you get out of that distracting situation back into a slip style and when your dog gets really good back to the clip style lead and then eventually this can transition to complete off lead collar condition to heal which we're quite a ways from that with miss rogue but she did great this morning she's getting hot so we're gonna call that a great first session with her healing remember to like us on facebook follow us on Instagram and subscribe to us on YouTube for more puppy training videos", "vrV6BLv7oy4": "- Over the course of shooting this vlog, it's come to my attention that someone is deliberately trying to take advantage of me. And we're gonna sort that out right now. (light music) (dog barking) Over the last couple of videos, I've noticed editing the footage after that I've a lot less hair on the top of my head than I once did. And I mean, I don't get a chance to look at my top of my head very often, and this whole time my barber. I've been going to the same\nplace for a long time now and they've been charging\nme the same price. Which doesn't really make sense to me. I mean, if you have someone do flooring you pay per square foot or if you have someone paint a fence, you pay per the length of the fence. But these guys have been\ntrying to take advantage of me and I very clearly have a lot\nless hair than I once did. We're gonna have a stern\ntalk to the barber in there, and I'll let you know how it goes. (upbeat music) Thank you. So as it turns out, it's a flat rate. She said even if I had half as much hair it would cost me the same amount. (upbeat music) Camera one. Camera two. Camera one. Camera two. Camera one. Camera two. We actually got a new camera and I think I'm going to be using it for the rest of the vlog today. It's a big difference from the iPhone. If I got a call before and I was vlogging, it would completely stop the recording. So that was a bit of a problem. I've also got another big announcement. I've got a puppy. A black Lab puppy. He's not actually mine, but Corey and Jen, good friends of ours, went away for the week. So we have Bruin and we're\ngonna do some training and do some fun stuff. But today, we're gonna see if Bruin likes to swim. Deegan didn't love to swim at first. Let's find out if Bruin does. Is it a natural Lab thing? Let's find out. (upbeat music) I also brought the long line just so that Bruin could have a little bit of that sense of freedom, but if I needed to intervene or help him out to be right then, I was able to do that. But let's go for a quick walk. We're gonna go back down to one of the spots we've been to before. Not near where I had that hike that went horribly wrong where we had to run past the bees. Well, no not those bees, but these bees. (bees buzzing) So we're not gonna go that way. But we are gonna go a\nlittle farther up the stream and see if there's enough water. If it's a fun spot for\nthe dogs to have a swim. (upbeat music) Leave it to a Lab puppy to immediately pick up the\nfirst stick that he sees and decide to bring it along on the hike. (upbeat music) Now, I don't know if the spot where we're gonna go\ntoday has that much water, has enough water for Bruin to get in up to his chest, but it'll be a good introduction for him being a young dog. Having Deegan there. I actually wore my water shoes. As you can hopefully see there. So if I need to jump in and help him out or get him out, I'm ready to do so. (upbeat music) It is safe to say that he officially loves the water, and whether Deegan being\nthere was helpful or not, I don't know, because he was really\ncommitted to going in once he realized that\nthe water was down there. And the other thing that I love to see, especially with a Labrador puppy, is that he loves to\ncarry stuff in his mouth. Which is really adorable at this age, but also could be a pretty\nfunctional skill in the future. So the puppies or the dogs and I are gonna head back to the house. Everybody needs to sort of dry off and have a bit of a rest and then I think I might\ndo a little bit of training with Bruin after. On a completely unrelated note, I watched the movie The\nKingsman last night. And if anybody hasn't seen\nThe Kingsman and thinks, oh, I really wanna see The Kingsman, right now is the time you should probably pause the video, go watch The Kingsman, then come back, 'cause this is a little\nbit of a spoiler alert. In the movie The Kingsman, a pivotal point, the main character is required to injure a dog. And this is like a real turning point. And it was at that moment\nthat I hated the movie. I couldn't watch anymore. I put in my headphones. I just couldn't bear with it. It was just awful. I mean, I couldn't believe what they were suggesting\nthe character do. And I dislike the movie. And I didn't really pay\nattention to the end. So if anybody is a huge Kingsman fan, let me know in the comments below and let me know what happens in the end. But it made me think of\nthe movie I Am Legend. I can't even watch that movie anymore, because of the dog. And I wondered, are there any other movies that I need to be aware of where the dog gets killed. I mean, I need to know now, because if I get half-way into a movie and something like that happens, I can't watch the rest. And time's a pretty valuable thing. Are there any movies that you guys would suggest I don't watch? Because I felt so awful. It just completely\nruined the movie for me. (upbeat music) You know, we've heard all sorts of reasons why you should crate train your dog, and this is a pretty good one right now. So we have Bruin in the kitchen. Right now he's in Bee Line's crate, but he's so comfortable\nand relaxed in there. Okay, buddy. It's just such a nice\nplace for him to hang out. This is a brand new environment. He's never been in our house before. So it's so nice to be able to just put him in his crate. A place where he can relax and chill out and certainly a place\nhe can sleep over night without getting into trouble. So if you're sort of on the fence, like should I crate train my dog? This is a reason enough. If you ever have to go\naway and need to take him to a friend's or family\nmember's or whatever, having a dog that's\ncomfortable in the crate is a great reason to crate train. Okay, so I've come down to the studio where you may have seen\nus film some videos such as this. - People are often concerned about using too much\nfood in their training. They think that if they use a lot of food, the dog will become too dependent on it, will only learn to listen when they have treats in their hand. In this video, we're gonna talk\nabout the method of luring. And if it's done properly, you can actually work towards not needing any food at all. I'm Kayl McCann. Welcome back to McCann dogs. - And what we wanna work on today, Bruin's never done, Bruin's done some of the Headstart program at McCann's with Corey and Jen. And today, he missed his first lesson. So what I want to do with him is work on one skill, for example. And I've done a little bit of work walking on a loose leash. But I want to work on the sit\nand start position with him, because he had a big day today with swimming and running\naround with Deegan and things. So I want to do sort of a simple exercise that we can work on. And what I want to do is try to get him to the point where he can move into that sit and start position or what we're gonna\ncall the get in position on a very subtle hand gesture. So you guys are gonna see us\nwork through that right now. And he's never had an\nopportunity to do that with me. Let's see what we can accomplish. Here, bro. Get in. Good boy. Sit. Good. Okay. Get in. Sit. Yes, good boy! Good. Good boy. Good. Okay. Here, bud. Get in. Sit. Yes, good boy! Good. Sit. Good boy. And this is great, because he's really holding\nposition quite well. Good boy. Okay. So now let's try one with zero food. So I'm gonna put my food\nback in the big pouch. Get in. Sit. Yes, good boy. He did great! Very good, buddy. That was no food in the hand. That was good. This dog's really great\nat following a lure. And I know Corey and Jen have probably worked on\nthat quite a lot with him. And he's also great at\nthis sit-in position and he's not getting out. (claps) Even when I do\nlittle distractions. Yes! Good boy. Nice job, buddy. Very good. Nice job. Okay. So we're gonna reduce that\nsignal just a little bit and see what happens. Get in. Pretty close. Try it again. Maybe a little bit more of a signal. Get in. Sit. Yay, good boy, buddy. Way to go. Nice job. He did so well. Good boy. Yes, good boy. Well, that was fun and Bruin was able to work\noff of food pretty quickly. I was even able to work\nthe lure down a little bit, and I was really impressed\nthat he worked so well without a really strong lure. I mean, this was, you saw it happen. That was literally like three or four\nminutes worth of luring. So, I'm really impressed with him, and I'm looking forward\nto the next couple of days and I hope you guys are, too. On that note, I'm gonna shut things down\nfor the vlog for tonight and work on another couple exercises, maybe give Bruin the rest of his dinner. And I want to remind you guys to do something awesome\nwith your dog today. Thanks for watching.", "W1efA-bUeaY": "hello everyone this is buck you've seen him in the previous film I know a lot retriever poops on the videos you don't see much of that because it's all straight line training dr. hill but in reality all these dogs work on shoots and they're all required to hunt up so we're just gonna call him on this Bank as you were the spaniel and see how it gets on I'm going to drop retrieves as we go boy that's a little rabbit-skin dying and basically that's what we have to work on this helps with long-range handing as well so if you're handing the dog at a distance and you'll go and left them right when they're caught in they're looking at me all the time and they're looking at my hands go right you'll go right if I push my hand left to go left that's why spaniels normally take hand directions better than what Labrador do because it's all about if you do this with your Labradors a distance there'll be much more receptive on the hands okay so we're back out training with buff again you've seen the previous video he's coming on he's starting to get stuff now so now we're just stepping up and working on you know really advanced stages training what we're doing today we're send him back on the memory retrieval but she knows he's there but halfway to get in there I'm going to stop him on the whistle I'm then gonna fire the dummy launcher let off a shot which again will wind him up a little bit this is Alby my little boy and I'm gonna send the other dog for the retrieve off the launcher whilst but hopefully sits there and wakes if he doesn't he's a good boy he'll be sent back for the original retrieve that he was sent for this kind of thing you must do in your training if you're gonna go picking up on the driven shoot because we've all seen it on shoot people send their dog for a bird the drive still going on other birds are four-wheeling it will leave that one and run to that one next things lift that run to another one and you've lost all control and none of us want that now is it embarrassing very popular with the guns running random so this kind of thing go back come on stop if you want you talk to sit down and there standing which isn't a problem if you're handing them a little tip unpredictability produces stability so if you keep walking to the side the dog won't know what you're doing and that wondering he will sit down so now I'm going to let off the shot now this has just been plowed so hopefully he'll pick it you seen it down slightly wound up that's not terrible how do you move quite bit I wouldn't be sending him for the retrieve I've done picked that myself it's not too bad so I'm going to go crazy [Music] never be lazy with you dog training if he's done well when he's out there you must go out and praise it let the dog know you can get to him anywhere he is and when he's out there he's a good boy as well so I'm gonna push him back on the news my right arm because that retrievers off to the left and I'm going to give her come on leave that and send him back and hopefully he will remember the dead bird which is down just past that oak tree leave that but go back there you go straight on it good boy again with buck he's a very big dog he's very bouncing so I'm still working on him coming in and delivering that nicely but he's doing really well so I'm very pleased with that", "RPCmjSYHgOM": "this is little cult I think he's about four and a half months old I'm not quite sure when I see a morning before I've now he saw a boy or a dog River out of a friends working ditch and the cracking little dog we haven't done much with him to the eyes fear just plenty of play mucking about you know and you're just starting now to do a bit of retrieving and stuff sitting just knowing his name and coming back longer grass here and we're gonna try getting a retrieve out there's no point just chucking dummies in brambles straight away they've got gradually build up so you start with a bit of rough grass literally and then you work up the covers he's only a baby still so I'll sit him up oh good boy now cuz not a lots been done with Colt he will more than likely try and run in when the retrieve goes out so what I do I stand in front of them and I'll fry the retrieving does go to move I can put them back on the spot back down to their level you came to quite intimidating to a puppy if you stand over them so just get down low and then encourages a nice delivery and that's Colt the cops just down the retrieve out the grass I'm gonna sling this out and now into the field and give him a nice marquetry he's never actually picked a dummy this size and what they tend to do is drag them back by the end but over time they don't pick them first time he's ever had the dummy straight up and straight in the middle come on good boy absolute cracking this little dog very pleased you so we're out training today we've got all the dogs with us the pups are in the car and we've got a nice duo from the trees but he's just shy of two years old we're just building his confidence up with different types of retrieve so you know pushing the dog open every opportunity to go right off the nose that way every opportunity to go in the right direction get out on the mark retrieve they might get on if I've seen it on a blind where you ask them to go so he's a fully trained dog we've got a blind retrieve just by that oak tree there undergrowth so I'm gonna send him out onto that which is pretty standard stuff really heard of his age but I'm gonna give a distraction tend to leave that bird and then push him on to the blind this is just a step up from what Jade was doing with Belle earlier where she saw both retrieves so this one he's gonna have to leave the one he's seen and go for the one he hasn't when you tell your doctor leave it a good tip just one step it's all you got to do just take the dog's mind up for what's going out knowing it up if you try it in or whatever you still want to get your dog going in the right way so put your foot in front off the nose and out from there start off right you stand a lot better chance of picking the bird if you're over here and you're going like that it all gets a bit messy yeah go back go back good news be ready for the language became onset in that area or anyway I just stopped him good dog dude I slept biopics go back no handling on this birds because he saw it down and you should just go straight out good boy and if you know he always sat there patiently don't and this like ever moved an injury so sit him up a little bit of praise", "HP1_uoyCDgU": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey guys I'm Barton Ramsey from cornerstone gundog Academy and this is your retriever training tip of the episode we're continuing our conversation about steadiness tonight and we have our dogs in a group setting we have a couple young dogs with us who have not been in a group setting before and we're really working on keeping them steady while other dogs retrieve it's called honoring have you ever shown up for a waterfowl hunt and someone else brought their dog this will be very important concept for your dog to have mastered your dog needs to know how to sit still in the blind while other dogs go and get a bird and so what we're going to do is we're going to shoot a mark off a remote launcher we're gonna send a more experienced dog and we're gonna watch the guys who have less experienced younger dogs handle their dog and work towards steadiness good dog mark so you see Brad's dog here Jason's gonna go ahead and send his dog and Brad is gonna tell his dog to heal he did a circle with his dog just continuing to focus on obedience his dog wanted to go immediately when he shot the mark instead of letting his dog go he's gonna turn around tell his dog to heal tell him to sit and continue to remind them Aaron's doing the same thing behind me just reminding their dog you don't get to get everything that hits the ground other dogs might get to get it other dogs might run out other dogs might even break in hunt your dog has to sit still and steady this is an important thing for your dog to have mastered if they're gonna be a waterfowl dog steady this is important for your dog safety because you don't know who's with you you don't know who's gonna be shooting at low birds that might fly out or try to fly away while your dog's running through the field you want to make sure that your dog sits tight until you send them so the dogs are sitting now

so I don't care really about the position of her feet yes I don't care about anything I just want the feet to hold still so as soon as they're still flick it and say yes and give her her food yes once she gets past steady feet and you can take the food Halina move it from this end to this hand behind your back and just hold the finger out there yes okay the next step will be hold the finger out there and move so you may not even get that far and she'll wonder what you're doing it shall move her feet yes but your goal is to graduate up with all your fingers so she's looking at it cuz she's not look there she is yes and your goal will be to move around to the front of her now notice kellene is just standing there she's not in good position but she's standing still that takes a lot of muscle control yes to stand that long in one position that's what you're going for I don't care about what she looks like right now yes okay that's not important what you going for steadiness and her not moving when you move and watching that finger so don't click it until she watches that finger okay", "eNWZZiJP0ss": "my theory on this guy's if you truly want a pointy lab and you truly want a pointer get away from the idea of training it like a lab if you want a point in lab trained it like a pointer my biggest recommendation to you is don't teach this dog to sit teach this dog to stand lay the yard work when you're doing your yard work with a dog you're doing your quartering you're doing your low word teach them like a pointer the biggest problem we have with a pointing lab is we're disappointed lab make this contact with a bird typically a pointing lab is their point from a very short distance so how do we get our pointing lab to point from 20 yards away where our say German Shorthaired Pointers pointing we bring our pointing lab in and we start doing the yard work pressure and release at greater distances you", "F6PxGBtQyEY": "[Music] it's Europe's best where on the beautiful corredor estate near inverness watching some punishing retrieves no comma we can advance the train and practice before they get here I mean not off the head staying with water sports our gumbo girl Gilly has some tips on how to turn your dog into the canine equivalent of Michael Phelps I'm out foxing with the south somerset ferreters we have we used stuff we have hunting youtube welcome to field-sports Britain [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] when you need to test the best you need a first-class location and for this year's Skinner's World Cup retriever event we are being spoiled rotten we're in a beautiful corner of the chordal estate here Inverness mentioned in Shakespeare's Macbeth an internationally celebrated for its shooting and fishing and for the next two days it's Moors rivers forests streams and woodlands with some fences and stone walls thrown in for good measure they will test 15 teams from across Europe to the limit you know it's a massive competition I mean some of these poor people are you know there must be mad to come this distance I mean they come colossal distances drive here with a dogs you know they'll come oh we can advance the Train and practice before they get here I mean not off the head but in a good way in a really good way and so good but it's good for the sport you know the more people that we can encourage any gun dogs there you know and it keeps gun dogs is a bead strong and it pushes a stand up higher and higher and that's what the best thing about it for the opening ceremony we are joined by Lord coddle will Denham all presents him with a bottle of English whisky from a distillery coaster the skinners mill in Suffolk could this jeopardize any further visits possibly but we can worry about that later England already ahead of Scotland and not a dummy has been launched there are five layouts per day each retrieve is scored out of 20 on stage one judged by Billy Steele jr. there are two retrieves the first is straight across the river and up steep Bank the second 200 metres to the left but again the river needs to be crossed when rowdy Forbes said the course the water was a lot higher so the retrieves are not as energy sapping as they could have been but the dogs still need to be super fit we try to give them every possible test all types of terrain all types of cover fences walls water daily holes at the yarn go up hills and angle all what kind of stuff just to find the best trained dog but also the first dog tell me about your fitness that stays together will done McKenzie told me in a Cell EDC they always like to be with dog turned sideways you could carry shreds of sunshine and they said that your dog's fit you can't see the ribs on a sunny day he's too far being relief and dog no not now from a pheasant drive to Partridge to gross the terrain changes and with it the challenge here the dog has to do a blind retrieve over a fence and 300 meters away high on a bank this is the best competition concerning the walking test and is this is the World Cup so and every country send the best dog before backlogged and every year is very challenging challenging rounds tester and it's always the pressure to come here here in the tests are super the grounds are difficult and the tests are very challenging yes long distances difficult grounds very technical or so so you need to have good dogs you need to underwear and unexpect to to retrieve and holder them is not easy all the time but [Music] from the dogs heading high they now have to look low the drop into the valley is perfect for the spectators and shows how adaptable these dogs need to be at the end of the first day the Danish team has a strong but not insurmountable lead the standards are getting higher and higher I think it's probably for teams that could be in green fighting to be honest tomorrow terms of stock dogs and Worf top dog that that still could be could be anyone to say there's been a real mix of scores has been I've seen 40 and I've seen from zero so a real mix one directory so nobody's bought the estate them to manager sets an absolutely fantastic pet if you couldn't ask for any more there's been guessing good so far [Music] our whole history from the early seventies in working dog and shooting and shooting and supporting that industry and this is just further support and to the sport the sport of working test grows and grows each year last year the championship was won by the Dutch team but there are plenty hoping to deny them a second title on the bounce there's plenty of passion and self belief otherwise what's the point it's going to come from the heart you've got to want it you know it's like any sport and life if I pack up a a golf club I want to be the best of that Golf Club you know and you've got to have that willingness you've got to want to be the best day - and we cross the estates - broadleaf woodland in the shadow of Cawdor castle again rowdy emulates real case scenarios the English team is pushing hard and catching the Danes we catch up with the England captain Dave Latham and ask whether the dogs react to the big occasion that showered out dollar point two or three years you know for what you'll get you on your own you're training and they come here they feel the pressure and excitement and they love it that much more difficult to control and especially at this dis was like me I don't know yesterday always 300 metres you know it was out an exaggeration on it you know to keep your dogs on the whistle I think we're very fortunate with the weather if it would have been windy and raining quite difficult most relatively quiet and still yesterday won it so it was in our favor you know that that distance into the wind would have been from what would have been difficult over the two days even the uninitiated can see how different dogs react to obvious obstacles such as water or a jump those with a keener eye and ear can spot how the different nations use different techniques to get their dog to the dummy yeah just watch there careful there now like it well I think some people stepped in very quick and once the dopes are in a tight line so we know people are very natural and they let the dogs go down the tree but the trusted dog can come back and they end up in the air input you know where we'll be stuffing our dogs and keeping them on a true line I think we should do but yeah it's different different styles and variations but you know throughout this throughout Europe yeah so the competition's our whole work there's something negative it oh yeah it's fantastic yeah especially calling it here to card you know I mean where you can really stretch it a doctor a limb account yet you know the war to the fences of the hills and you know and then now in woodland today to a different contrast again yeah fantastic I think it's hell of a journey of people a bit worried at first but I think they're all glad the cook and I think people love to come back given the opportunity [Music] after two days of hard competition the results are in basking in beautiful Scottish sunshine the Dowager Countess corridor presents the trophies first it's the top dog award which goes to John Hendrickson from Denmark then for the teams in third it's the Dutch second comes the England team making up huge ground to get within eight points of the winners Denmark everything has got a plan rowdy can finally relax his course has given these competitors plenty to think about and to work on the Sun cleaners great akedan he's a keeper here advice keeper all his guys are bought and set my group my life's important that all the loaders packers wrap evolving here help and throw dummies and steward and they've loved it that it very privy to the place do you know what I mean it's a beautiful place and it's nice to sure often stays to get big crowd it's nice to meet old friends from Europe you know which other lucky the judgments and you look quite a bit and and scanners have been absolutely excellent and most

coming up Gilly is talking summer water work first I am out foxing it's a laid-back cruise around the farms and see what's what with that remarkable true plus-sized somerset ferreters while other families meet up to go to the cinema or the football the families who belong from the south somerset ferreters meet up to go 13 glamping tonight it's dad's night out Jeff is on the rifle and two other south somerset ferreters are in the cab on driving and lamp duty hoping to get a few folks as if you can got a few lambs out not many but farmer wants a cut with poppy shot we've got get a few rabbits for the ferrets as well for food but really mainly foxes really yeah what would it be what are you using what you see with yeah two for free seems a bit overkill but I get two for free cuz it legally a corner can't shoot any deer I can just pop out and shoot deer you know rather than having too many rifles at home that's the photon XT yeah it's right for the money limitations that's why we've got the lamp and the dimmer switch with a red filter which really helps to illuminate there you know the screen and what I can see the infrared on here was just that little bit I painted that little bit too small really the first box pops up quickly Jennifer squeaked it in a bit closer Spencer is a 243 bullet to meet it happy as a dog hop this time again can you tell because is there any way to tell that there's some here not really Charlie to a farmer that dead Fox is it then thoughts where is the vixen or dog Fox is coming in it is a tough question a fox shooter knows the difference between this and this but dog foxes and vixens look the same in the lamp and the night vision Cubs stay on the ground for the first four weeks of their lives if their parents are shot or more likely run over in that time they die the lads spot another Fox and again JAF squeaks it in but in that time you get me squeaker box out which is that thing there yeah yeah it came in quite nice one of you made a noise like a sheep that's me yeah just stop it's fine you know stop it from running towards me yeah it kind of made its combination stop what you don't want to do is getting too close to the truck let me smell you and run off you leave a shout or maybe she'd be noise or make a noise that you're not really familiar with and they will stop and think that the gang go off to fetch it and it turns out to be a well grown Cubs showing what a good breeding season 2017 is turning out to be for foxes yeah but where losses parents might be a bit doubtful I don't know certainly bit losses mum it still survived really you know it has been a good night out with two foxes in the back of the truck for more about the south somerset ferreters search for them on facebook thank you to Jeff and the gang right let's get wet waterworks throughout the spring in particular summer is a really nice way to get your dog fit and had a bit of fun together for a Labrador waterworks is just an essential part of its heritage they have a wonderful thick double coat with an undercoat and a top coat and they also have webbed feet so they are natural water animals however when you're doing your water training in the summer it's important to to try and keep it structured as well as fun so you want to maintain your steadiness you want to work on the delivery of the retrieve coming out of water something we see a lot of is dogs coming out of water and wanting to shake straight away they have got water in their ear it is a bit uncomfortable they are wet but I really want my dog to come to me and deliver before it shakes and the reason for that is potentially if they're shaking with a burden man like either they can let go of it as their head is swinging very quickly from side to side or they can hang on to the bird a bit tightly and possibly damage it so I really work on my delivery from water I always think that the dog sits and drips before I take the retrieve from him with your water worked lovely to get the dog retrieving on the water throw me into the water send the dog fantastic but once the dogs happy entering water and retrieving coming back to you you then really want to concentrate on the dog going over to the far side of water whether it's a river or a lake or pond or canal and that's where you'll see a lot of dogs struggle they're happier retrieving on the water but they're not so confident going over on Powerbank if you have real problems retrieving on the file Bank something that you can do is sit the dog on one side of the water and you walk all the way around to the other side of the water so your opposite the dog and call it to you so the dog is swimming across water but coming towards you rather than going away from you and once you've done that a few times from the dogs confident doing that you can then start retrieving over the water in the same place keep the stretch of water narrow at first don't horse a dog to swim across a reservoir Furyk's first across water swim because it will probably give up and be left with a bad feeling from the experience but a narrow stretch of water and everything should be fine I always try and start my fossils off really early swimming so a three four month old puppy if it's a nice hot summers day bring them down to the lake let them have a bit of a paddle I might even go in myself paddling get the youngster coming in just so they're happy and enjoying it and then later on when you start retrieving in water the puppies had a good first experience and it's really happy to go in and retrieve thank you Gilly now from the wet stuff to the rest of the world of hunting and shooting on YouTube it is hunting YouTube [Music] this is completely it aims to show the best hunting shooting videos

wrong what what Louie don't here", "t-EsyNnzn-M": "so I got a 16 week old black lab pup his name is king and yeah he's been here with me for six weeks when I'm out in public with my dog and people are like I cannot believe your puppy is so well behaved I cannot believe your puppy you know is right there alongside of you and people are just shocked at how my dog responds even at sixteen weeks and honestly I would say that my my dogs very much a puppy and very much gets into trouble and doesn't obey all the time but I think people notice the difference in my dog compared to theirs you know my lab compared to their lab they see just the way it responds away it's trying to learn the way it responds to even clique treat whatever it might be that was really surprising to me and I think for people that are on the fence about cornerstone I think the proofs in the pudding I think you just take you know you'll watch these dogs out in public you know find somebody that maybe has a dog or watch a video online about a dog that's using cornerstone there's a tremendous difference between just the average hunting lab and then a you know a hunting lab that's been you know through the cornerstone program", "HAM9eIAFG6E": "I think somebody likes our toy you're like your toy oh I need a camera welcome to my channel today we are gonna be getting a new puppy and I'm gonna be showing

you stanley no no stanley very good no no stanley no hello baby share and subscribe", "Q0usvmagztc": "hey if you're an avid waterfowl er like I am there's going to be a retrieving dog in your future let me introduce you to the newest member of my hunting party Kansas joi Romanek you know she's just a fuzzball she's only eight weeks old at this point but in just six or seven short months she's going to be a lean mean hunting machine you know when the topic turns to picking out a puppy the most important topic you keep in mind are the pedigrees of the parents you need to make sure you're getting a puppy that comes from a male and a female that both have excellent pedigrees that paperwork proves that both of these dogs have proven themselves as good hunters which means that the puppies the offspring are likely to be good hunters as well in addition to a pedigree it's also important that both the mother and the father our dogs have participated in either hunt tests or field trials contests and field trials are the way that we judge dogs to be able to determine what their hunting skills are if both the parents have great hunting skills we can therefore determine that the puppies will have good hunting skills as well you know Retriever health is also important to understand good breeders take really good care of their pups and make sure that all the details are taken care of make sure that they're getting their Powerball shots their distemper shots make sure that their teeth are in good shape if their eyes and their hips have been certified you know the breed appearance that is and also some little things like do claws and make sure the do claws are removed is very important to do that when they're puppies because it's a more painful operation as an adult you know when you're picking out a pup like this it's important to get it out away from the rest of the litter just take one copy at a time take it out and then you can do a series of tests with that dog and in doing so you can get a pretty good idea of what the dog's personality is when you keep the dogs together as part of the litter it gets really tough to tell which ones have the good personalities and which ones don't because there's just too much interaction going on you know when I'm picking out a pup one of the things I'm looking for is how dominant that dog might be some puppies are very dominant hard to train other dogs are not so dominant and much easier to Train when you take a pup like this typically when you're holding a little tart fussing and stuff one of the things that you can do to check its dominance is you can flip the dog upside-down like this this is a very awkward position the dog settles right down again and that tells you this is a dog that you can get on top of as far as for dominance no words it's not an overly dominant dog if your turn the dog upside down like this and it still fights and fusses then there's a good chance that that dog might be one that's strong-willed and a little bit huffing a little bit tougher the turn here's a simple testing you can use with just a little small bumper to find out just how birdie a dog might be find out if it's got the right tools to become a good dog use this up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up oh good girl here here here here here here here here here here here here up up here you know that's about as good as it gets at eight weeks old we can't expect a puppy to run out get the bumper and bring it back and deliver it to hand but the fact that she went and got it and brought it part way back that's about as good as it gets it shows me she's got some great aptitude probably will be a good choice price is one of those topics that's kind of difficult to cover because good dogs don't necessarily have to be expensive to be good however that stated dogs that come from good pedigrees are likely going to be more expensive than dogs that don't come from good pedigrees so it's worth spending a little extra money and getting a dog it comes from a good pedigree that has a much better chance of turning into being a quality hunting dog you", "PAfK8eCyY1w": "[Music] some people blow their dog whistles more than motorists hit the horn in downtown Manhattan for top gundog trainer Ricky Moloney whistling your dog's is a language the whistle I think isn't all the used tool in the dog trainers doctors armory what I've got is I've got to stop whistle which is one long blah I've got a recall whistle which is a series of peat peeps when I'm working the spaniel I've got a turn whistle so when the spaniel goes so far I just give it a little gentle Pete Pete a lot softer Pete Pete to turn him and hug him back towards me I only increased volume or the distance if the dogs trained on the whistle when I'm working the dog close by should be more than enough when I've got the dog a long way out then any increased volume if the dogs not listening to that soft whistle at that distance it blows on what I do before I even introduced the whistle is and I make sure that the dog understands my herbal commands so when I start introducing the stop whistle the dog already knows sit so as the dogs 6:00 at the side of me and I say sit dogs already started to sit I blow my stop whistle what I also do as well is when I'm actually training the dog to go back or to go left it to go right I blow a stop whistle when the dogs start looking up there because what that stop whistle means if you look at me I'm gonna give you command it's more positive than throwing it away for a dog sending the dog for the dummy and then tried to stop it half way so that stop whistle is actually a positive because the dog knows after that stop whistle to get a command to get the reward Ricky Moloney runs

"hey guys step repeat lows all the next morning of our bill cleaning the bar the chicken farm so I just emptied the water put some new water in there for the fish for our famous fish and brews that we're gonna attempt to do so we're gonna letting another over day until we're done cleaning the barn and now of course we're gonna fill this bad boy up with water of course in the brews so so you're just when I'm putting in there in the bag them in there try that tonight so that's supposed to triple in size Wow our lighting is really bad in here let me see here you can see cover it up with water enough water if it's gonna triple well it's just gonna soak it all up right as long as you just said cover it with water and then it's just gonna soak it all up and then it'll be just sweet okay guys in the barn and we'll put that up show you how we do it three people as oh hey guys slippery Pete Louis all just I'm showing you the second part of the salt the fish and brews are really cooking so you can see here on the right hand side we have our Pollock that we have the yellow bag and then the codfish of course is the red bag so as you can see here we have it for this is what the bag came into thanks to the great grandmother for the grandmother of course to forget that for us to try it out and here I'll show you this of course you can see on the card here let me just see see see nine thousand nine hundred forty milligrams and of course the Paul look it's three thousand one hundred fifty so it's a lot of salt as you can see it's one hundred sixty percent of your daily intake and of course the cod is a four hundred and fourteen percent so that's why you got a silk'n and water obviously folks you can see I'll show you we're preparing this because tomorrow we're cleaning at chicken farm so right now this is a pot full of water as you can see here's the mixture of cod and Pollock that we have in there for the fish letting it soak overnight so you can see just to give you an example how deep it is so it's just it's a decent-sized pot and we're gonna empty that tomorrow morning fill back up with water to get some of the salt out and and then we'll show you the remainder of how we cook fish Andrews guys alright so have a good night we'll see you tomorrow guys we're gonna the other probably just finished cleaning to leave it in the barn almost there so as you can see that bread is a little bit softer now of course it's as you can see I'll show you you can see now it's very you know just falls apart now right so right now I'm gonna start boiling that of course once that's boiling right now I got the fish off the emptied it twice I'm just putting a little water again just to look at the soap and I'm gonna boil that and mark is gonna start cutting that go as close as you can to the fat mark then stop or as you can go because stop yeah because you try to go down to the fat then once you cut down the fat and you flip and you'll cut it sideways makes like little cubes or you can do it like that doesn't this from what she's saying she says normally you just cook the the actual fat the slab the fat in there and it's kind of like it just gives taste but this Myers yeah just cut like that yeah so mark is doing it doesn't rally area he's just cutting it he's gonna cut all in little cubes as you can see guys that's what we're gonna be frying and that's going to be putting over our extensions of course that's what it's called it's gonna be going over our fish and bruise so nothing too complicated just cut in cubes right well let's Dennis Julie yeah so we're just having a little break guys we're having supper after cleaning the barn but we got to go back won't be finished tonight but we're gonna try to get as close as we can so right now he's Cosby's cousin as you have an example what it's what it looks like and then once we start frying it well I show you again what looks like alright guys in a bit alright guys zip repeat lows all right again this is what we're just cooking now the or a temp of our first attempt of fish and brews so here's the brews right here right now we're just warming it up you can see and of course mark added the onions with dysfunctions which is the back beacon and of course myself I'm trying to boil the fish which is Cod and Pollock that we've already drained twice or like for a good amount and then I just drained it to another extra two times just to see to get the some of the salt out you can see it's almost ready guys once it gets to a boil we're gonna drain the water out of the pot here of the bread and then this guy here same thing with the fish remove it mix it and then we're gonna be good to go alright guys I'll show you whenever it's all ready and we put on the plates in a bit guys the repeat losel mark from Denmark grows so if Julie wants to come up she's our video camera today's but and she's gonna take a look at what it looks like now there's the fish right of course the Pollock and Cod when we just drained the water so it's been boiling for about 20 minutes as you can see we just drained the water just mix it all up and there's the bruise to that it's been the minute it got olive oil just rings you can see that the bread is all much stuff yep so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold a bucket mix it in with the fish put on plates and then we're gonna feed everybody mark I'll let you grab please I just yep pull add pour so when we're exciting the brews to the fish Oh she'll give it a good mix now mark or the fish sit up a bit you guys look at de Bru's mixing in with the fish it's just a picture nice and smart a little bit more after give it a good mix I think I made too much bruise but still this Maggert leftovers is always greet with that a lot a bit more leave another it makes a lot of that it's really smelly they're salt fish so the salt is gonna mix in with the bread kind of season the bread all at once so did you want to add more peru's to it or now is I think

there okay so as I go around Pete's gonna go add the scrunch ends you can see guys this was at the back beacon right then we cook with onions I'm putting that on there see there that's not too bad

damaged the films of Cheech and Chong but motion picture historians agree that their movies were destroyed the moment the director yelled action interesting to note that Cheech and Chong were involved

classic movies up and smoke is one of my favorite movies of all time please welcome one of the greatest comedy jewels of all time Cheech and Chong [Applause] what do we start yeah let's start a little bit of our history we go in 1981 I went to go see you at a celebrity basketball game in Malibu yeah and I finally got the nerve to go down and talk to you and I said to you the first thing I ever said to you was hey if you ever need any Latinos for your movies any good-looking ones and do you remember what you said yeah I say you know any that was in 1981 anyone and then I met Tommy like over 20 years ago long time on Ventura Boulevard at a bookstore a magazine where they sold magazines and I saw him and it means like hey man what's going on and I'm like you said you're working I said I was working and I said oh how long have you been working here I don't work here man I do stand-up on the road you think so he thought that we're here so what you know growing up I told you guys how much I love you guys and all of that and up and smoke is a classic so how do you make a classic with three pages of script you improvise a lot [Applause] hey what's your favorite line from from up and smoke hey get in double bubble [Applause] hey man it wasn't a line it was just watching the Ajax woman snores and watching the producers because it was his coke hate so you gave me some some great advice back then back like about 15 almost 20 years ago and where you told me that I needed to get one thing and I couldn't get one thing I was doing clubs and you said get one thing and then I got that movie Bread and Roses yeah and then I called you and he was right after that one thing it turned into all of this skill once and into the next thing I did the next day and he's done it so that's what I did I know you got yeah you got my one please explain everybody how you guys met in Canada in Canada I lived in Canada for three years eventually I made my way to Vancouver where I met Tommy who was running an improv a company in a topless nightclub so was topless improv which was yeah I know it was like what I really boiled down to was hippy burlesque right you know was it was like a burlesque with drugs and rock and roll and did you guys hit it off immediately when you guys well I'd never seen a Mexican before you know Canada we've got Mexicans were guys that were sombreros and leaned against cactus okay and had a burro Pedro takes it world to town and anyway and I didn't and he didn't say that he was a Chicano so we didn't know what he was we both had wood we both had the same reaction we looked at each other what the hell are you I know is are you Mongol or you know Genghis Khan but you're Canadian right yes I am thank God he's Canadian yes but your makes me like all Kaiser why I'm a hybrid what are you doing what are you Janey's Chinese Chinese and scotch-irish I know I don't look Chinese in fact when I go when I go to Vancouver you know sometimes the Chinese immigration guy will stop me and you look at me go what kind of name Tom hey so you know we do DNA tests right really yeah so so here's what we're gonna do we don't like having guys we're gonna have you to do a DNA test oh yeah all right after after you guys are done we're gonna go back there and you're gonna swap I'll get the test if teachers really the father you're done [Music] we might you

your name what's your name at the doors to know your name man his name is", "IEG7vNDUIwc": "these dogs there there's some stuff I want to get into because I know you're I know you're a good trainer and I know you have some specialty stuff that I really want to get into but one of the things that I got asked quite a bit we've we've done a few episodes where we've touched on English cockers and they seem to just generally be getting more popular I don't know if you're seeing that or not I think there's more awareness and yeah I think you know I had somebody asked me the other day like why why would you go with one and I was like well have you met them like you know part of the reason people love golden retrievers is that personality like if you if you're thinking about having an awesome house dog or an awesome companion that golden retriever type personality is so tough to beat and I feel like English cockers are in that realm with just like kind of goofy like love yeah whatever you need boss personality and it's awesome yeah so so the I guess the question is why would anybody get a cocker right sure that's what you're looking for so they're definitely not like a little golden right maybe that personality kind of like that I'm not even sure they definitely are highly intelligent lots of personality dog right they also are they're fairly high energy so if you're looking for just a lap dog they're they're not a lap dog like they like to have a job they I mean you you've seen mine in person like they like to work yep so if they're just laying around all the time they're not especially for that first year or two of their lives they're not really just like good lay around do nothing lap dog there they're definitely a hunting dog like through and through hunting is definitely there that that's their first objective in life there's a little bit and without getting too far into the weeds here there's a lot of speculation on what all is in a cocker from a breeding standpoint because there's definitely been things introduced over the years and none of this is confirmed but it's you know people will say well it's just a miniature Springer right like Springer's and Cochran's used to be the same breed and then the smaller ones became stalkers and the bigger ones became Springer's it makes no sense to me because there's about 20 different colors of cockers and there's two primary colors of springers so something else was introduced there there's certainly some Springer in the cockers there's maybe some Terrier in there there's probably some setter in there there's a lot of speculation that there's probably some border collie in there so there a variety of breeds and then Springer of course as well so if you've been around Border Collies at all and I'm not saying a cocker as a border collie but if that's in there like you know that these dogs like to work and they're highly intelligent so if they have nothing to entertain their mind like they can become destructive dogs like they they find things to do you don't give them something they'll find something so I just certainly wouldn't want your listeners to think boy I just want a nice dog that'll sit on the couch next to me for hours on end and that I can let it out to go pee and it comes back and it lays on the couch again they're not necessarily that dog and I think some like you talked about Golden's I think some of the goldens are more that way where they're just really really laid-back calm dogs the konkurs are definitely more of a working dog than they have they're definitely way higher drive yeah definitely a hard drive but they are like a fun dog but you can't be around them and not just like enjoy them and and have fun with them because they're they're always making you laugh they're goofy like some of them do just the craziest things like what what was that dog thinking like I'll give a story there I have in my basement I had my kennel set up I have 3 foot by 6 foot chain-link runs amongst other things down there and I had a dog at one time as he was a male his name was Sammy he's a couple years old at the time and he figured out how to open up his run which I know a lot of dogs figure out how to open those runs they flip the latch up he was so good at it though like he knew if it was closed or not he knew if there was a snap on it or not if you saw the snap he wouldn't try if the snap wasn't there he would very intentionally open the latch not just a random flail my feet and see if this gate opens like he knew exactly how to open it and it was always nut he was the only dog that did it so it's always hard to remember did we put the snap on his run or not so it's the he caused a lot of heartache that way and what what he ended up doing if he wasn't if the snap wasn't on the latch he would let himself out and then he would go down the line of run and he would let out all the females not the male's just the females and he did this he did this multiple times so that maybe were gone in talent or something we come back and Sammis out in the basement with all the girls and and the other say we have three other males I think at the time the other three males are just sitting in their runs like he's like can't we join the party and Sammy's out they just living it up with with the females and it the first time it happened it was like oh that's pretty funny he let the females out by the third time like he never let another male out ever but he would always let females out that's a to me that's a really like intelligent dog a little bit mischievous but there's a lot of brains behind that to intentionally go do that that's incredible I mean that that the thought behind that to not only get yourself free but then to go yeah none of these things are getting out it's it's gonna be I mean it that's amazing you you said something earlier that I want to just go back and touch on for a second I'll kind of along those lines so when you when you talk about an English Cocker and you look at them they're one of those breeds you know and this is highly subjective but they're cute their whole lives like they're they're all with their adorable dogs when you see an adult English cocker you're like that is it oh it's like an adorable dog and it's little and so do you get people looking for those dogs not for the performance ignoring the drive that the attention needs the the exercise and work that they need just because they look at it and they go oh my god that's a cute dog I want to have those one of those in my house yeah that's definitely yeah and and for those people like if you want a cocker but you don't do anything you have a pretty sedentary lifestyle they just go get a showbread conker at that point you know they still have a nice personality they're gonna be way more relaxed in the house like it'll be a it will be a more rewarding experience for you as an owner if you don't want your dog to do anything now it doesn't mean I'll sell puppies to homes that aren't necessarily hardcore hunting homes you know if you're doing a Jill or you hike a lot or yeah you know whatever you have some activity you want to do with your dog that's fine with me but but I do want my buyers of puppies to know like this is a dog that's gonna require something in its life like don't get it just to be a lap dog yep so can I go I'm gonna go back and finish that thought earlier like why would somebody buy a Cocker sure if that's all right because I feel like I left that open a little bit so if I were recommending a cocker to somebody the reason would be one it is like a really fun dog to have around a lot of personality they're cool dog for sure they're a cool dog from a hunting perspective so my background like I talked about earlier was retrievers upland hunting with retrievers the Cocker's in my opinion are a better upland dog than a Retriever in most cases certainly there's exceptions to it they cover ground better they're more fun to watch that they're flashy dog they most of them are pretty natural retrievers like really natural at retrieving good noses like they've got good trailing ability they're just out there really really nice hunting dog so not when I originally bought a cocker it was because I lived in an apartment didn't have space now I live out in the country I've got land all around me I've got kennels yeah I have a lot more space and I could go get any breed of dog that I wanted to I am getting a couple of labs for different reasons I have no desire to replace my cockers as upland hunting dogs with another breed because they they do everything that I want them to do so it's a super nice hunting dog that's also in a small package with a lot of personality yep and on your point earlier that you know they're they're working dogs they need jobs like you said if they've got some collie in there and you've seen up if you've seen a collie work you understand this but in in general terms working dog sporting dogs need jobs they thrive with a structured life where they have tasks to accomplish and it doesn't like you said it doesn't have to be hunting pheasants you know adventure dogs I was talking to Mike Stewart with Wild Rose kennels the other day I was interviewing him for a me article and he was talking about how many adventure dogs they're training now to kayak and to hike and to just be outdoors with people not in a hunting capacity just just working doing cool stuff then if you if you want an English cocker any other dog that has been bred to for a task or multiple tasks don't don't get him and ask him to sit on the couch take them up and work them work because that's what they need that's what they love that's what they're there for that's right so I always yeah I know you do I always I always like to touch on that so you've said several times that you you know you were living in Iowa when you picked up your first English cocker you were looking for an upland hunter you thought you think they perform better than retrievers in that capacity does anybody is anybody duck hunting with these things do you know anybody out there yeah definitely I've done a little bit of duck hunting with mine although that is it's been a while it's not really my thing right now at this point in my life but most of them like very readily take to the water and I can do when I focus on doing blinds like Rocky was that that first dog I started trialing he was I put a lot of time into him with handling stuff and I could easily do 150 yard blind with that dog I could handle him I could I could you know do launch a dummy 70 yards out into a lake and send him for it you he would go out there retrieve it for me so and they certainly can pick up a duck as well no problem at least most of them can they aren't great in cold water late season so if you're planning on going to a big lake that maybe has some Whitecaps coming in and you're gonna be dumping a bunch of ducks out there that that's not what they're intended for right that's it's a little bit too much for them yep if it's early season teal hunting or wood duck or puddle jumping that it's a great application for them so as long as your expectations are reasonable you know if it's a maybe you're hunting ducks over corn or something like that yeah great for that it's just a late season if they're gonna have to sit there while they're what their bodies not made for that yeah so on that note you know if you if if somebody's thinking about an English cocker and they're like oh I hunt early and wood ducks on small water or whatever you know you still have to do a water introduction with them you know you have to get them introduced to the water correctly so would you say just be a little more careful about the water introduction with them so the water temp is good the experience is positive because the water introduction thing you know a lot of people take it for granted with dogs if you get a lab or something you just think hey that that dogs gonna take to water sometimes they don't you know sometimes they jump off the dock and go in over their head and fifty degree water and they go uh this is not for me and it changes them for life so you have to be carried out so I I look at water introduction the same way I look as at intro intro to gunfire most cockers like any breed any honey breed would be totally fine with water know how much juice no matter how much you screwed it up right they just they'll just take to it but there are gonna be some that and you know maybe they're not just as fond of it as others so it's better to just be safe and introduce them all in the same way so what's the point of trying to get a puppy to swim in cold water if you could wait a month and put them in warm water might as well make it as fun for them as possible and you may be able to throw a retrieve off of a Ledge and have a puppy jump in and retrieve it but maybe not so you might as well start them all off with a nice sloping Bank where they can touch the bottom for the first few feet and then they lose the bottom and they start swimming so it's just it's safer so the same as intro to gunfire most dogs you could go out there and flush the bird and shoot it and that dogs not even gonna hear the gunfire and it's just gonna go retrieve the bird right but there are gonna be some puppies that stop and say what the heck was that that terrified me I don't ever want to hear that again and now you've got all that extra work to break it a dog that so it's way better to just gradually teach water the same way that you would gradually teach intro to gunfire yep well in a those two things are pretty commonly associated with lessons with a dog that if you screw them up coming back from them is not alright but can be a monumental task and you know we know that with gunfire you know if you screw that up it's you may have a dog that you'll never hunt with it may go that bad the the water introduction doesn't usually carry as much weight with people especially if you if you bought a dog like this where you're like oh you know I love to hunt pheasants I love to hunt grouse whatever maybe I'll hunt some ducks and so you might not take it as seriously but either it's a good thing it's an easy thing to do correctly if you follow the steps and you make sure the introduction is there's no fear there's not gonna be any fear it's a simple thing they can get into and it's comfortable you just just remember that what you know no matter what kind of dog you're trying to introduce to those things that's right yeah the the risk reward is so heavily weighted toward just do it right like you know you might come out okay by taking shortcuts but it's almost guaranteed you'll come out okay if you do it the right way so just do it the right way yeah for sure have you um just just because for my own curiosity do you have anybody who's shed hunting with English cockers I do I have one dog that I sold that I went to a couple in the Midwest and they actually use it in the shed dog competition then oh okay think that's the only one that I know of but I'd say like six years ago if somebody asked me if the doctor these cockers could do that and I had I had Rocky at the time and I took it so I was like well I was gonna showed it show them that these dogs could find sheds I took like 20 minutes to teach him to retrieve antlers and then I started hiding antlers in the woods and he was finding them so really any dog that has high retrieve driving a nose is gonna you can turn that into a shed dog pretty easily yep yeah I think you know we get asked about it a lot and I just think shed dog training is generally way easier than a lot of other kinds of training so yeah yeah you're not even asking them to stay at a certain distance or anything I just your and if you smell antlers bring up dude hey God let's smell or see them I mean they learn they learn the visual side of it too but it's just it's such an easy hunt to set up you know in the neighborhood park in the backyard you can't do the average person can't set up a real pheasant hunt or oh you know like a 90% of the way to a real pheasant hunt all that easily you can set up a shed hunt in like you said no time at all and I'm when what you said there about taking 20 minutes to teach Rocky how to how to find antlers you said something about him way back in this conversation about how you would you know introduce something to that in five minutes later it was like he's got it yeah and I I meant to ask you about that how did you know was it just through sheer repetition in the following days that you you figured out that wasn't a false positive yeah at the time I had no clue what I was doing um now I ball the spot I don't really ever think of false positives I guess because the way that I do things now it's very incremental and they show me that they understand it before we go on to the next thing and if they show me that they understand it which means they'll do it without being forced to do it like then then I know they have it so so I found actually and this is complete going into the weeds here but I found that and I think maybe in the second half of this podcast we'll talk about this a little bit more but I found that early on when I forced dogs to do things so either by restraint or by correction those those lessons did not stick as well like they would forget about that restraint or they would forget about that correction and I had to always go back and do these things over and over and over again and before a competition I was always I was training right up until the last minute just hoping that the lesson stuck long enough to carry through a field trial and my training is definitely evolved now to where it's let's let's let the dog take some ownership of this process and some of the onus for doing it correctly I guess and that's this is really in all I've listened to a lot of your podcasts where it's like you had the border collie guy yawn and you've had the the drug detection and all that and these these we're all kind of doing the same thing in that now we're really trying to get dogs to where they want to do these jobs because of the reward that's at the end so they're very focused on doing it the right way and if because they want the reward not because they're afraid of a correction and I found that by doing it that way these lessons stick so much better where I can take a Finnish dog put it away for two or three weeks bring it back out and it's like the dog never took any time off it picks up right where it left off because it's engaged in the game it's a game for it right it knows how it's supposed to do it knows how to win the game so it comes out and it wants to win the game it's not jerking my chain and it's not forgetting about a correction that happened it's remembering the positive thing at the end so you this that's interesting so do you think they're learning I don't I don't know if this is the right way to put this or not do you think when you when you're doing you're structuring your training so it's a positive confidence-building thing where they they know the reward is gonna be there in a positive way versus being afraid of a correction that they're like those lessons are sticking better like it's it almost sounds like they're learning differently through that hundred percent okay yes yes for sure for sure you know you'll find like they they're more engaged in the process and it's not coming from a position of fear or a strain it's coming from a position of like you you look at these drug dogs and why are they doing that job like why are they going in sniffing for marijuana isn't it because they like marijuana maybe I don't know but they may but what they're really doing is they want the tennis ball at the end I know if I find that I get the tennis ball so I'm gonna go look for that stuff as hard as I can knowing when I find it I get the reward at the end go when you take that same principle and apply it to a hunting dog if we can teach that dog that when it does the right thing it gets a reward at the end now it's gonna like and once they figure that gig out then they boy the faster I can do my job the right way the pastor I'm gonna get my reward mm-hmm and it sticks well and so what what is neat about that is I think you would think that the average dog trainer would look at this and go the quickest way from point A to point B is gonna be to correct just just drive this frickin lesson home make it stick and that will be the most efficient way to make this dog listen and you're saying actually it's more efficient to figure out how to work with their natural desire to please and learn and get rewarded and that actually becomes not only a better way get those lessons to stick but a more efficient way to train yeah definitely and I I'm not uh I'm not advocating like no correction type training my dogs all have received Corrections now the corrections are different for each dog some need more some need less but we're I'm always trying to get them back to a place of learning and being rewarded you don't want to dwell in a constant state of Correction and restraint we go there just so that we have a contrast what's what's positive rightly like a positive reward is only positive because of what a negative is it's it's all relative so we do have to show them hey if you want to play the game your way you get this correction if you'll play it my way you get this reward at the end it doesn't take a real smart dog to figure that concept out that hey if I play it this way I get that reward if I play it the other way there's a correction that comes well let's not go there let's just stay where it's happy and positive", "yPj1LaB9tuo": "hey what's going on everyone today I'll be covering eight must know tips when buying dog food believe it or not there's a ton of misleading marketing in the dog food industry and while you think you might be a hundred percent sure you're buying what your pet needs these tips might make you reconsider be sure to watch the whole way through as this small time investment can make a huge impact on your dog's health generally speaking these tips mainly cover premium options that run a few dollars per pound of food think origin Rachael Ray Blue Buffalo and brands in that price range anyways let's jump into it tip number one don't look at the pictures look at the ingredients it's easy to get distracted looking at the fancy packaging full of chicken fruits vegetables and the happy dog running through a field most of what you see on the front is a marketing ploy here's why pet foods in the United States are regulated by the FDA and generally speaking when it comes to the images on the packaging the rules are pretty open while manufacturers have to follow basic guidelines such as listing the ingredients the distributor that quantity etc there's room for the rules to be bent for example look at what appears on the front of this package lots of fruits vegetables meats etc this leaves the consumer to believe the food is packed full of only healthy fruits and vegetables and none of the other bad stuff well that's obviously false at least for a lot of dog foods the ingredients are listed from greatest to least so the first item you see is what makes up the largest percentage of the food the second item is what makes up the second largest for example if the ingredients listed are chicken sweet potatoes lentils the percentages could be 30 17 and 15 percent then any ingredients that make up less than 15% are listed after so while you might see mounds of spinach carrots and other nutrient-rich items these can sometimes make up less than 1% of the overall mix tip number 2 look for whole ingredients by no means do I consider myself an expert in dog food however I've spent way too much time this during research on what is considered safe and nutritious for your dog along with this I've been diving through the FDA's and Affco guidelines and regulations and combing through pages and pages of information here's what you need to know everything in your pets food is generally considered safe and has a purpose although the effectiveness of each ingredient does not have to meet a certain minimum threshold for example corn versus sweet potatoes both act as a carbohydrate source but asking which is better is difficult corn is likely a cheaper ingredient and is more attractive to the manufacturers in this aspect but maybe not so much for you or your dog let's take a step back for a moment since dogs don't have the opportunity to vary their food source they have to rely on their owners to provide them a complete and balanced diet go to the store buy nearly anything off the shelf and in every bite of dog food it's considered a complete source meaning it has everything your dog needs to grow live and just generally be healthy so in every bite your dog needs protein carbs fats vitamins minerals etc minimum and maximum standards are set by Affco for nearly all manufacturers cost of materials or ingredients is the largest expense if a manufacturer can save a few pennies by using corn over sweet potatoes then making up the nutrient deficiency with an artificial additive then these savings is multiplied over millions of pounds of food thus increasing profit margins this is a bit of an oversimplified example but it's also part of the reason there's so many different options out there each recipe is different and there's tons of room for variants the bottom line is the more whole ingredients the better one new dog food company that is big on nutritious and whole food ingredients backed by some big names including the fresh prince himself Will Smith along with Nas palsy and even Michael Strahan Dizz jinx jinx dog food is a modern brain formulated for the modern dogs your dog isn't a wolf and you aren't a caveman your pub doesn't have to spend all day searching for food or recovering from long periods without food jinkx is a smarter formula for the dog that goes on daily walks and sleeps while you're at work I've been feeding my dog grease the chicken brown rice avocado formula for several weeks now and I've noticed a significant difference in the softness of his coat and his overall energy levels it makes sense - I was feeding in the Costco brand food and after looking at the ingredients on jinkx there is a significant difference if you want to learn more about jinkx and if it's appropriate for your dog I've included a link below anyways let's get on with the rest of the video [Music] number three be weary of other YouTube videos again I don't consider myself an expert but I do want to scrutinize the reliability and validity of things I see online two common things you'll see on YouTube include a vinegar test and the one percent salt divider rule the vinegar test is meant to show the digestibility of food and your dog stomach by replicating stomach acid here's the problems I see with it one your dog is usually up and walking around not sitting as still as those glasses on camera two your dog has teeth and saliva that helps to break down the food before it enters the stomach and three your dog's stomach has muscles that help to move the predigested food around for further breakdown these tests are far from realistic even if the pH is set correctly in my opinion in regards to the one percent salt divider rule I was having a tough time finding any information online there's all sorts of websites that refer to this but none link a credible source back to aapko or the FDA here's what I found on an app code document now I'm not gonna sit here and read this because it's really only a short paragraph but it's confusing right but my formal chemistry education stopped not long after high school so maybe I'm reading this wrong but I do not see a maximum set on these guidelines for a sodium or chloride just a ratio so I contacted the FDA here's the response I received again not a whole lot of clarity for the time being I'm skeptical and as of publishing this video I'm still seeking out additional information and not to be hypocritical but scrutinize my video to yes I am endorsing a specific brand of dog food and I do receive a small commission if you use my link to purchase but this is for all the dog foods listed in the description am I biased of course I'm a visualised I'm not making these videos and doing all of this research just to do research so even though the benefit is small I want to make a little bit of a return on my time investment that's why I have all of these links set up below besides Reese gets more treats and toys when I put links up that people buy through it doesn't cost you anything extra but I might receive a buck or two for referring the sale there's no point in lying or modifying information to try and get you to buy one food over the other the monetary benefit on my end is negligible and while we story short take everything with a grain of salt spend your time doing your own research and remember that every dog is unique know something I don't please comment below and include a reliable source rather than just some anecdotal evidence tip number four check the recall list the FDA releases recalls for all dog and cat foods while these recalls are specific to single brands product lines and batches you can use them to gauge the trustworthiness of a brand although use caution with your judgments these recalls are voluntary for example if there are brands that consistently appear on the recall list you can look at this one of two ways you could say a brand is staying proactive and taking the appropriate cautionary measures when there is reason to believe a batch may need to be recalled on the flip side of brain may be publishing a recall only because the monetary loss from legal disputes and other repercussions outweighs what it would cost to simply remove the food from shelves oftentimes it's some combination of all of those factors most manufacturers have some sort of routine quality testing which is most likely what initiates these recalls others may be the result of field complaints where quality testing did not catch the bad batch just remember to see what the recalls are for a reoccurring problem signals to me that management may not be taking care of problems with personnel or processes to ensure food is safe tip number five grains aren't all bad if you walk into any pet food store you'll find plenty of options advertising grain free is there any benefit to grain free there's some and there's plenty of other videos that covered grain free diets more in detail but the main reason is you're typically buying a more nutrient-dense product when it's grain free most lower end and economic dog food options have their first or second ingredient as cornmeal or something similar don't count out all grains is bad though certain grains like whole grains are a good source of complex carbs that are a part of a healthy diet unless your dog has a grain allergy some grains won't hurt most modern dog foods use sweet potatoes vegetables and other ingredients that contain more vitamins and minerals with a similar amount of carbs tip number six go the DIY route or try a 50/50 blend if you're having trouble finding a store-bought food that works try going the homemade route while it takes some time and can get pricey this gives you the peace of mind of knowing what exactly goes in your dog's food if it's too expensive or you're limited on time you can always make a half homemade half store-bought mix in fact this may be how you want to start especially if you're switching over to a homemade mix from a store-bought mix there are plenty of recipes online you can find that meet all of your dog's nutrient and caloric needs tip number seven work with your vet your vet might be able to save you a lot of time if your dog has a food allergy your vet may be able to test for that so you don't have to run through trial-and-error with so many different foods or recipes talk with your vet about your concerns and possible solutions tip number eight dog food isn't everything related to your pet's health generally speaking when people are concerned with what their dog is eating their concerns because they want their dog to have a high quality happy and long life don't forget that while their food is a big part of their life so is adequate exercise and love and attention be aware of the issues that are common with your dog's breed doing when you came today to help mitigate and prevent these issues in the future will likely make your dog's life a lot better in the long run doing what you can today to help mitigate or prevent these issues will probably make a greater difference in your dog's overall happiness than what they're eating today if you made it to the end of this video thank you for watching the entire way through be sure to visit thank Dinks com linked in the description and comments below as they provided Reese some treats and dog food for him to try out which and

but uh we got wit chucks we should have a bunch of them coming out here I got the GoPro set up over a hole down there so I'm crossing my fingers that one comes out we should get some cut killing in today we'll see what happens here we've got a bunch of spectators and screaming they seem to be really interested in yeah [Music] [Music] get right under one down here on the corner I'll tell you when I'm right okay your rifle set up Zack first 270 okay let them have it whatever whoa [Music] that pissed me off well give everybody a little update I just pounded that Chuck down here at 480 490 yards a little bit ago Zane shot one over here 2:45 yes 240 240 ish and thank-thanks velocity on his rounds are clearing so he's not very consistent right now but Zach will kill one before the day is over how many bullets you have Zach okay he'll go on now we're just waiting on another Chuck to come out we'll keep watch for pigeons - Zane Zane let one rip for the pigeons shot just under - look like [Music] 245 [Music] who's shootin eggs actually let it turn sideways so you got a little more room for air is that okay [Music] oh hey I didn't try to blow this back do you really you got it they shot Zack you're on the board [Music] yep Oh Oh smoke them use a man Zack now you got it gone dialling myself my phone says and then I'm aiming right over the back it's working that's two in a row now well I'll give everybody a little update we've been here a little over an hour now and we got a total of six woodchucks dead and I just smacked one at 550 yards and Zane just killed the little baby he missed earlier and Zach don't another one off that corner and you guys just watched all those kills straight before I just told you that so we're still waiting on more trucks coming out it's a bad day to be a Chuck on the Bailey farm [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so I see all privileged dismiss that woodchuck to wear charge right here on the fence poles for the best line closest woodchuck would shy at all night I smoked my first two first one is at 470 those tight one was at 550 of course I mystical just one so I'll ever play ten push-ups we've had cava wall here we have its community woodchucks in the past ten minutes hopefully you get anybody wearing it [Music] well we had a pretty good wall right there but we just had a chunk come out out here at 500 yards and I got my rifle all set up and smacked them so unfortunately Jack got a bullet again so we're going to wait here and see what else comes out looks like we might have a little rain coming in but that'll be good to get these woodchucks out I think we're having a bit of a lull right now and the woodchuck activity so I'm going to take you guys on a flight tour with a drone to check out some of these Chuck's we've killed today so I hope you enjoy your flight we'll see you later [Music] you [Music] Zane Zack and I came up here to our farm today and this week a still got mode and there's woodchucks all over it so we said to set up up there I had my three hard Win Mag Jane has two two three you had your 25.6 so the woodchucks really has Spanish hands the part is Chuck we killed was at 550 yards and that was this headshot right there and then the next part is two or five hundred yards right in the back of this field and they were lying 5 feet from each other it's kind of funny and then these guys chimed in with some baby kills but we had a blast and these woodchucks are a real nuisance to the farmers around here they dig holes all over their crop fields and in their pastures and they're just a big problem and and we couldn't be happier to help them out by killing them we're going to get some more rounds reloaded and get back out here and continue to kill them so I really appreciate you guys

to be how are you feeling I'm feeling great that's the reason we asked you had the prostate cancer a few years ago yeah yep still have still have in remission mm-hmm okay and now you have yeah rectal rectal culated yeah is it real no apparently not apparently not I look at the body you know like a car you know I'm an old car now I got a little rust in the exhaust pipe that's about it you're you're in your 70s right yeah yeah almost 80 almost really kitty close getting close now you've been I know you've been really vocal about how you're using even a cannabis suppositories right and how would that helped or do you think that's hurt oh no dog helps little helps well first of all it's not when you do suppositories you don't get the head high you know you get a little but I but no way okay whatever that is oh it's good but highs good because you can still sing I know people who graduated from bud high no but no no the cannabis oil is is I think cannabis oil has really kept me from mark kept me healthy kept me young you know kept me undone Singh with the Stars you were amazing you brought your swag to that did you had you danced before then uh you know I learned how to dance salsa you know I had to pick my pencil salsa dance so we're watching you hear the state of your health then was what I had cancer all right at that point I think I think probably is you know this my own opinion the stress of the show probably brought writers write it out and it is just it is stressful touches father it's stressful seven days a week rehearsals like four five hours a day rehearsal is did you know your cancer like that had you been getting your colonoscopies did you know for three years that was that was the problem yeah but they give you a propofol I'm surprised you want to do it Tommy on a serious note here you have always been in the forefront of saying let's legalize marijuana yes it's a ridiculous thing if Mara would start out another way marijuana would be legal and alcohol wouldn't be etcetera etcetera yeah what are your doctors say when you talk to them every doctor the straight doctors and the hip doctors they all the straight doctors they don't discourage it I tell them I'm treating the cancer with with marijuana and they go okay let's see what happens you know the the the cancer I mean the marijuana doctor like there's a dr. Frankel he's been researching and he's one of the top Marijuana doctors in in the world actually he encourages the use of the cannabis oil with cancer for a number of reasons you know and and how does the medical profession officially look at this officially what depends in in Israel there's research going where they've done great strides dr. Sanjay Gupta did a great show on CNN where they showed the cannabis oil actually curing a little girl's epilepsy a little girl had hep-c these are episodes but what about the medical establishment it would say to you what well the medical establishment really don't know they don't know no more than anybody else the medical establishment it when you see the establishment the ones that push pharmaceutical the AMA for instance yeah yeah the one they're way behind the curb you know we were there they don't even allow marijuana research the federal government does it so so I mean they're behind but we're you you know this stuff to be blurry well we call Big Pharma in the pharmaceutical industry are they waiting for the total legalization do they already have I don't know what Varma's not waiting for anybody don't way ahead of the game yes so they they're ready to go as a product much as it can the United States government tried to patent or did patent marijuana years ago when they made it legal because illegal because American government knew at that time knew the medical benefits and and and the reason it was made illegal was pure political you know and racist it's a marijuana laws are very racist there's no probably the only blatant racist law that we have you know and and the reason I say that is before it was called marijuana it was called hemp and was growing all over the world especially in in America there's hemp Bill Hempstead there's him towns named after so people in Long Island who live in Hempstead don't know they live in marijuana stead that's what she said that's right interesting thought a lot of them don't okay it's not like you've dedicated your life to the pursuit of marijuana but I have but but you have and and the interesting thing is that I think most people back in the 70s and early 80s would have thought that you wouldn't be alive now that's right that's right and you've outlasted a lot of those people absolutely because of the the marijuana you think I'm like I say I'm almost 80 years old mm-hmm I still do everything that I did when I was 40 you know everything about about this prognosis the doctors feel confident when you're in there doctors are very very confident but with me it's stage one it's not that serious I'm going to treat it with like I say with marijuana and radiate chemo radiation right yeah and the chemo and the radiation the good thing about marijuana what marijuana does more than anything it relaxes the mind and it relaxes the anxiety and when you relax anything then things get done you know it relaxes the immune system so the immune system will will take over you know because we don't when we have illnesses in that you know the doctors can only do so much doctors are like mechanics they can fix things that are broken but they can't really keep you from getting the disease unless you you treat your body like like a car and you make sure you know what you're putting into it you know like good nutrition exercise and marijuana all right so we have to go you're going to come back next year after your on so you think it can dance after all this time we'll good to see Tommy John thank you very

INDUSTRY TO BE DISRUPTED BUT I DO THINK THAT A BIT OF THIS IS A PAY TO TRY TO CLAW BACK THE MARKET SHARE THAT'S BEEN LOST. >> SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE NOT PAYING THE TOURISM MARKETING LEVY. THAT'S $300,000 THAT COULD BE PUT INTO MORE MARKETING FOR TOURISM IN THE CITY. >> Ariana: HOW CLOSELY SHOULD AIRBNB BE REGULATED? SOME GROUPS CALLED FOR REGULATIONS AND NOW ST.

THE CITY OF ST. JOHN'S SAY THAT USERS IN AIRBNB DON'T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. >> Carolyn: THEY ARE CALLING TO BRING IN REGULATIONS TO FIX THAT. MARK QUINN IS STANDING BY LIVE. SO, MARK, WHAT IS THE MAYOR SAYING? >> Reporter: WELL, MAYOR DANNY BREEN SAYS THAT THE CITY IS MISSING OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT A LOT OF MONEY AND HE SAYS IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T COLLECT A TAX FROM PEOPLE WHO RENT AIRBNBs, IT'S CALLED THE TOURISM MARKETING LEVY, THAT THEY DON'T COLLECT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF AIRBNB RENTALS HERE IN ST. JOHN'S BUT THE PEOPLE WHO RENT THEM DON'T PAY THE SAME TAX THAT PEOPLE WHO STAY IN PLACES LIKE THIS DO. PEOPLE HERE WANT THAT TO CHANGE. >> THE SAME THAT YOU WOULD PAY AT A HOTEL OR A BED AND BREAKFAST AND IT'S IMPORTANT OF FUNDING THE TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE CITY. >> Reporter: RIGHT NOW THE TOURISM TAX BRINGS IN ABOUT $3 MILLION FOR THE CITY EVERY YEAR. THAT MONEY HELPS TO PAY FOR THE CONVENTION CENTRE AND THE CITY'S TOURISM MARKETING. THE CITY SAYS THAT AIRBNB USERS SHOULD PONY UP FOR THOSE THINGS TOO. >> THE AIRBNB OR THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL MARKET AVAILS OF BOTH OF THOSE SERVICES AND, THEREFORE, WE FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD BE PAYING THE 4% TOURISM MARKETING LEVY. >> Reporter: THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT REGULATING AIRBNBs OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS BUT THIS AIRBNB HOST SAYS, SLOW DOWN. HE SAYS THAT THE CITY SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE THEY ACCUSE AIRBNB RENTERS OF NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. >> GENERALLY PEOPLE WHO STAY ON THAT PLATFORM STAY LONGER AND SPEND MORE MONEY, AGAIN, AS MUCH AS TWO TIMES. I THINK THAT THE NUMBER IS 41% OF THE MONEY THEY SPEND IS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN WHICH THEY STAY. >> Reporter: NOW THE CITY SAYS THAT THERE'S ABOUT 700 AIRBNB RENTALS AVAILABLE IN THE ST. JOHN'S AREA. WE HAVE ASKED THE PROVINCE IF THEY PLAN TO CHANGE THE RULES THAT THOSE AIRBNBs PLAY BY BUT THE PROVINCE HASN'T RESPONDED YET. LIVE IN ST. JOHN'S, I'M MARK QUINN FOR \"HERE & NOW.\" >> Carolyn: THE HOTEL ASSOCIATION HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE GUIDELINES FOR AIRBNB. YOU HAVE HEARD FROM BRANDON COPELAND THERE WHO OWNS AN AIRBNB RENTAL. HE'S CONCERNED THAT THE RESEARCH AROUND THE GUIDELINES DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS PROVINCE. WE'LL HAVE THAT INTERVIEW IN HALF AN HOUR ON \"HERE & NOW.\" >> Ariana: WELL, IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE THE REMNANTS OF HURRICANE MATTHEW STRUCK THE SOUTH COAST OF NEWFOUNDLAND. AND LIFE IN SOME TOWNS STILL ISN'T BACK TO NORMAL. IN ST. ALBANS, THE ROADWORK HAS BECOME A HEADACHE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. \"HERE & NOW'S\" GARRETT BARRY EXPLAINS. >> Reporter: THE FINAL TOUCHES. 22 MONTHS LATER THESE ROADS ARE FINALLY REBUILT. BUT LOOK CLOSER -- IT'S STARTING TO SHOW. >> THE WINDS AND RAINS ARE BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE ACCORDING TO, YOU KNOW, THE WEATHER PATTERNS. >> Reporter: WASHED AWAY IN 2016, THIS PAVEMENT WAS LAID LAST YEAR. >> WHAT WE NOTICED IS THAT THE SHOULDERS OF THE ROADS WAS WASHING AWAY BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE RAIN. >> Reporter: THE MAYOR SAYS THAT CURBS AND DITCHES COULD HELP, BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM -- THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT'S DISASTER RELIEF PROGRAMME IS FUNDING THE REBUILD AND SHE SAYS THAT IT WON'T PAY FOR THAT TYPE OF WORK. >> FROM WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD NUMEROUS TIMES IS THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED IS ONLY TO PUT THE ROADS BACK TO THE WAY THAT THEY WERE. >> Reporter: THE DEPARTMENT OF MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS HELPS TO MANAGE THE PROGRAMME. IT TOLD US THAT CURBS AND DITCHES COULD BE COVERED BUT IN THIS CASE IT DOESN'T MEET THE PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS. THERE'S NO CASH. >> THERE MIGHT BE A NEED TO IMPROVE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT PROGRAMME BECAUSE AS MUNICIPALITIES WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT WITH THE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERNS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE RAIN, WE'RE GETTING MORE WIND AND SO ON. >> Reporter: SO MAYBE IT'S OKAY TO SAY THAT THE ROAD WORK PROJECT COULD BE IMPROVED. FAIR ENOUGH. BUT AT LEAST IT'S BEING DONE. THAT'S MORE THAN YOU COULD SAY FOR SOME PROJECTS IN THESE PARTS. ON THIS DAY NO MOVEMENT... THE CONTRACTOR IS WAITING FOR CONCRETE GERTERS TO SET SO THE DRIVERS ARE USING THIS. >> IT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME NOW AND THE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS FEEL THAT THE NEW BRIDGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WELL CONSTRUCTED BY NOW. >> Reporter: THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND WORKS IS IN CHARGE OF THIS PROJECT.

ALBANY. >> Reporter: A LOT OF FOREST WAS DESTROYED IN A FIRE EARLIER THIS YEAR BUT SOME TREE PLANTING BEGAN TODAY. >> THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT OF SORT OF PEATY SOIL UNDERNEATH THAT I THINK THAT THESE TREES WILL DO REALLY WELL WITH. >> A LITTLE BIT OF A POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM THE COMMUNITY SO THAT'S BEEN KIND OF GREAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME TOGETHER. >> Reporter: I'M JEREMY EATON AND I'LL HAVE THAT STORY COMING UP. >> Ariana: THE RACE TO FILL THE VACANCY CREATED BY THE RESIGNATION OF CATHY BENNETT IS TRY STARTING TO HEAT UP. CHES CROSBIE IS OUT KNOCKING ON DOORS IN THE ST. JOHN'S DISTRICT. AND NOW THE LIBERALS OFFICIALLY HAVE A CANDIDATE. HIGH-PROFILE ST. JOHN'S BUSINESSMAN PAUL ANTLE. \"HERE & NOW'S\" TERRY ROBERTS IS FOLLOWING THAT STORY TODAY AND IS JOINING US LIVE FROM THE NEWSROOM. TERRY? >> Reporter: YES, ARIANA, WELL, TODAY IT BECAME OFFICIAL, CATHY BENNETT IS NO LONGER THE M.H.A. FOR WINDSOR LAKE. SHE ANNOUNCED HER DEPARTURE THREE WEEKS AGO WITH JUST A TWEET, LEAVING POLITICS AFTER LESS THAN A TERM IN OFFICE. ONE THAT WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR HER CONTROVERSIAL TIME AS FINANCE MINISTER AND FOR HER STRONG ADVOCACY AGAINST HARASSMENT IN POLITICS AND IN THE WORKPLACE AND ONLINE BULLYING. SO NOW THE FOCUS SHIFTS TO WHO WILL REPLACE BENNETT IN THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY AND THIS MAN, P.C. LEADER CHES CROSBIE, HAS ALREADY BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR A WEEK. HUNGRY TO EARN LEGITIMACY AHEAD OF NEXT YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION. AT THE HELM FOR LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS, CROSBIE ADMITS THAT HIS AUTHORITY TO LEAD THE P.C.s WOULD BE WOUNDED IF HE FAILS TO WIN A SEAT. >> WELL, I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE PROVINCE THAT THE P.C. PARTY THAT I WIN THIS BY-ELECTION BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY A DRESS REHEARSAL WITH MOST OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE'LL SEE PLAYED OUT NEXT YEAR IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. SO IN THAT SENSE THIS IS A CRITICAL BY-ELECTION. IT'S GOING TO TELL US WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT, THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT, UNDER MR. BALL HAS A FUTURE IN THAT. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A BELL WEATHER FOR WHETHER THE P.C. PARTY WILL FORM THE NEXT GOVERNMENT. >> Reporter: NOW I ASKED MR. CROSBIE TODAY JUST WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU LOSE IN WINDSOR LAKE. HE SAID HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO ENTERTAIN THAT PROSPECT. BUT HE'S TOLD OTHER MEDIA THAT HE WILL SIMPLY WALK AWAY FROM POLITICS. NOW, MEANWHILE THIS IS SHAPING UP TO BE REALLY A HEAVYWEIGHT CONTEST. THE NOMINATIONS CLOSE THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE LIBERAL PARTY. AND PAUL ANTLE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO STEP FORWARD. ABTEL HAS STRONG BUSINESS CREDENTIALS AND HE FINISHED A STRONG SECOND TO LORRAINE MICHAEL OF THE N.D.P. IN ST. JOHN'S EAST-QUIDI VIDI IN THE ELECTION AND BEHIND PREMIER DWIGHT BALL IN A CROWDED FIELD DURING THE 2013 LEADERSHIP RACE. ANTLE IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK WITH THE MEDIA ON WEDNESDAY WHEN HE LAUNCHES HIS CAMPAIGN. NOW I DID SPEAK TO SOME OFFICIALS WITH THE N.D.P. TODAY. THEY SAID THEY HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN REPRESENTING THE PARTY IN WINDSOR LAKE. NOW THAT DISTRICT IS VACANT, THE RULES SAY THAT THE BY-ELECTION MUST BE CALLED WITHIN 60 DAYS AND A VOTE MUST BE HELD WITHIN 95 DAYS, BUT DON'T EXPECT TO HAVE TO WAIT THAT LONG. PREMIER DWIGHT BALL HAS SIGNALLED THAT HE WANTS THIS THING DONE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND I'M TOLD THAT THE VOTERS IN WINDSOR LAKE COULD BE CASTING BALLOTS AS SOON AS EARLY OCTOBER. LIVE FOR \"HERE & NOW\" I'M TERRY ROBERTS. >> Ariana: THANKS, TERRY. >> AN OVERWHELMING OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT HAS FOLLOWED THE SUDDEN DEATH OF V.O.C.M. REPORTER MITCH KEAN.

HE GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF KINGS COLLEGE JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND WAS REGARDED AS A BRIGHT UP-AND-COMING REPORTER. ON VOCM'S OPEN LINE THIS MORNING, THE HOST URGED FOR AN OPEN AND HONEST CONVERSATION AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU THAT YOU KNOW IS IN DISTRESS OR DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS YOU CAN CALL THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS LINE AT 1-888-737-4668. >> Carolyn: THE CITY OF ST. JOHN'S IS ONCE AGAIN HAVING ISSUES WITH PARKING METRES AND IT WILL BE INCONVENIENT FOR METRE USERS. THE METRES WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS AS OF AUGUST 28th. THAT'S BECAUSE THE COMPANY THAT SUPPLIES THE METRES IS UPDATING ITS RECEPTION FROM 2G TO 3G. THE MAYOR DANNY BREEN SAYS THAT THE CITY WILL NOT UPDATE THE METRES BECAUSE IT'S AN UNNECESSARY EXPENSE SINCE THE CITY IS IN THE PROCESS OF UPGRADING TO A NEW SYSTEM. BREEN SAYS THAT CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THE PAY-BY-PHONE APP. HE SAYS THAT ONCE THE NEW SYSTEM COMES ONLINE IT WILL OFFER THE RESIDENTS MANY MORE OPTIONS. >> WHENEVER THE CHANGES ARE MADE, IT HAS TO HAVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE. NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO WANT TO DOWNLOAD THE APP AND NOT EVERYONE WILL WANT TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MULTI--- MULTIPLE CHOICES FOR PEOPLE TO USE WHEN PARKING DOWNTOWN. >> Ariana: AN INVESTIGATION INTO SMUGGLING BETWEEN ST. PETER NICOLA AND THE PENINSULA HAS TURNED UP THIS -- OVER 760-OUNCE BOLGTDS OF CONTRABAND ALCOHOL. THEY SEIZED THE BOTTLES BETWEEN POINT MAY AND FORTUNE. POLICE SAY THAT THE LIQUOR IS SMUGGLED BY LOCALS WHO ARE KNOWN TO POLICE BUT NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED YET. >> Carolyn: A ROCKY HARBOUR MAN WHOSE HOUSE HAS BEEN FLOODED TWICE THIS YEAR BY A BACKED UP SEWER IS GETTING HELP FROM SOME GOOD SAMARITANS. JOHN GRANT'S NEIGHBOUR, AMY HANCOCK, HAS STARTED A GOFUNDME PAGE FOR HIM. SHE'S HOPING TO RAISE $6,000 TO ASSIST HANCOCK. GRANT SAYS THAT THEY WON'T COVER THE SEWAGE BACK-UPS AND THE TOWN SAYS THEY'RE WORKING TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO PREVENT THE CULVERTS FROM FILLING UP DURING HEAVY RAINS. >> Ariana: KAETLYN OSMOND WILL NOT COMPETE THIS WINTER. THE REIGNING WORLDING IT SKATING CHAMPION MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN A STATEMENT TODAY. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE 22-YEAR-OLD FROM MARYSTOWN SAID THAT SHE WOULD SIT OUT THE INTERNATIONAL SKATING UNION'S GRAND PRIX KIR KIT. -- CIRCUIT. SHE WON THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN MARCH IN ITALY. SHE CAPTURED BRONZE AT THE PYEONGCHANG OLYMPICS AND HELPED THE CANADIAN SQUAD TO EARN A GOLD MEDAL. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SKATERS TO TAKE TIME OFF AFTER THE OLYMPICS. PATRICK CHAN TOOK A YEAR OFF AFTER SOCHI. AND TESSA VIRTUE AND SCOTT MOIR ALSO STEPPED AWAY FOLLOWING THE GAMES IN RUSSIA. >> Carolyn: WELL, SOME PEOPLE IN KENMOUNT TERRACE WERE OUT TODAY REPLANTING TREES IN PART OF THE FOREST DESTROYED BY FIRE. LAST MONTH PARTS OF THE SUBDIVISION WERE EVACUATED BECAUSE OF A NEARBY FIRE THAT DAMAGED SEVERAL HOMES. BUT AS JEREMY EATON REPORTS THE AWFUL EVENT HAS BROUGHT THE COMMUNITY CLOSER TOGETHER. >> Reporter: KENMOUNT TERRACE RESIDENT VICTORIA BEARSBEARD IS ONE THAT CAME TO PLANT TREES TODAY. SHE KNOWS HOW LUCKY MANY IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE. >> IT'S MIRACULOUS THAT WE DIDN'T LOSE A SINGLE HOME THAT DAY. THERE'S BEEN DAMAGE TO THE CLOSER HOUSES BUT THE PEOPLE CAN GO HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND THAT'S HUGE. >> Reporter: LAST MONTH A FIRE THREATENED THE PEACEFUL SUBURB. >> A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE RUNNING HOUSE-TO-HOUSE HELPING PEOPLE GET THEIR PETS OUT OR GET SPRINKLERS AND USING THE HOSE ON THE BACK LAWN AND TRYING TO KEEP THINGS WET SO THE HOUSES WOULDN'T CATCH. THERE WAS A LOT OF COMMUNITY SPIRIT THAT DAY. YOU'VE GOT TO PULL TOGETHER IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT. >> PLANTS LIKE SPRUCE AND FIR... >> Reporter: TODAY SARAH CROCKER AND THREE MEMBERS MUCH THE GREEN TEAM WERE WADING THROUGH THE BURNED MESS OF FOREST PLANTING NEW LIFE. >> WE'RE HERE ON KIND OF THE EDGE OF THE FOREST FIRE. SO THE GROUND WAS NOT TOO BADLY BURNED. THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT OF SORT OF PEATY SOIL UNDERNEATH THEY THINK THAT THESE TREES WILL DO REALLY WELL WITH. >> Reporter: A GROUP THAT HAD DONE WORK ON A NEIGHBOURHOOD STREAMS PROJECT, AND TODAY'S PROJECT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, THANKS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY THEY'RE PLANTING MORE THAN 400 BALSAM FIR AND BLACK SPRUCE SEEDLINGS. >> WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH WORK TO KIND OF HELP WITH THE STORM DRAINS AND THE EDUCATION ABOUT POLLUTION IN OUR WATERWAYS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO MAINTAIN THOSE CONNECTIONS. AND TO HELP PEOPLE IN A NEW DEVELOPMENT HAVE LIKE A THRIVING AND HEALTHY NEIGHBOURHOOD TO LIVE IN. >> Reporter: IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS GIVEN BACK. EARLIER THIS MONTH IT HOSTED A BARBECUE FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS. A THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK THEY DID FIGHTING THIS FIRE. >> IT WAS REALLY SWEET. THEY WERE SO TOUCHED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF THING DONE FOR THEM. >> Reporter: THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WON'T BE THE LAST TREE PLANTING EFFORT HERE IN KENMOUNT TERRACE. THEY WOULD LIKE TO PLANT ANOTHER ONE IN THE FALL TO TRY TO TURN WHAT IS NOW BLACK BACK TO GREEN. JEREMY EATON, CBC NEWS, ST. JOHN'S. >> Carolyn: THERE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF DOWNTOWN BAR, THIS ST. JOHN'S BUSINESS SAY THEY CAN CURE CUSTOMERS' HEADACHES AND HANGOVERS, NO ALCOHOL NECESSARY. >> Ariana: BUT HOW HARD IS IT TO SELL FRESH AIR TO NEWFOUNDLANDERS? \"HERE & NOW'S\" KATIE BREEN SWUPG SWUNG BY THE OXYGEN BAR TO FIND OUT. >> HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE BAR ON 7 QUEEN STREET DOWNTOWN. YOU GET THE AIR THAT'S COMING IN, THE 21% OXYGEN FILLED AIR AND, IT COMES INTO THIS MACHINE WHICH HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF FILTERS IN IT. IT FILTERS OUT THE HYDROGEN AND THE NITROGEN AND THE CARBONS AND THE METHANE, EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE AIR AND PURIFIES THE OXYGEN TO 90% TO 92% PURITY. IT GOES THROUGH THE HOSES THAT THEN GO INTO THESE MACHINES HERE IT. BUBBLES INTO THESE SCENTED BOTTLES AND THEN UP INTO YOUR NOSTRILS THROUGH THESE STERILE SINGLE-USE CANULA. IT'S ENERGIZING. THE ANALOGY THAT I USED BEFORE, IT'S LIKE PUTTING A BETTER QUALITY GAS INTO A CAR. IT'S PUTTING BETTER QUALITY OXYGEN INTO YOUR BODY, INTEREST YOUR BLOODSTREAM -- INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM. SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT OF A HARD SELL BUT WHEN PEOPLE DO END UP GIVING IT A TRY THEY USUALLY ARE LIKE, OH, WOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT. A LOT OF THE TIME THEY DO BECOME RELIGIOUS USERS OF THE OXYGEN. >> SO RIGHT NOW I CAN SMELL MOUNTAIN BERRY AND PINEAPPLE COCONUT AND SO IT'S AROMATHERAPY THAT IS MIXED IN AS WELL. WHEN I DO IT I FEEL VERY ENERGIZED, FOR ONE. I FEEL THAT I HAVE BETTER COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND I FEEL THAT IT CARRIES WITH ME THROUGHOUT THE DAY. >> WHEN YOU GET THE GOOD FEELING THAT COMES FROM THE OXYGEN GOING THROUGH YOUR BODY IT KIND OF OVERRIDES ANY NEGATIVE FEELINGS OR ANY STRANGE FEELINGS OF HAVING TWO PIECES OF PLASTIC UP YOUR NOSTRILS. BUT THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW GOOD YOU CAN FEEL. SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY FEELING GOOD YOU WON'T MADE TO FEEL SUBLIME. JUST COME IN AND GIVE IT A TRY AND FOR A DOLLAR A MINUTE PLUS TAX, IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE OF A THING. THE WORST THING THAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT YOU WON'T FEEL ANY BETTER THAN BEFORE, AND YOU SURE AS HECK WON'T FEEL WORSE EITHER. A LOT OF PEOPLE GO OUT FEELING A LOT BETTER THAN THEY DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME. SO IT'S WORTH A SHOT. (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (\u266a\u266a\u266a) >> Carolyn: THERE ARE THINGS THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD RATHER FORGET BUT SOON THE PUBLIC WILL GET TO EXPERIENCE A SIDE OF THIS PROVINCE'S HISTORY AS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. >> Ariana: HER MAJESTY'S PENITENTIARY IS THE OLDEST RUNNING PRISON IN CANADA AND NOW THE EFFORTS OF ONE RETIRED CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IS SAVING THAT HISTORY. THAT STORY IS COMING UP. (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (\u266a\u266a\u266a) >> Ariana: WELCOME BACK TO \"HERE & NOW.\" WELL, WE ALL HAVE OUR COLLECTIONS, THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT THAT REPRESENT THE PAST, FAMILY PICTURES, MAYBE JEWELLERY. BUT FOR DAVID HARVEY HIS INTERESTS ARE DIFFERENT. HE'S COLLECTING HOMEMADE WEAPONS AND DEATH RECORDS. IT'S ALL IF AN EFFORT TO KEEP PRISON HISTORY PRESENT. >> THESE ARE ALL SHANKS THAT HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED OVER THE YEARS DOWN IN THE PRISON. FROM SOMETHING SO SMALL, A PIECE OF PLEXIGLAS LIKE THAT TO -- TO A TOOTHBRUSH HANDLE SHARPENED. >> Ariana: WHEN AN INMATE WHITTLED HIS TOOTHBRUSH INTO A WEAPON HE LIKELY NEVER EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD ONE DAY END UP ON DISPLAY. OR THAT AN ALTERNATIVE USE TO THE ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF CANADA WOULD BE CAREFULLY PACKED AWAY IN PROTECTIVE WRAP. >> TODAY IS A GOOD DAY, YES, MATTIE AND I ARE HERE TODAY AND WE'RE PACKING UP ALL OF OUR MATERIALS AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING EVERYTHING FROM HERE, FROM THE PRISON TO QUEENS COLLEGE WHERE IT WILL BE DOCUMENTED. AND EVENTUALLY IT WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THERE. >> Ariana: AN EXHIBIT ON H.M.P.'S HISTORY. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING FOR DAVID HARVEY. HE RETIRED AS A CAPTAIN AT H.M.P. IN 2014. BUT HE'S HARDLY PUT THE PRISON BEHIND HIM. HIS FASCINATION WITH CRIME AND PUNISHMENT HAS ONLY GROWN. IT STARTED HERE IN THE BASEMENT OF THE PRISON'S GYMNASIUM, WHAT LOOKED LIKE OLD USELESS BOOKS TURNED OUT TO HOLD INCREDIBLE PIECES OF THE PAST. WITH THE HELP OF INMATES AND OTHER CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS, HARVEY BEGAN TO COLLECT ITEMS THAT DOCUMENT THE PRISON'S HISTORY. IT CULMINATED IN THIS MAKESHIFT MUSEUM. AFTER YEARS OF PUSHING FOR THE DOCUMENTS TO BE PROTECTED, THE PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES STEPPED IN. >> SO THIS LEDGER IS ONE THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST DAMAGED. >> Ariana: THAT'S WHERE THE CONSERVER TO COMES IN. SHE STABILIZE THE PAPERS SO THEY COULD BE DIGITIZED AND PRESERVED. >> WHEN I WAS DOING THE WORK I REALISED THAT I HAD TO STOP READING SO MUCH AND GET ON WITH MY WORK. SO I WOULD JUST GO OVER AND, YEAH -- IT MADE FOR REALLY GOOD READING. >> Ariana: THE OLDEST DOCUMENTS DATE BACK TO 1838, LONG BEFORE H.M.P. IS WHERE IT IS TODAY. ITEMS SO OLD THAT SOME EMPLOYEES AT THE ROOMS STARTED TO GET SICK WHEN THEY BEGAN WORKING ON THE OLD LEDGERS. >> WE SAMPLED ON THE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE AND ON THE SPINES OF ALL OF THE MATERIAL THAT WE HAD. AND WHAT CAME UP WAS HIGH, REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF ARSENIC, AND COPPER. >> Ariana: WITH SOME DETECTIVE WORK SHE DISCOVERED THAT THOSE DEADLY ELEMENTS WERE USED IN PESTICIDES BACK WHEN THESE DOCUMENTS LIVED AT THE PRISON AND THE SUPREME COURT AND WHEN IT WAS ON SIGNAL HILL WITH. THAT OUT OF THE WAY SHE COULD FOCUS ON THIS WINDOW INTO THE PAST. >> THIS IS WHERE HE CERTIFIED THAT HE EXAMINED THE BODY OF AN INMATE WHO WAS EXECUTED ON THE GROUNDS OF THE PRISON. AND THEY SAID THAT HE WAS DEAD. SO THERE'S RECORDS OF SOME OF THE MORE HISTORIC EVENTS THAT WE KNOW OF. >> Ariana: AND IT WAS THIS DOCTORS BOOK THAT SPARKED INTEREST FROM MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY'S MADELEINE MINT. >> NOW I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO INDIVIDUALLY WRAP THESE GUYS IN BAGS. I HAVE BEEN DOING WORK WITH THE 19th CENTURY ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE HOSPITALS IN THE HOSPITAL. SO WHAT I KEPT SEEING WERE PATIENTS COMING INTO THE HOSPITAL FROM THE PENITENTIARY. >> Ariana: SHE FOUND SOMETHING BETTER, FUNDED BY A GRANT FROM MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY, THE ITEMS WILL BE ON DISPLAY IN THE FALL. FOR HARVEY A BITTERSWEET VICTORY. SO IS THIS IT FOR YOU, FOR TRYING TO COLLECT THESE PIECES OF HISTORY? >> OH, NO, NO, NO. I'LL ALWAYS BE HANDS ON. AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WE'LL FIND DOWN THERE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE AMAZED  AT. >> Carolyn: SHANKS AND ARSENIC AND EXECUTION. WOW. >> Ariana: DAVE HARVEY IS A COOL GUY AND HE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS EXHIBITION. IT WILL PROBABLY BE SOME TIME IN NOVEMBER SO YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY TUNED. BUT THE OTHER INTERESTING THING THAT I COULDN'T FIT IN THERE IS THAT THROUGH HIS RESEARCH HE'S FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S STILL TWO BODIES BURIED WHERE H.M.P. IS TODAY BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAD HANGINGS BACK THEN. THAT'S HOW OLD THE PRISON IS. >> Carolyn: WOW, THANK YOU, ARIANA. >> Reporter: A RARE APPEARANCE OF A CRUISE SHIP IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IN HAPPY VALLEY-GOOSE BAY LATER THIS WEEK. ONE BUSINESS OWNER IS OFFERING AN ICY INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND PICK UP TRASH. I'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (\u266a\u266a\u266a) >> Ariana: NOW BEFORE WE GET TO THE WEATHER WE WANT TO SHOW YOU A PHOTO OF A BIZARRE, GROSS PICTURE OF THE DAY ON THE NORTHEAST COAST OVER THE WEEKEND. >> Carolyn: YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS THREE FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S A CAPELIN INSIDE A COD FISH AND INSIDE A LARGER COD FISH. YES, LIKE RUSSIAN DOLLS. THIS IS WHAT MARK STURGE PULLED OUT OF THE WATER THIS WEEKEND AND HE'S PRETTY SURE THAT IT ONLY COUNTS AS ONE FISH IN HIS CATCH LIMIT. >> Ariana: THAT'S A GOOD GUESS. THEY DID COOK UP THE LARGER FISH, I WAS WONDERING THAT BUT NOT THE SMALLER ONE BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT IT WAS STARTING TO DIGEST THE LITTLE -- >> Carolyn: GROSS. >>> WELL, NOW IT'S TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE WEATHER FORECAST. IF YOU'RE IN THE EAST YOU HAVE PROBABLY NOTICED THE COOLER TEMPERATURES. WELL, THAT IS GOING TO TAKE A TURN TOMORROW. IT'S A RETURN TO THE HUMIDITY TOMORROW. SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK STARTING WITH THE HIGHS TODAY, IF I CAN GET THIS GOING. HERE WE ARE. THE HIGHS TODAY, WE'RE LOOKING AT 17\u00ba IN ST. JOHN'S. THAT'S ALL IT WAS TODAY. 26\u00ba IN BADGER. IT LOOKS LIKE THE HOTSPOT FOR TODAY. AND IN LABRADOR CITY, ALSO SITTING AT 17\u00ba TODAY. NOW WE DO HAVE SOME SHOWERS FOR THE AVALON OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. AND PARTS OF THE EAST AS WELL AS FOR LABRADOR. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS BAND OF SHOWERS THAT WILL PERSIST ACROSS LABRADOR OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. BRINGING LOTS OF SHOWERS TO THE COAST AND TO LAB WEST. SO LOOKING AT ABOUT 5 mm OF RAIN FOR LAB WEST. ABOUT 2-4 mm FOR NAIN AND 5 mm ALONG THE COAST. IN THE EAST WE'RE LOOKING AT 5 mm FOR THE ST. JOHN'S AREA AND THE AVALON PENINSULA. AND WE COULD SEE SHOWERS AS WELL IN CENTRAL AREAS, OVERNIGHT LOWS BETWEEN 14\u00ba AND 15\u00ba. LOOK AT THIS LOVELY PHOTO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ANN MADDIN FOR SENDING THIS IN. IT'S ORCHIDS FROM BUTTER POT PARK. I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS LOVELY AND I WANTED TO USE IT. THIS IS A LOOK AT THE EARLY MORNING TOMORROW WHEN YOU HEAD OUT YOUR DOOR IN THE ST. JOHN'S AREA, IT'S STILL RAINING A BIT IN THE MORNING, BUT THE TEMPERATURES ARE STARTING AT 17\u00ba ABOUT 6:30 TOMORROW MORNING. SO, YES, IT'S DEFINITELY NICE AND WARM AS YOU HEAD OUT. AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR CENTRAL AREAS AND THE TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 15\u00ba AND 16\u00ba. AND FOR LABRADOR, LOOKING AT A MIX OF SUN/CLOUD AND SOME SHOWERS FOR THE WEST TO START YOUR DAY. SO, YEAH, WEDNESDAY THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE COULD SEE SHOWERS IN THE MORNING FOR THE EAST BUT THAT'S GOING TO START TO CLEAR OFF AND SOME HEAVIER SHOWERS ARE COMING THROUGH FOR LABRADOR LATER IN THE DAY. SO IN THE EAST WE COULD SEE ABOUT 2 mm OF RAIN IN THE MORNING BUT THEN IT SHOULD CLEAR OFF TO A MIX OF SUN/CLOUD. AND CHECK OUT THE HUMIDEX, A HIGH OF 22\u00ba. BUT THE HUMIDEX IS 30\u00ba, SO IT'S FEELING WARMER TOMORROW THAN IT FELT TODAY. AS WE HEAD INTO CENTRAL, A HUMIDEX OF 27\u00ba THERE AND THE TEMPERATURE HIGHS ABOUT 22\u00ba THERE AS WELL. AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THE MORNING AS WELL. AND ON THE WEST COAST, MOSTLY A MIX OF SUN/CLOUD FOR EVERYONE AND A HUMIDEX OF 28\u00ba. SO IT'S GOING TO BE HUMID OVER THERE AS WELL AS ALONG THE STRAITS SOME CLOUDY SKIES FOR MARY'S HARBOUR AND SUN/CLOUD FOR ST. ANTHONY. AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR CARTWRIGHT BUT THE TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 20s THERE. SO NAIN WILL GET THE BULK OF THE SHOWERS TOMORROW. 5-10 mm OF RAIN THERE AND A TEMPERATURE OF JUST 9\u00ba. SO MUCH COOLER THERE. AND LABRADOR CITY LOOKING AT ANOTHER 5 mm OF RAIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE TEMPERATURE HIGH OF 17\u00ba. SO THAT'S YOUR FORECAST. ARIANA, BACK TO YOU. >> Ariana: THANKS, CAROLYN. >>> A HAPPY VALLEY-GOOSE BAY BUSINESS WANTS TO CLEAN UP THE TOWN ONE SCOOP AT A TIME. DEES LANDING, A LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE IS OFFERING FREE ICE CREAM TO ANYONE WHO GOES OUT AND CLEANS UP THE TOWN'S MAIN STRETCH. IT'S ALL IN PREPARATION FOR A CRUISE SHIP THAT WILL ARRIVE LATER THIS WEEK CARRYING MORE THAN 400 VISITORS. OUR JACOB BARKER GRABBED A GARBAGE BAG THIS AFTERNOON IN HOPES OF CASHING IN ON THIS SWEET DEAL. >> Reporter: HEY THERE. >> HOW'S IT GOING? YOU READY FOR YOUR FREE ICE CREAM? >> Reporter: I DEFINITELY AM. >> ALL RIGHT, PUT HER IN. ALL RIGHT. >> Reporter: ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S MY ICE CREAM? >> PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE CRUNCH. >> Reporter: THANK YOU. >> YOU'RE WELCOME, JACOB. >> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE STATE OF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD HERE? >> I THINK THAT IT'S DISCOURAGING. THERE ARE STILL A FEW OF US OUT THERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT CLEANED UP. SO IF WE SPREAD THAT ATTITUDE AROUND THEN HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY WILL KIND OF ADAPT TO LEARNING TO PICK IT UP AS THEY SEE IT AND NO MATTER IF IT'S IN THEIR DRIVEWAY OR ON A GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT. >> Reporter: SO I WAS OUT TODAY PICKING UP TRASH ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND I FOUND SOME PRETTY GROSS THINGS OUT THERE. >> I BET. HOPEFULLY WE CAN LEARN AND WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH MORE INITIATIVES TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY CLEAN. MAYBE ANOTHER BUSINESS WILL TAKE ON THE NEXT INITIATIVE. WHO KNOWS. HOPEFULLY SO. >> Reporter: WHY RIGHT NOW ARE YOU DOING THIS? >> ALL RIGHT, SO THERE'S A CRUISE SHIP COMING TO TOWN ON THURSDAY AND I'M PART OF THE WELCOMING COMMITTEE FOR THE SHIP. AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S A TRASH PROBLEM IN HAPPY VALLEY-GOOSE BAY. SO THERE WERE TALKS AROUND THE TABLE MANY TIMES WHAT WILL WE DO TO GET THIS PLACE CLEANED UP. SO I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA AND I WASN'T SURE HOW IT WAS GOING TO PLAY OUT BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALLY WANT PEOPLE TAKING FROM THEIR HOME, YOU KNOW, THE POINT IS TO GET IT OFF THE STREET. SO MY SISTER CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT, WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO BRING PHOTO EVIDENCE THAT YOU PICKED IT UP ON HAMILTON RIVER ROAD. >> Reporter: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOURIST COMING INTO TOWN BUT DO YOU THINK THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE THE REASON WHY WE CLEAN UP? >> DEFINITELY NOT. THIS IS JUST A VERY GOOD EXCUSE AT THIS POINT. MAYBE TO GET MORE THINGS GOING. AND I THINK THAT IT STARTS WITH US AS PEOPLE PERSONALLY. YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEE A SMALL BIT OF TRASH, PICK IT UP, PUT IT IN THE NEXT TRASH CAN. IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY. >> Reporter: AN ICE CREAM INCENTIVE HELPS TOO. >> WELL, EVERYBODY LOVES ICE CREAM. AND IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE JUST PART OF A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE. SO I THOUGHT THAT THE ICE CREAM WOULD KIND OF DRAW PEOPLE TOWARDS IT AND IT'S NEARING THE END OF THE SUMMER NOW AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD FAMILY ACTIVITY. TO GO OUT AND PICK UP A BAG OF TRASH EACH AND COME DOWN AND ENJOY AN ICE CREAM. >> Reporter: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPEAKING WITH US TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE ICE CREAM. >> THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BAG OF GARBAGE, JACOB. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >> Reporter: IT'S GOOD. >> Carolyn: HE DEFINITELY EARNED THAT ICE CREAM. >> Ariana: THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT BRIBE, INCENTIVE, AND GOOD NEWS FOR ANYONE IN HAPPY VALLEY-GOOSE BAY WHO WANTS TO GET IN ON THE FREE ICE CREAM, I WISH THAT WE COULD, BUT THE SHOP HAS EXTENDED THE DEAL TO ALL DAY TOMORROW. >> Carolyn: GOOD. >>> CITY CREWS HAVE DUG UP A BIT OF A MYSTERY IN QUIDI VIDI VILLAGE. A LARGE CONCRETE WALL WAS UNEARTHED WHILE MAKING ROOM TO BUILD A CUL-DE-SAC NEAR THE PLANTATION CENTRE. IT'S DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF MANY ONLOOKERS AND LOCALS AND TOURISTS ALIKE, ACCORDING TO A LOCAL ARCHAEOLOGIST, IT WAS SOMETHING THEY WERE EXPECTING TO FIND. >> THE FOUNDATIONAL REMAINS OF A GREENHOUSE THAT WAS HERE BY THE AMERICANS DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, I GUESS. >> Carolyn: IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED TO BE A HOUSE. AND IT WAS CALLED A GREENHOUSE BECAUSE IT SOUNDS BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE. (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (\u266a\u266a\u266a) >> Reporter: THE ISSUES THAT EXIST IN TORONTO ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE ISSUES THAT EXIST IN ST. JOHN'S. >> Ariana: OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS SEVERAL HOSPITALITY GROUPS HAVE CALLED FOR TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS FOR AIRBNB. NEXT WE TALK TO ONE AIRBNB OWNER WHO URGES THE GOVERNMENT TO CAREFULLY STUDY THE INDUSTRY. >> Carolyn: WELCOME BACK TO \"HERE & NOW.\" AS YOU HEARD EARLIER IN THE SHOW, ST. JOHN'S IS PRESSURING THE PROVINCE TO PUT TIGHTER REGULATIONS ON SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES. THE CITY SAYS THAT IT'S LOSING $300,000 EACH YEAR LARGELY DUE TO UNREGISTERED RENTALS LIKE AIRBNB. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AGREES. \"HERE & NOW'S\" ZACH GOUDIE SPOKE TO AN AIRBNB HOST FOR HIS PERSPECTIVE. >> SO I HAVE A SINGLE AIRBNB RENTAL AND IT'S A GUEST SUITE IN MY HOME AND I LIVE ABOVE AND I HAVE THE GUEST SUITE BELOW. IT WAS BUILT FOR MY PARENTS BUT IT'S NOT IN USE FOR A LOT OF THE TIME. >> Reporter: SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE TWO INDUSTRY GROUPS CALL FOR SEEM INNOCUOUS, REGISTERING AND HAVING HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS ADDRESSED ON-SITE. BUT THERE'S TWO BIG ISSUES TO PUT TO YOU. ONE IS THESE INDUSTRY GROUPS WANT TO HAVE A HARD CAP ON THE NUMBER OF NIGHTS PER YEAR THAT YOU CAN RENT A PROPERTY AS AN AIRBNB. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IDEA? >> I THINK THAT IT'S PROBLEMATIC, WITH THE FACT THAT AIRBNBs ARE LARGELY PEOPLE'S HOMES. SO WE'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW PEOPLE CAN USE THE SPACE THEY'VE ALREADY PURCHASED, THEIR SPARE BEDROOM IS AN EXAMPLE. MY PARENTS COME AND STAY WITH ME, IS THAT MY NIGHT UNDER A CAP AND THEN THEY BUY ME DINNER, DID WE HAVE A TRANSACTION? SO IT'S COMPLICATED WHEN YOU TRY TO REGULATE HOW PEOPLE USE THEIR SPACE. I THINK THAT A HARD CAP ON THAT IS PROBLEMATIC. >> Reporter: ANOTHER BIG ONE THAT HAS TEETH IS THE IDEA THEY WANT TO LIMIT THE RENTALS OF AIRBNB TO PRINCIPAL RESIDENTS ONLY. WHICH IS TO SAY THAT YOU CAN RENT A ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE BUT YOU CAN'T BUY A HOUSE DOWN THE ROAD AND RENT THAT OUT WHOLESALE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? >> IT TIES BACK TO THE HOUSING MARKET RIGHT NOW AND THE VACANCY RATE RIGHT NOW. IN ST. JOHN'S WE HAVE OVER A 7% VACANCY RATE. SO THAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN TORONTO WHICH IS .9% VACANCY RATE, AND WE HAVE A STRUGGLING HOUSING MARKET WHICH HAS A LOT OF SPINOFF AFFECTS LIKE A STRUCK STRUGGLING CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. SO ANYTHING THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO BUY UNITS IS VALUABLE AND WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW THE REGULATIONS WILL IMPACT THAT. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE WITH HOSTS WHO RENT A ROOM IN THEIR HOUSE AND THOSE WHO HAVE UNITS LEFT AND RIGHT. SO TO GET A LOCALIZED ASSESSMENT THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR. AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLATFORM AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOSTS. I HAVE BEEN SAY IT'S NOT A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL SOLUTION AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE ARE USING AIRBNB AND WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE HERE. YOU KNOW, HOSTS LIKE MYSELF VERSUS HOSTS WITH MORE UNITS. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS A FURTHER LOOK AND THIS NATIONAL STUDY DOESN'T DO ENOUGH. >> Reporter: FINALLY, DO YOU THINK THAT THE AIRBNB, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH AIRBNB BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS TO THE SERVICE THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, HAPPENING IN CITIES LIKE ST. JOHN'S THAT MAYBE ARE OVERLOOKED IN THESE STUDIES? >> WITHOUT A DOUBT AND THAT'S A MESSAGE THAT I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT MORE AND I WANT TO DELIVER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT STUDIES, NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, HOW PEOPLE INTERACT WITH AIRBNB, GENERALLY PEOPLE STAY LONGER, AS MUCH AS TWO TIMES AND SPEND MONEY, AS MUCH AS TWO TIMES AND I THINK THAT THE NUMBER IS 41% OF THE MONEY THEY SPEND IS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN WHICH THEY STAY. WHEN WE LOOK BEGAN AT DOWNTOWN ST. JOHN'S AS AN EXAMPLE AND YOU SEE THE SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSING LEFT AND RIGHT AND LOCAL PEOPLE STRUGGLING AND WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT IS PROPPING THAT UP, I JUST URGE GOVERNMENT TO CONSIDER WHAT THE IMPACT OF HEAVY-HANDED KNEE JERK REGULATIONS WITHOUT BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT TO OUR CITY COULD DO TO SMALL BUSINESS HERE. >> Reporter: IT'S A SERIES ISSUE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT ON IT. >> A PLEASURE TO CHAT WITH YOU, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> Ariana: IT APPEARS THAT AIR CANADA IS ONCE AGAIN TAKING AEROPLAN UNDER ITS WING. THE FREQUENT FLYER POINTS PROGRAMME USED TO BELONG TO THE AIRLINE UNTIL IT WAS SPUN OFF INTO AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS WHEN AIR CANADA TRIED TO BUY IT BACK LAST MONTH AND THE OFFER WAS REJECTED BUT TODAY A HIGHER PRICE WAS PROVISIONALLY ACCEPTED. AS SCOTT PETERSON REPORTS THAT SIGNALS SMOOTHER AIR AHEAD FOR FREQUENT FLYER POINT COLLECTORS. >> Reporter: AIR CANADA IS PROMISING A SEAMLESS TRANSITION FOR ANY AEROPLAN POINTS HOLDER OUT THERE AND SAYING THEY WILL NOT NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER WHEN IT COMES TO BUYING OR SAVING YOUR POINTS. IN A STATEMENT THE C.E.O.  CALINROBINECHAU SAID THEY CAN REDEEM WITH CONFIDENCE. AND THAT CONFIDENCE WORD IS TO ASSURE CANADIANS AND THE POINTS HOLDERS OUT THERE THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE THEIR POINTS BEING HONOURED. WE'RE SEEING THAT THIS IS BEING BACKED UP IN THE PRICE OF THIS DEAL. $450 MILLION IS THE PRICE TAG, PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF $1.9 BILLION IN DEBT. THAT'S THE LIABILITY OF ALL OF THOSE POINTS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACCUMULATED BY CANADIANS. NOW THIS IS A TOTAL OF  $2.35 BILLION. BECAUSE OF THAT PRICE TAG, AIR CANADA HAS A CONSORTIUM OF T.D. BANK AND CIBC AND VISA. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS DEAL HAS A CHANCE TO GO THROUGH AND IT'S SUBJECT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS' OPINIONS BUT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BOTH COMPANIES HAVE, IN FACT, APPROVED IT. AND THERE'S ALSO SOME QUESTION WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE DEALS THAT AIMIA HAS CUT AND THAT'S THE PARENT OF AEROPLAN WITH FLAIR AND WITH AIR TRANSAT AND WITH PORTER AND WHETHER THOSE DEALS WILL BE CUT. AIR CANADA IS NOT COMMENTING YET ON IF THE RELATIONSHIP WILL BE HONOUR THE. AND AIMIA IS SAYING IT'S UP TO THE CONSORTIUM SO ONE THING FOR SURE, THERE'S QUESTIONS WHETHER AIR CANADA WILL WANT TO HONOUR THAT AS THIS DEAL GOES THROUGH. SCOTT PETERSON, CBC NEWS, TORONTO. (\u266a\u266a\u266a) >> Ariana: THE SHALLWAY YOUTH CHOIR IS IN SOUTH AFRICA. JUST AHEAD SEE HOW ONE SH(\u266a\u266a\u266a) >> Ariana: WELL, IT'S BEEN A COOL LAST COUPLE DAYS, EVEN THE WINDOW HAS BEEN CLOSED, IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY BUT THAT WILL CHANGE? >> Carolyn: IT IS. AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE A RETURN TO WARMER TEMPERATURES. AND THE REST OF THE ISLAND HAS HAD WARMER TEMPERATURES, JUST US IN THE EAST HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING, HAVING IT A BIT COOL. SO WE HAVE SOME SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH TONIGHT IN THE EAST AND THROUGH LABRADOR, LOOKING AT ABOUT 5 mm OF RAIN FOR LABRADOR WEST. 2-4 IN THE NAIN AREA AND WE COULD SEE 5 mm OF RAIN FOR THE AVALON PENINSULA OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. THINGS SHOULD START TO CLEAR THOUGH IN THE DAY LOOKING AT A MAINLY SUN/CLOUD FOR THE ISLAND. AND JUST LOOK AT THESE SHOWERS COMING IN AND THIS IS A PRETTY HEAVY BAND OF RAIN COMING THROUGH FOR LAB WEST. WE'LL SEE THAT PLAY OUT IN JUST A MOMENT. SO THESE ARE YOUR TEMPERATURES FOR TOMORROW. YOU CAN SEE THE TEMPERATURE HIGHS AROUND 22\u00ba. 23\u00ba. BUT THE HUMIDEX IS WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT QUITE WARM. SO IN THE EAST WE'RE LOOKING AT A HUMIDEX OF 30\u00ba AND SO ALL OVER THE ISLAND IT'S GOING TO BE BETWEEN 27\u00ba AND 30\u00ba TOMORROW. SO WHILE THE TEMPERATURE HIGHS ARE AROUND 22\u00ba IT SHOULD FEEL WARMER THAN THAT. AND SOME MORNING SHOWERS FOR THE EAST BUT THAT SHOULD CLEAR OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY. NOW IN LABRADOR, NAIN IS GOING TO GET THE BULK OF THE SHOWERS TOMORROW. ABOUT 5-10 mm OF RAIN THERE AND COOLER TEMPERATURES AS WELL. 5 mm OF RAIN FOR LAB WEST. SO WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY IS WHEN LABRADOR IS GOING TO SEE MOST OF THAT RAIN AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT COULD GET PRETTY HEAVY. NOW THE ISLAND IS LOOKING AT SOME RAIN AS WELL, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS LABRADOR. SO FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY AND INTO THURSDAY, IT COULD BE ABOUT 15-25 mm OF RAIN FOR WESTERN LABRADOR. THE TEMPERATURES AROUND 18\u00ba. AND PERIODS OF RAIN FOR EASTERN LABRADOR. AND ON THE ISLAND IN THE EAST LOOKING AT SOME AFTERNOON SHOWERS THERE. 25\u00ba. SO YOU CAN SEE THE TEMPERATURES ARE REALLY BUMPING UP TO THE MID 20s ONCE AGAIN. SO THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. SO WE'RE HEADING INTO THURSDAY EVENING AND INTO FRIDAY. WE ARE SEEING SOME MORE SHOWERS IN THE EAST. STARTING TO CLEAR A LITTLE BIT IN LABRADOR, BUT SOME SHOWERS IN THE WESTERN AREAS THERE. BUT FRIDAY MORNING WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME HEAVIER SHOWERS COMING THROUGH, PARTICULARLY YOU CAN SEE ON THE AVALON PENINSULA THIS IS 11:00 ON FRIDAY MORNING, SO, YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME MORNING, AFTERNOON SHOWERS. 24\u00ba. SO WE'RE STILL IN THE MID 20s ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON. A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR CENTRAL AND 25\u00ba IS THE HIGH THERE. AND SUN/CLOUD IN THE WEST AS WELL. SO A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AS WELL FOR WESTERN LABRADOR. SO HERE IS THE LONG-RANGE, THE NEXT FIVE DAYS. SATURDAY/SUNDAY FOR THE EAST, LOOKING PRETTY GOOD AND THE TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 20s WITH A MIX OF SUN/CLOUD. AND A SIMILAR STORY FOR CENTRAL BUT THE TEMPERATURES ARE A LITTLE BIT WARMER FOR THE WEEKEND. AND WESTERN NEWFOUNDLAND LOOKING GREAT FOR FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. FOR EASTERN LABRADOR, A CHANCE OF SHOWERS A LOT OF SCATTERED SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE WEEK THERE. AND FOR WESTERN LABRADOR, THOSE SHOWERS CONTINUE AS WELL. AND THE TEMPERATURES JUST HOVERING BELOW THE 20\u00ba MARK. ARIANA? >> Ariana: WELL, THE SHALLAWAY YOUTH CHOIR IS ON A TRIP TO SOUTH AFRICA AT THE MOMENT. A COUPLE DAYS AGO THEY PERFORMED FOR SCHOOLCHILDREN IN SOWEKO, A TOWN MAKING UP JOHANNESBURG. BUT THEY HAD THE AUDIENCE JOIN IN WHAT BECAME A GROUP PERFORMANCE. JUST TAKE A LOOK... (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (singing). (\u266a\u266a\u266a) (\u266a\u266a\u266a) THAT'S A NICE VIDEO. >>> WELL, A MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA IS GIVING SPORTS FANS SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS, THE CANADIANS HAVE BEATEN THEIR RIVAL MEXICAN TEAM TO ADVANCE IN THE PRESTIGIOUS LITTLE LEAGUE SERIES. DEVON HEROUX HAS THE REPORT FROM WILLIAMSPORT, PENNSYLVANIA. >> Reporter: THIS PLACE WAS ELECTRIC LAST NIGHT. WHAT A SCENE. REDEMPTION ON THE MIND OF THE YOUNG CANADIANS AS THEY TOOK TO THE FIELD. BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT I WAS TRAVELLING AROUND THIS BASEBALL COMPLEX YESTERDAY AND NOT MANY PEOPLE WERE GIVING THE YOUNG B.C. BOYS A CHANCE AGAINST THE MIGHTY MEXICANS. BUT THEY MOUNTED A 6-1 LEAD AND THEN 6-4. THE BOTTOM OF THE SIXTH INNING, THE FINAL INNING, AND THE BASES LOADED, TWO OUT. WHEN A MEXICAN LINE DRIVE RIGHT TO THE PITCHER NATE COLINA AND HE CAUGHT IT AND HUNG ON THAT BALL. HERE'S A CUTE STORY, NATE CO LISTEN NA AFTER THE GAME, HEATHER, TELLING ME THAT ALL HE COULD THINK ABOUT WHEN THAT BALL WAS SCREAMING TOWARDS HIM IS, DON'T DROP THE BALL! HE DIDN'T DROP THE BALL, CANADA WINNING THIS THRILLING GAME HERE AND YOU SHOWED THE PICTURES OF THE PROUD PARENTS. THIS IS THE MAGIC OF LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES HERE IN WILLIAMSPORT. YOU HAVE PROUD PARENTS. YOU HAVE THESE 10, 11, 12, 13-YEAR-OLD KIDS PLAYING ON THE FIELD OF DREAMS. AND THIS WHALLEY, BRITISH COLUMBIA, TEAM, THEIR MAGICAL RUN CONTINUES HERE. WE ASKED THEM HOW ARE THEY GOING TO CELEBRATE? AND ALL OF THE KID YELLED AT ME, WE'RE HAVING PIZZA. BECAUSE ON SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN THEY WON A MARATHON THRILLER THEY HAD PIZZA. SO STICK WITH WHAT'S WORKING, EAT THAT PIZZA, GET READY FOR ANOTHER BASEBALL GAME. JUST UP THE HILL FROM VOLUNTEER STADIUM IS THE HISTORIC PARK. WHAT A SETTING THAT IS. YES, THEY GO TO THE BIG PARK, THEY TAKE ON PUERTO RICO. AND FOR PUERTO RICO THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A BASEBALL GAME. I'M LEARNING THAT THIS TEAM WAS IN THE THROES OF THE HURRICANE LAST FALL IN PUERTO RICO. THEY USED BASEBALL TO KEEP IT POSITIVE. NOW THEY TAKE ON THE CANADIANS 3:00 p.m. EASTERN TIME, FIRST PITCH SHOULD BE DRAMATIC YET AGAIN ON THE FIELD OF DREAMS. >> Ariana: THAT'S CBC'S DEVON HEROUX TAKING A BREAK FROM CURLING TO REPORT FROM THE LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES. >> Carolyn: WELL, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER PERSONAL ATTORNEY HAS PLED GUILTY TO EIGHT CHARGES AS PART OF A PLEA DEAL. MICHAEL COHEN APPEARED IN A FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK THIS AFTERNOON. THE CHARGES RELATE TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE FRAUD AS WELL AS BANK FRAUD AND INCOME TAX EVASION. THE DEAL COULD HAVE DRAMATIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENT. PROSECUTORS WERE LOOKING INTO A $130,000 HUSH MONEY PAYMENT. COHEN FACILITATED FOR ADULT ACTRESS STORMY DANIELS JUST A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND WHETHER THAT CONSTITUTED A CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION. AS PART OF HIS PLEA AGREEMENT, COHEN COULD BE SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON. >> Ariana: AND PAUL MANAFORT HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON EIGHT OF 18 CHARGES. BUT THE U.S. JURY DELIBERATING IN THE FINANCIAL FRAUD TRIAL OF FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN WAS DEADLOCKED ON THE REMAINING 10 CHARGES.

kids at home or work with kids or have grandkids or anything like that Santa bring me a dinosaur this was written by John Williamson and it's got three chords and it's C F and G oh you have more to love about this so it's just very beginner very basic song which has lyrics that are just so totally charming let's go over this drum for this it's going to be an island or Calypso strum that we're going to do if you want to do something a little bit snazzier replace that second down the Chuck don't know how to Chuck not a problem first of all I will link up here to how to do it Chuck and then you can just do it I'll instruct no problem I'm gonna change up the strum just a little bit within the song there's always these places where then bring me a dinosaur like those lyrics to really bring you out so I changed the strum there to two strums on G and a single strums Z so that lyrics really take the highlight not the strumming nothing ukulele so let's do a little practice on that we are going to do two islands drums laundry [Music] and then she /c / that's those are single strums so let's do that let's keep it nice and slow here now let's let's up our game let's just do the two island strokes on the Qi and then let's add the lyrics and I'll put them down here and that happens in the first and then it happens twice in the chorus just a quick peak here at the chord chart that I offer I've got links down below to get you there shows you the island strum with a Chuck but again you can put a simple down strum they're just regular Island strum we have an introduction and each one of these brackets here represents one island strum the verse as I talked about before you've got single strum G G C C and it's written like that and then what I offer at the ending to get out of this is do the chorus twice and you just slow down at the end so you're just going then bring me your deines keep it nice and simple easy peasy I have a box diagram here and what is helpful in that is it shows you for example if you're looking at the course and you look over here to where the course is written out you just say the C here and then the lyrics all tells you that you've got to play to Island strums to get through all of that and then again two F's on the island strum it also shows you that the verse and the chorus are all almost identical the only difference is how we get out of the course with the 2g single strums and to see Joomla strums and of course there's always diagrams how to do those chords argue with me so far good because I would love for you to subscribe to this

how do we decide between these two cute faces oh my goodness which puppy is the best puppy for us how do we figure out which one will best fit into our lifestyle well there's some interesting things that we can talk about on how to choose your puppy particularly if depending upon the breed you might want to pick your puppy according to color so for instance if you're doing doodles you may want a party doodle versus a brown doodle or a white doodle they come in such a vast variety of colors till sometimes color is really what you go to pick your puppy for but if you pick a breed like golden retriever well shoot they all kind of look alike don't they they're very similar in color so how do we determine which puppy is the puppy for us in any particular litter besides color well of course we want to look at sex so we have a boy on this side and a girl on this side so if we're very particular about the sex that we want a lot of times i will ask the breeder which particular sex do you feel in your bloodline is more attentive to their people that's a good question to ask your breeder your breeder is always the person of interest that you need to follow and listen to their advice they have spent a lot of time with these puppies you when you show up you have a very small window of opportunity to decide which puppy is going to be the right puppy for you but whereas these breeders have spent weeks and weeks and weeks with these puppies so they might know that for instance this puppy here might be an olympic athlete whereas this puppy here might be a couch potato and depending on your lifestyle one puppy will fit better with your particular lifestyle we also want to look at things like the mom and the parents come here skye skye come on in come on good girl sit down what a good girl we want to make sure that the color and the coat and the temperament of our mom and our dad are exactly what we're looking for in a puppy that we want long-term in our household because for instance if you have a very active lifestyle and your mom and your dad are very subdued dogs then you're going to struggle probably with that dog getting him up and getting him able to do things with you but for instance if we're looking at a dog-like building retriever we want a dog that is very obedient we want one that is very good nature dog because golden retriever is going to be ambassador for your home it's a dog that is going to put you in a place where neighbor kids are going to interact with your dog so you want to make sure that the temperament is correct on the parental dog's first fall if nothing else then we also want to look at each individual puppy what are the characteristics that we're looking for for instance golden retriever is block-headed dog so we really are kind of looking for a sharp-headed dog snub nose um we want to look for healthy ears healthy eyes so the puppy that we decide to look at we're going to go ahead and look the puppy over and make sure that all things are correct make sure there's no umbilical hernia on the bottom of the dog which is where their umbilical cord was actually attached then there's no poochiness we're also going to be looking at the puppy that is best on this back or that we can manipulate that doesn't have high freight or flight reflexes the breeder though of course can tell you the overall of this puppy in the last couple weeks of life we can definitely tell which particular dog is best suited for us by listening to the breeder and explaining to them the attributes that we're looking for in a puppy for sure so one of the things that you can test is pain tolerance if you have children in the household you want a dog with a very high pain tolerance because they might get their tail stepped on or their foot stepped on and you want to make sure that they're not reflexing back so when you take the puppy's pawn just squeeze slightly to see if the puppy removes its paw from you that tells you if the pain tolerance is high in the puppy if they remove their pile really quickly then that is a puppy that you probably want to uh look for a different pumpkin and literally if you have own children another thing that we are going to be looking at as well is how they interact with each other we want to make sure that your puppy is not a dominant or a submissive dog as well very middle of the road is the best dog for family pet so we're going to look at the puppies interacting with each other and they're a little bit young right now so they are just now beginning to interact with each other so when we get up to the seven or eight week marker i always suggest that you visit several times listen to the breeder's suggestion and definitely see which puppy is best mated for what you're looking for in your particular household so a lot of breeders do things called puppy culture biosensor work law hard testing depending on what type of breeder your breeder is and through these testing courses that the breeder does it actually tells the breeder what type of puppy you're looking for um it tells them what kind of dogs are in the litter for instance is this one an olympic athlete if it is is that one a couch potato those are things that are told between the testing and the puppy culture to the breeder that the breeder can definitely ascertain for you and give you good information the breeder is going to want to make sure to help you place the best puppy in their litter with your particular situation the reason being is because a good breeder is also understanding that this particular puppy is a billboard for their business and if they don't make the right connection with a puppy and the client then it's not going to be a good fit and the puppy's going to end up coming back or not living a great life and a good breeder always wants to make sure that their puppy is going to the best suited situation they can and if you have a breeder that is not concerned about that kind of situation honestly i would really recommend that you might look for another breeder as well but as we can tell these puppies are very well socialized they don't have any flight they're able to lay on their backs they don't give any issue for that they don't try to fight or move away from that which means the dog's very compliant which means this dog is going to train out very easy as well so not only are they cute oh my gosh you're so stinking cute but they are also going to be puppies that are well acclimated for going home the very first time and being able to be a good situational fit for our household so that is something that is very important i cannot stress that enough listen to the breeder look for a breeder that does some puppy culture or puppy testing so they can tell you the best attributes of that particular litter um when you go to pick your puppy up be sure that you have all the items necessary which is in another video that we have here on the doghood so be sure and look out for those videos as well and as we go forward we're going to teach you so much more about your new puppy i'm so excited for our new puppy purchase so in a requirement so i hope to see you

you uh you and i have talked here for the last i don't know maybe six months or so ish about a couple different things um we have started incorporating the cato outdoors boards into our personal training program and they rock so congratulations on you know i mean i think the concept of place training has been there and um but you really gave us a tool to utilize that in a no brainer very efficient way yeah that's i mean it's what i tell people like it's not it's not like i invented anything it's not rocket science it's a there were a lot of people doing place training for the last 20 or 30 years and they used a lot of different homemade contraptions to do it and i just saw so many people starting to adopt that type of training with no no good commercially made product and i thought well i can't believe nobody built doesn't design something and nobody did so finally i did it's been it been great because the hunting dog market has been really receptive to it um but outside of that it turns out almost like every sort of dog discipline out there uses platforms for training so it's it's being used like the military and police departments and agility trainers and obedience and fitness and um just a simple tool but a lot of people are are using it so it's really exciting and when i was in college um so a long long time ago i actually took my puppy and irish setter at that time through a local obedience class and um it was robin mcfarlane and that's my dog oh okay yeah i know robin right right i think yeah you said that like you guys kind of um okay because she she taught me you know with the puppy training she used that place concept as a um a foundation right away and um so that was that's kind of a neat little link that you have as well with robin yeah yeah did you bounce some ideas off of her for that um i so when i actually did go and meet with robin because she lives my parents are down in iowa i'm up in wisconsin she's kind of in the middle so one time on the way down to see my parents i stopped by and i had a prototype that i'd had 3d printed that i showed to her and it bounced some things off of her got her input made a few little changes based on her input and uh yeah so she was a little bit involved in the design for sure cool it's a small world it is isn't it yeah um but also in in the spaniel so how long have you had the english cocker spaniels so it seems like i've had them my entire life but my oldest spaniel is also my first spaniel and she is uh she turns 13 this summer so she's like 12 and a half right now okay you've since like won what several different field championships um yeah so i mean i i like i'm just the guy that likes dogs and has put a lot of time into them but i've had a few good ones in that time so and i put i mean it's a long story but i have i went through a lot of dogs looking for what i wanted probably to make up for my bad training i don't know but i learned a lot about training by having different dogs and different personalities and i i had a a pro trainer tell me a long time ago probably 10 years ago i guess that's a long time for me it's all relative right but about 10 years ago trainers said you've got to train about 50 dogs before you can really call yourself a pro like before you really know what you're doing and i i took that to heart and i've i have gone past the 50 dog mark probably a couple of years ago but um i i just you know i got that first cocker and i really liked her and then i got another one and i liked him even more and then i made a little drive a couple hours from home and came back with three more cockers and uh it was like a disease they just started to accumulate and my my wife just put up with it i have no idea why because looking back like that was it was crazy because it i was in way over my head i mean i had i didn't know what i was doing i had too many dogs but i put a lot of effort into it and i ended up i started field trialing in the fall of 2014 and i i hunted a lot before then and i still hunt a lot now but i i added on to trialing in that that fall 2014 and then went to a nationals or the nationals in michigan the next fall and i took third with a dog named breeze that i still have and then a couple of years later i won the amateur nationals with brees and then that fall of 2018 i won the open nationals with cato so and then i've had a few others along the way that have done done some things as well so a lot of it just it's good dogs and you know put it's it's time and having the dogs like that's really what it comes down to kind of what sparked my really interest in having a conversation with you is a couple days ago um well you know i've i've been very in a lot of listeners know i'm really interested in adding um a small dog to my team having a little flusher um for the area that we live in would be really ideal and i've gone between the boykins and the cockers and i mean can you kind of give me a little bit of an is it possible for you to give me an unbiased opinion of going between those two i mean i'm really familiar with boykins and i own like 10 cockers so that i mean it's probably not going to be possible to be unbiased but uh the the boykin the boycott has some cocker in it they used it when they were developing the breed um and i i think if you if your primary focus is a retrieving dog i think the boykin could um be i i don't even want to use like adjectives for this but i think the boycott would be good for that i've had i had one boyfriend in here for training that i really liked he was a he's a really enthusiastic retriever he's a little bit harder headed than most of the cockers maybe not all of them um the cockers generally are going to be flashier in the field like if you're using them for upland hunting a good talker is that a boy can a good boykin is not going to be able to keep up with a good talker in the uplands and i mean there's gonna i know there's gonna be listeners that i i'm not i'm definitely not trying to step on any toes and i know there's some really really good boykins but um the cockers i would say were more developed for upland hunting and that was their primary thing finding flushing and retrieving and the boykins were more developed for retrieving you know they they're almost like uh in some ways like a miniature retriever right like a labrador they're not really but retrieving was a big part of the boykins development and even now like in their in the trials that they have they really focus on retrieving although they do have an upland portion as well so um i i don't know i mean it's i know you got all types of listeners and i sure don't want to step on toes because i think they're both real nice dogs but yeah i know to me i really like the cockers yeah and what about i mean what's your input as far as water work between the two breeds is one going to be more water loving than the other or if i want to do some duck hunting so i don't think that you'll find really any difference as far as water enthusiasm i mean there's i've come across a few cockers that maybe don't love the water but i think some of that was development or environment and then i've had others that just they're like little muskrats they see water and they just go and swim right and and regardless of the temperatures sometimes they'll do that but i do think from from what i've heard and this is this is really only hearsay because i even the boykin that i had in for training it wasn't in the winter time but my understanding is that the boykins are a little bit better suited for cold water duck hunting so i i think that they have the leg up in that but i i'm not an expert on both breeds i mean the closest thing i'm an expert to is on the talkers okay so no i i definitely don't want to paint the boykins in an unfair light since i no i think that yeah no i think they have enough hype in the breed right now that they're doing just fine without taking offense to it no i just want to be careful that because i did nothing against them at all so i don't want people thinking oh yeah no it's like ask somebody asking me would you rather have a short hair or a wire hair you know i just think right there's there's positives to all the different breeds it's just kind of needs to be narrowed down to what you specifically are looking to get out of it and do it and and for 99 of the people out there you're not going to change their mind like if they like boykins they're going to like boykins no matter what anybody says and if you like talkers they're probably gonna like cockers no matter what anybody says right right just like pointers and setters right yes exactly yes um so in the in the pointing dog world um we have kind of a different means of setting i don't know if you want to say foundations and such but in our conversation the other day um when i was talking to you about uh touching in and getting another um or touching in again about getting a cocker puppy this year you had asked what my what i was looking at for timing and i said well i would like it to be around six months old by the time uh rough grouse season starts here which is september so i'm like yeah i guess born in march would be ideal that you know give or take a little bit uh a month for flexibility um and so for pointing dogs for us that's what we like to do you know at six months old we like to get them out there get them that experience get them into birds and then later on you know when season's over then we start going into the foundations and the obedience and such because for pointing dogs a lot of them get taught by the wild birds right so um and you had advised me against that and saying it would be more ideal to wait until a cocker is a year two and a year a half year old before i take it hunting and i i kind of stopped you in the conversation there and i said okay nope we need to get this we need to read we need to record this because i don't know and it's different from anything i know so i want my listeners to be able to catch in on it too so so dive in jordan tell us what that's about okay yeah so i get pretty passionate about this so you'll have to like cut me off and interject if you want more but i'll just once i get on a roll with this it's hard okay so there's the the adage that everybody knows is it takes birds to make a bird dog right and and i mean i hear that i used to hear it all the time maybe not quite as much now but that definitely is really prevalent within the honey dog community takes birds to make bird a bird dog and in in my opinion that is that adage has ruined so many flushing dogs maybe 20 dogs too i don't know but flushing dogs for sure because when you think about what a pointing dog is supposed to do it's supposed to hunt within range it's supposed to find birds flush them and retrieve them back to hand right like that's the duck hunt waterfall hunting that would be different but in the context of upland hunting that's all we're looking for hunt within range find birds flush them and retrieve them back to hand and there might be we might ask for more things depending on what level we're training to like we may ask them to be steady to the flush we may ask them to honor other dogs we may ask for a like a cleaner retrieve back to hand but at its core find flush and retrieve and find within gun range and i i can think back to some i'm 38 years old now and when i was a kid i spent hunted almost every day in iowa which is where i grew up and i had a lab my brother had a lab my dad had a golden retriever we had friends that had a couple of springers it was all flushing dogs literally in like a decade of pheasant hunting in iowa i never hunted over a pointy dog it was all flushers and i have so many memories of dogs out of control like just out of control maybe in control till the first bird flew and then after that whistling and yelling and walking fast maybe even running trying to keep up with the dog trying to keep it within range like trying to like pretty like stressful and hectic and like i remember like flat out being angry at my dog sometimes because he was such a knucklehead because he just he would get on a bird and just go or maybe he wasn't even on a bird maybe he would just go because he wanted to find a bird and it had nothing to do with hunting within range it had nothing to do with hunting with me it was just he was all about finding birds that lab that i had and ironically enough his name was kato that was my first dog and then i reused the name later on but that's neither here nor there but that was that was my like upbringing with flushing dogs chaos when when i was introduced to the spaniels and then i ran across a couple people who feel child and i started to formulate different opinions i started to realize more and more that with a flushing dog it really is more of a discipline of obedience than it is anything else so like a pointing dog maybe and it really just depends on region too so if you're out west maybe that planting dog is three four five six hundred yards away from you if you're in the grouse woods it's maybe 100 yards or 70 yards away from you so it kind of depends on region but with the pointing dog you're really looking for a lot of bird sense like go out run objectives find birds you know do whatever you got to do to find birds and then i'll come and flush it for you right and and so i could see with the pointers where getting them lots of bird exposure giving them that bird sense so they know how to really run the objectives in a big area would be super important important but with the spaniel i really don't want them more than 20 to 30 yards away from me at any point so there's going to be like micro objectives we could call them inside of that 20 to 30 yards and i do i for sure some spaniels are way better at hunting those micro objectives and and producing birds within that say 40 yard swath that you're taking with that dog there's some that are much better than others but but it's not the same as running 600 yards away and finding a bird it's cover this 40-yard swath hunt the objectives within that swath and and find birds for me well if you can't hunt there's there's not a lot of margin for air so a pointy dog if it's running 400 yards away or 600 yards away and i don't know how far your dogs run maybe that's farther or less but we'll just we'll just throw it out there say 40. i like them closer but yeah they can they can be out there in the open country on the prairies right and even if we say 50 yards or 100 yards there's that's still a 50 yard difference but that doesn't really matter too much with a pointing dog but with a flusher your margin of error is really small like if it fluctuates by 50 yards that means your dog is 20 yards or 70 yards away from you and that doesn't work right so so really like there's not a lot of margins for air with that dog getting too far away from you like really it needs to be within gun range all the time and gun range for most people is really they need to be shooting that bird within 45 maybe 50 yards for most people so that dog really needs to be within 25 yards if it's producing the bird off its nose so so the obedience becomes really really important if you can't keep that dog in range it's going to lead to a frustrating hunt and there's i guarantee you you have a lot of listeners with flushing dogs who had some really frustrating experiences watching their flushing dog go down the field putting up birds whether it's at a game farm or with wild birds the dog's out of range putting up birds and and the handler is just kind of along for a walk because none of the birds are being put up in range so as i say i know plenty with pointing bricks and had the same frustration so yeah but then but that's a different like that dog needs to be to learn how to to actually hold birds right right right the flusher just needs to learn to don't go out there and flush it that far away just just wait till we get there you know you still get you so so when i when i develop these dogs one i'm i'm looking i mean i'm gonna get a breeding that's proven you know i'm not going buying something from the pound and hoping that it likes birds and nothing against dogs from the pound at all that's just not what i do but i'm buying a dog that i know i know that pedigree i know the parents for sure i probably know back three or four generations and i know those dogs were natural bird dogs so i'm not really worried like i have a couple my daughter and i have three puppies here right now that are maybe 12 or 13 weeks old right now and i i am not worried at all about will they like birds will they retrieve birds will they have good noses will they be able to find birds like that's that will that's there and when we when we want to open up that can we'll open up that can but but before we get there what i really want is for those dogs to be focused on me i want to be like the center of their life you know i want them to like love me have a really good recall have a really good sit um i i don't want them out there just learning on their own and figuring out birds without me in the picture i want them to like find those birds with me and and be working with me so so my training really is geared toward that for that first you know and i i think when we had our short conversation i said better to wait till they're like a year or year and a half old before you hunt them but the the reality is it's not necessarily an age as much as it is a stage in the development so i'm not gonna let my dogs retrieve a bird until i know they'll come when i call them because the last thing i want is for let's say a four or five month old puppy to go out and retrieve a bird and let's just say this is just in training maybe i throw a dead pigeon out there or a cliffling pigeon and the puppy runs out and grabs it and the puppy looks at me because i'm calling it and then it looks off in the distance and says huh if i head that way maybe i can eat this thing before he catches me and because i've seen this happen right the puppy grabs the bird and says shoot i don't want to give this thing up like this is this is lunch like the best lunch i've ever had right why would i go give it to that guy and the puppy takes off and then now all of a sudden like let's say it was with a clipboard pigeon well now the puppy starts pulling feathers out of it and it's like it just leads to a bad experience so when i give a puppy a bird for the first time i want to have a really a pretty good idea that that dog has a good enough recall built into it that when i call it it's going to come to me with the bird and it's not going to take off running because i want i want that first experience with the bird to be positive i don't want to be chasing it around trying to catch it yanking the bird out of its mouth none of that so so that that development is let's make sure we have a good recall let's make sure it sits let's make sure it understands the whistle and then let's start to put it into more of a sterile environment almost a more controlled environment is with hunting i mean you so you hunt a lot you know this it gets it's not sterile like things happen like bird flies up over here and now a bird flies up over there and the dog goes out on a retrieve and another bird flies up and it can get chaotic really quickly when we're hunting which is great i mean that's what makes hunting fun right but if you if you have a puppy that already isn't very well trained and then stuff like that starts to happen all of a sudden that puppy is chasing birds all over the place and you see that the eyes kind of start to roll back in the head because it's so excited and it's like they go crazy right because it's like it's like crack cocaine to them i mean it's like they become addicted to it and they lose their minds and they just want more of it and all of a sudden you've got yeah everything goes out the door so i try to avoid that as much as possible because i'm i really and this is why i tell clients when i find coming here for training like let's we we always want to play from a position where we can win we don't want to play from a position where we're likely going to lose so there's a great chance if i go out hunting with a with a dog that's poorly trained at best that i'm going to lose and i i would i would rather like break it down into steps so i can win each step along the way and never have to like play from a position of losing if that makes sense it it does it's just like this is so it's the spaniels are very i would say uh role reversal from the pointers in that respective training because um you know in the pointing breeds we don't even have to if you're looking at for testing purposes um you we don't work on that retrieve we don't need a retrieve until they're a mature you know usually one and a half two year old dog and okay so and like i even listened to a podcast last week where a very well-known trainer um field trial horseback trainer was saying it's like don't teach your dog any obedience until it's two years old because you want it to be very independent you want it to stay out there and not want to come in and lock eyes with you and you know so that's it's a it's a totally different game um so but it's interesting because we've been doing like with our puppies once they turn eight weeks old they're they're working on obedience right away they're structured they know that the cato board we're doing like retrieving courses right now and these puppies i say puppies i mean they're like six to nine months old but they are the most comfortable in this retrieving drill that we're doing with all these different dogs because their base is starting on that cato board and and they're they're just transitioning really well they're comfortable up there they know i get rewards here i do good things here and um you know versus the ones that like my broncos two and a half years old i never really spent much time doing that place training with him and he's he gets up there and he's more nervous like where do you want me where should i go now and he's really questioning himself that yeah you know versus that six month old puppy that's like i'm right here let's do it let's work let's go i'm ready yeah yep it's interesting but uh go ahead i just get it maybe the pointing game will evolve a little bit and like a game but like maybe that that type of training because i know i mean guys have used barrels and things like that i don't think there's been a lot of platform training with pointy dogs in the past and i i think that's probably gonna evolve a little bit right but but that's yeah i don't i can definitely see the contrast because the pointers it is like let's let's let them go let's let them go and the spaniels i don't know how i don't know how much you've hunted behind flushers but not much it's not fun to hunt but it's not fun to hunt behind a flusher that's running wild and once they start running wild it's much much harder to reel them in than it is to like let's say take a dog that's six months old or eight months or ten months old and maybe it doesn't quite know how to get out and hunt yet but it really loves you and it wants to be with you like we can open up a dog like that real quickly if you need to okay but but the ones that are out of control when you start trying to reel them it's so much harder to reel them in right and and it starts more pressure and you know it's it's not a fun process so when you're when you're getting them in later the dogs that haven't had that solid foundation i mean because i look at me somebody that that i mean i feel like i can read dogs pretty well but i mean my plan was to go drop this cocker in the grouse woods with me and then i'm gonna tune up on that obedience after season's done and if i if i would do that and i'm sending it back to you and saying here jordan you know fix it i broke it yeah are you i mean what is it are you having a really hard time with them when you get them at that point well so how about i'll use a couple of examples to kind of illustrate how that normally looks so and every dog is definitely different for sure and i mean that's part of being a trainer is adapting but but generally speaking so when i when i study a dog which which in the flushing world means we want that dog to go in flush the bird in the air and then the dog sits and if the bird is shot we can send the dog to retrieve the bird if the bird is missed we just call the dog off and it goes back to hunting right so that that's what we would call a steady flushing dog when when i'm putting them through that studying process i the way that i do it is with mo well i started out with homing pigeons and i'll i'll have the dog sit on a cato board and i'll have a bag full of homing pigeons and i'll let a homing pigeon fly away and the dog will usually chase it maybe 40 yards to 50 yards and i just let it chase i don't call it i don't yell at it i just let it chase and when it comes back i flick out another homing kitchen dog chases it comes back i flick out another one chases it comes back and usually after usually after it's chased about five or six of them you can see the dog's starting to get a little bit tired and it's also starting to realize when it comes back to me there's another bird like maybe i shouldn't run so far right and once that once i see the dog starting to think that way like you can tell the dog is figuring out huh if i stay here there's more birds then i'll overlay a verbal command for that dog to stay there so we use the word hup which h2p which is the equivalent of sit for everybody else in the dog world which why do we use huff i don't know but so i'll say hup i let the pigeon fly away and i'll let the pigeon fly over my shoulder so i'm kind of in between the dog and that pigeon and normally at this point the dog is it's worked with me enough it's calm enough like okay i'll sit here pigeon flies away i tell it it's a good dog i'll throw a retrieve for it so i'll pull out a quickly pigeon or a dead pigeon and throw a retreat for it it brings it back to the dog back on the cato board watch a couple more pigeons fly away throw a couple more retrieves for it so the the dog is learning well and i mean this is gonna i'm sorry because i'm gonna jump all over here when when i start with a young dog like say it's eight weeks old 10 weeks old i want it to like i don't care about a a young puppy doing a long retrieve i don't care about it doing anything like this spectacular i'm not trying to like develop a 10 week old puppy more i'm trying to instill a mindset in that dog that behaviors have consequences whether good or bad so they learn oh if i do this good things happen if i do this good things happen they start to learn to offer behaviors in order to get what they want and that kind i mean i'm sure you're really familiar with clicker training yeah and that's that's the concept right oh if i do this behavior we're shaping behaviors so if i do this behavior there's a click there's a treat i'll do that behavior again click treat click treat and and we're teaching that dog basically to work with within a set of rules and to offer behaviors and to like interact with us right it's really a mindset and and we're developing that mindset and it's it's no dif i always like to correlate dog training to people because i think there's so many similarities but it's no different than with the human brain like we can cultivate the human brain and we can shape it and mold it and turn it into like i mean there's some kids that because of their environment are much better at learning than other kids that are maybe in a really undisciplined environment and they're just not so good at learning it doesn't mean that their brain can't be like they can't be helped i guess it would be the word but but environments definitely shape our brain so i want to shape these puppies brains so that they learn when i offer the right behavior i get what i want when i don't offer the right behavior i don't get what i want so real simple concept right but but yeah we miss it often so so that dog now by the time it's eight months old and we're going through this an arbitrary eight months but roughly eight months it's when it's sitting on that cater board and it watches a pigeon fly away and then it gets to retrieve a pigeon like oh i understand this concept when i offer this behavior of sitting here i get the reward that i want and when i chase that pigeon 100 yards across the field i don't get what i want there was no reach i never caught that bird and there was no retreat but if i stay here i get to retreat so really it's really a simple concept and if their brain has been developed the right way they understand how those concepts work and that process usually goes really quickly on the flip side i'll use a story here i had i sold a puppy to a guy and it was a pretty high-powered breeding like they were not gonna be like lazy lap dogs that didn't want like i knew there was a lot of drive in this dog and the guy came back to me when the that puppy was probably about 12 months old maybe 14 months old and he wanted to have a training session so i i okay what like what do you want to work on he's like oh i mean we don't really need to work on anything i just kind of want to see how you do things um he already does everything really really well we don't really need to work on anything okay so he's like what happens if i let go of a holding pigeon right now what'll he do well he'll just watch it fly away like really like did you train him to do that no he just does it naturally so i pulled the homie pigeon out of my bag and i i let it go and this dog chased it until it was like a speck in the distance and the guy is yelling at it and like it was the funniest thing i was i mean i had to act like i wasn't laughing but i inside i was laughing and i mean the guy was all worked up and he i failed to mention he had hunted that dog the season before so it was 8 9 10 11 months old when he hunted it and he went to a lot of game farms so the dog had had a lot of birds and the dog was a puppy when he did that so the dog was kind of i mean it was an adolescent it wasn't really confident so it wasn't chasing birds 100 or 200 yards because they didn't have that kind of confidence but by the time he showed up to my place the dog loved birds and knew it loved birds it didn't have a lot of control and now it had the con the confidence to just go so so it chases i pasture on my property and it's out running around in the past way out there the guy's yelling at it like just they can't even hear you just like just be quiet so finally the dog comes back and he the guy's got his veins are kind of popping a little bit in his neck like he's pretty upset and i'm still just i was still kind of just enjoying it so before you could catch the dog i flicked another pigeon out and he's yelling at it the dog turns runs and we like we went through the same thing again and uh yeah i did it he didn't yell at you to like stop throwing the i think he was really i think he was really embarrassed but the funny thing was i really like i it wasn't like i i knew it was just really predictable what was going to happen and i just kind of thought it was funny that he didn't and we and we were training like i'm actually training that dog even though it's running 200 yards out there chasing this bird it is being trained because it is figuring out that it's not going to catch that bird and that's the beauty of pigeons you know you don't have to worry about a pigeon landing out in the field the dog's never going to catch a pigeon once it flies off but but that's typically what i see when a dog comes to me that's already had a hunting season or a couple of hunting seasons it's out of control like you said my dog is broke right he's like he's not hunting for me he's way too big he's out of control it's it's a lot harder to reel that dog in because with a puppy it chased that bird 30 yards and then it came back and then it chased 30 yards and then came back and then 20 yards and then 10 yards and then it wasn't chasing that dog that's a year and a half old has so many bad reps in it and it got away with murder so many times it takes a lot more to start reeling that dog in because once i mean once you have that taste of being independent and kind of going rogue it's it's hard to give that up like they they're feeding off of it so we can avoid them ever going rogue i guess you could say right it just saves a lot of heartache yeah and that comes with so in the pointing world we say it's um it's easy to pull them in it's hard to push them out but with a spinner you don't you don't want to push down yeah you don't want them pushed out with a spaniel so it makes complete sense to do everything i would call it backwards but sure yeah yeah well i think you guys are just doing it backwards but and the other the other thing every dog i mean again we're jumping around but if one thing i always tell people like if you own that dog you are a dog trainer and every dog is different so you can't try to force that dog onto the pages of a book or into a podcast or whatever like that dog is it is a unique individual so the things that i say the things that that people write generally speaking they they will typically work but there's always going to be one-offs right and and as a dog trainer and if you're a dog owner you're a dog trainer you do have to be able to adapt to the dog in front of you so you may have a dog that really doesn't have a lot of drive it just naturally it does not have a lot of drive and if you start putting up too much control in that dog at a young age it may be really hard to get that dog to hunt how you want it to later on so right yeah you have you do have to adapt to the dog in front of you you don't want to just say boy my dog is slow and lazy but i'm going to drill obedience into that dog and then hope that it goes out and hunts that might not be the the best approach but but typically with a well-bred spaniel that we know likes birds we know it can run it moves nice control is going to be way more important than than getting it to go out so we use the same method with the with the pigeons we do the same thing and so when when are you doing that drill with them at what age like so of your own your own dogs what are you what age are they when you're throwing pigeons for them first um so i i may and and every dog is different so if but if it's probably we're going to say the average dog here and it's one that we'll say that i've owned it since it was eight weeks old so it's i'm not fixing things with it necessarily i may be fixing things i screwed up i'm not fixing up fixing something somebody else screwed up but right usually at say nine to ten months old i might start going through that steadiness process it might be more like 11 months old with a lot of them wow but but i prior to that for me personally i don't like them chasing birds prior to that i do want them finding some birds depending on depending on the dog's personality but i'll use a lot of clipping pigeons for that so i can go out in a field and put down a couple of clipping pigeons and then bring the dog back through and it finds the bird catches it and brings it back to me which you wouldn't want that with the pointer because we don't want them you don't want the pointer catching a bird in the field necessarily but with the flushing dog i just want them to find them flush them and retrieve them well the bird can't fly i wanted to find it catch it and bring it back to me and so it's it's catching birds it's learning to use its nose but it's not getting bad reps of ie chasing a bird across the field because the bird can't fly and then let's let's say i go out there with a with a seven or eight month old puppy and that thing like it knows there's birds in the field and it wants to go and it just starts tearing across the field well that that's a problem right like now we've got a young dog that's already figuring out that if it goes away from me it's gonna find birds so at that point we're not gonna have birds in the field anymore because i don't want that dog figuring out if it goes 200 yards away from me it can find birds so i want it to think birds are always within that like 20 to 25 yard range from me so what i'll do then maybe i'll go out and act like i'm putting out birds in the field or you know we simulate it like everything's normal but the birds are actually just in my bag so now when the dog starts to head down the field that's too far away i'll put in a bird closer to me like 10 feet away from me and i'll call the dog back in and put it right on the bird and you know we're starting to condition that behavior oh birds are in close when he blows his whistle he the guy seems to always know when there's a bird there right and that's what the dog starts thinking um so but but i'm i'm really only doing that with clipping birds up until i go through that steadiness process which is somewhere in that 10 11 month old range for you i mean if you get a cocker or flusher of any sort i you're not planning on field trialing so steadiness really is optional at that point i mean you may say i want a really polished flushing dog and i want it i want to train it to the highest level so it's going to be steady and that's awesome nothing says you have to do that though you may just want a flushing dog that when it flushes a bird if the bird isn't shot like let's say it's a hen pheasant or you miss the bird which probably never happens right but maybe you do or you know whatever i don't want the dog chasing at 200 yards that's that's a little bit easier to train but but the steadiness process fixes all those issues right like a steady dog is never going to chase a bird across the field right right so on that note i'm really curious um to get your insight on this so i feel like some of our best dogs are the ones that are very independent um so i would say my our best hunting dogs like the ones we really enjoy hunting over they lack a little bit of that cooperation obedient and i shouldn't say obedience i'd say more cooperation uh and possibly trainability just because they're always on they're always um ready to go and do something not hold still whereas like some of our our dogs that are the most well accomplished highest titles are really um they're extremely trainable very obedient super cooperative but they're not necessarily the ones that i personally enjoy hunting over you know they can they can accomplish all the titles because they have those great characteristics but they aren't the ones that have that i don't know that passion that grit that edginess that i really enjoy um out in the field with me yeah that's totally true of the spaniel totally i mean you're these are those are like verbatim the words that i have said to people about speech so it's funny okay is is that tied into gender at all or is that just no no correlation to gender no no no correlation i just like there were like our first three dogs that we had um at the navda invitational like just some of the you know coolest dog best dogs we've ever hunted over but like they just couldn't keep it together um because it's basically a huge obedience test and they need to be appeal all the time and i'm just like you know it might have earned its vc today but this is i'd ready to hunt this dog at the top of my line tomorrow so yeah i mean what about for you yeah so i definitely see that um i would say so i have two national champions breeze and cato one is a much better wild bird dog than the other uh i i've also found in the spaniels the females seem to be better wild bird hunters than the males like the the males seem to be more content to do exactly what they're told whereas the females seem to be i i use the word creative like they seem to be a little bit more creative with their hunting and it doesn't always look intelligent [Laughter] some of my friends when they heard i was going to be on the bird dog babe podcast had some funny comments and so many i wanted to repeat and then no i can't do it do it no do it it's good don't won't do it won't take debate but uh it it very well may be intel i don't know but the females do see interestingly enough because you think of the males being like hard charging pounders like you know more more like aggression not like angry aggression but just like a more physical type dog right sure but the the females in my experience will go longer than the males will they typically they seem to be better at by just figuring out wild birds and finding them and then the males like i i have a couple like i have rocky who now he's almost 11 years old so he doesn't he doesn't do a lot anymore but he's placed second at a nationals he's hunted his whole life he's hunted all across the midwest and i think he's finished three three nationals which is an i mean he's an accomplished style dog and he's a and he's a full sister to breeze and then i so i rocky and then i have cato and cato's won the nationals both of those dogs like if we went hunting you would probably well maybe not you but the average person would would be like mesmerized by how smooth they are and how they just do what they're supposed to do and just run nice and then i'll put breeze down and breeze is like she can be a little bit frustrating at times i mean she'll pull your chain a little bit uh and she's a little bit more independent than i would like but she and it won't look it won't necessarily look good but she fine but she does find way more birds than the males do and i have another another female gandhi who is she's the same way like it doesn't always look pretty but she just has like more i i'm gonna go back to the word creativity like they're just more creative and how they attack the cover and they they don't seem to get beat up like the males do you know some of the grouse cover we go in has a lot of thorns and gnarly stuff and the males will you know they'll be all tore up in the face and the females come out and they look like they just put their makeup on you know they're all like they're all cute still and the males are dripping blood and but the females have done just as much work they just attacked it differently than the males did so yeah i i i definitely but you know that it goes back with the spaniels there's still that balance of i want some independence i want some i mean i sure don't want to be directing a bird a dog the whole time i'm hunting with it like i just wanted to go hunt and if i want to put it in a certain spot i sure want it to listen to the whistle you know i want it to give give me ground and listen to me when i want it to listen to me but the rest of the time i want it to be an independent hard-charging hunting dog so there's there's some balance there but but ultimately like if that dog isn't hunting for me in some capacity it's probably gonna be a really frustrating hunt and it's i mean it's been 25 years since my original cato and i still have like vivid memories of running after that dog trying to keep up with it while it was flushing birds up ahead of me and being so frustrated and that probably like dictated the rest of my life like that's probably why the pendulum swung so far to the other side like that was not fun so many ruined hunts so many birds that got away because the dog flushed them out of range like let's not ever do that again and uh so now yeah sorry go ahead no i just can say so do you find yourself like choosing the like freezer gandhi as your choice that you the dogs that you would pull out first that you really enjoy hunting over because they have a little bit more of that independence creativity it actually so that actually kind of depends on where i'm hunting so if i feel like i'm going into a really game rich environment and it's gonna be a shorter hunt i might pull out rocky or cato if if i'm going somewhere where i think maybe it's not going to be quite so game rich you know we're going to have to go a little bit farther and not find nearly as many birds then i'm more inclined to pull out one of the females okay because i i figured they may get a little farther out than the males they may they're going to be a little bit more creative and they uh i typically find they're going to produce birds in those situations better than than the males will do you find that they'll they're more likely to come apart if there's like a lot of bird action going on like that their control string is just a little bit shorter it's so so funny i am painting with a pretty broad brush here but but the males may actually like come apart i guess more like they may actually like that whole eyes roll back into the head lose their mind sort of thing the the females i don't think it's so much that they come apart i think it's that they're devious little things and they take advantage like they they figure out like when they can take ground you know when they can get away with stuff and it's not and it's more calculated than the males i think if that if that makes any sense at all but like totally like in training i'll have the males typically are more honest in training like they do what they're supposed to do and they just enjoy doing it and whatever you want boss and that's good and the the the females they they tend to be more like trying to manipulate the rules and checking to see if the rules are the same today and it's so it's not coming apart as in i lost my mind and i don't know what i'm doing it's more it's more being devious it's so funny this seems like a great podcast to to tell this story so you and you said you can edit things out so free so add it to your list that's probably already there but uh when i got my very first cocker i called the the guy that i was gonna get it from i called him up and he said yeah i'm gonna have a litter in a few months um and you can get on the list and he's like do you want a male or a female and i said i'd like a female and he said okay well like why do you want a female and i had i i had no idea what i was doing and i was like well aren't the females a little bit easier to train and he goes they are and he's like well i mean i are they i don't know are they and he's like well he's like you know why they call them [ __ ] right and uh that's always that's always stuck with me because there was way more truth to that than what i realized at the time like they they are devious right but but if you can manage it i think they're in my experience a little bit better humming dogs for me anyway no and i i'm probably gonna like sorry what no you think you're probably gonna i was gonna say i probably just created the extra demand on female talkers which there's already a shortage so kudos to me yeah well it has to take you know a really dedicated person to it sounds like to have them at that level though i mean to be able to keep that under control so yeah i was gonna say first for a lot of people a male probably is a better choice honestly right and i think across maybe across the board then because when people ask the differences between male and females with like with my my worried the german wirehair pointer um i tell them about the same that you just described that where like you know the males are more likely to just cuddle with you if you want them to where the the [ __ ] are like i'll come to you if i want it and you know like and my husband prefers the females because he thinks that they mature early on and they hold it together where the males take a while to get to the level where he likes them but they hold it together eventually he just doesn't he he likes a a dog that's serious and ready to work early on would you would you i could definitely see okay yeah i could i can see so the females i think maybe get bored with training faster than the males do so if you're doing more repetitive training i think it i think it takes a little more skill with the females than it does with the males but just like raw maturity like i i think part of the reason they don't train quite as well is because they did mature faster and they're they're bored by repetitive stuff like they've so if you were focusing more on hunting than training i can definitely see an advantage there with the females if you're focusing more on training than than hunting the the male might actually you know you might almost in your mind think well the male matured faster than the female but it's really like the male is just more easily entertained with simple things what's your dog though carry on um what's your personal feeling on um hunting cockers or i should just be general hunting a flusher and a pointer together so i don't espouse to the idea of like letting dog learn dogs learn from other dogs really so i wouldn't want to take out a pointer and a flusher and like hope that they that like two poorly trained ones and hope that they somehow figure out together that hey you do that job and i'll do this job and it'll be awesome um so i i i think it can it can definitely be done but i would want one of those dogs to be really well trained before i introduced the other and really i probably would want the pointer to be the one that's really well trained and then work the cocker up into it because i mean some of these dogs are really really competitive in any breed so if a competitive pointer sees a a flusher flushing its bird and retrieving it and you could create some issues with that pointer so but but i think if you've got a well-trained pointer that isn't going to get frustrated giving up the flush and the retrieve to a spaniel or to a flusher and if you have a flusher that isn't out of control and that you can bring it in and put send it in to flush in front of that pointer i mean i think that can be a really i know i mean that can be a really awesome experience and a great combination but but you definitely want to train those dogs separately before you put them together that probably went without saying i haven't seen the combination look amazing yet i know it's out there i know it can happen and i'm really anxious to to see that combination but um and i guess only a couple of times personally that i've hunted um or been with a flushing dog and my pointers you know they're whether they're not trained enough it could be the problem but i just wonder how many more times that pointing dog is gonna allow that bird to be flushed before it just stops pointing because you know it just oh that's how we get the bird is if you go chase it type of thing right and then it's being right i don't have i mean you're you're the pointing dog expert so i'll rely on you for that one but the flusher will gladly keep flushing in front of that one sure right right no but i agree i i would think and i don't know probably for any of your listeners that have both or considering both they're they're probably i mean maybe it's too big of an assumption but you probably have some experience and you probably know what you're doing you probably can train the dog if you're adding multiple dogs to your stream um so i mean i i would want to be reading that pointer hey is it getting frustrated am i starting to see issues pop up and if that's happening then i probably want to back off but on the other hand a lot of pointers don't like to retrieve that much so how is it different sending a cocker in to flush the bird then you going in to flush the bird either way the pointer wasn't flushing and if it didn't really care about retrieving to begin with who cares that the copper is retrieving so i you know i think for a lot of pointers it would probably be a non-issue right right i the pointers every situation is unique yeah yeah true i just i think the more ideal combination you're right would be pointer setter um and a flusher then then maybe like the ver instead of the versatile breeds like a wire hair short hair vishal the ones that just overthink every situation and try to escape around it going okay that thing's gonna take my birds well then i'm just gonna go in and get it yeah just run run the flusher with the male dog that won't overthink it carries that white chromosome they'll get them every time the hole is just getting deeper just yeah so let's let's circle around because there were i know we're in about an hour here but i do want to um i had some training questions and maybe that's just going to have to be for a different podcast in general but so the cato board and helping with the issue of the dog that on the retrieve likes to parade around um and how awesome utilizing that place board and you know in general to be able to clean up that retrieve giving that dog the object of this is exactly where you need to come back to and present the bird um do you want to touch on that a little bit i don't need to keep going on yeah sure so interesting i mean the training can get so complex even though it's so simple at its root but a lot of times when that dog is coming back parading around it it may be because it's actually parading around and showing it off it also may be because it feels a little bit of pressure coming into you um you know we like to uh anthropomorphize right like we like to put human characteristics on that dog like do dogs really show off like that well yeah maybe they do but i a lot of times it's because that dog isn't comfortable just coming in because maybe you've been really grabby in the past you squared your shoulders up like you've made it unintentionally but you've made it uncomfortable for that dog to come in and give you the object so it may actually be the pressure that's causing it to do that parading around so with the platform and i'll use the cato board just in the generic sense so if the cato board if that dog from early on learned that good things happened on that cato board and that there was no pressure associated with it there was only reward associated with it when it's coming back with that object and it sees the cato board it's coming back to a familiar comfortable spot that never changes and it's that's a lot easier for a dog whereas if i'm bringing if i'm calling the dog back to me i'm i mean i'm a living being i change my my tone of voice changes my volume changes the angle of my shoulders change my arms extending and retracting i mean there's there's a lot of things going on with people that we're not aware of necessarily because we just do them naturally that can cause discomfort to the dog like not physical discomfort but just mental discomfort like if if you think about uh i i've used this on other podcasts with other people who i always call it like the it's like the 100 pound gorilla hand like if you think about a little puppy coming back with a tennis ball in its mouth and here's here's you know some guy's hand or some woman's hand coming to take that ball out of the dog's mouth and the hand is like twice the size of their head and we don't think of it like oh we're just we're just happy the dog's doing its thing and we're just going to take the ball from its mouth now if you imagine like on if if you were retrieving a ball i mean this is this is kind of whatever extreme but let's say you were the one retrieving and it was a two thousand pound person and you came back and that two thousand pound person was going to put their hand into your face and take something out of your mouth like that that'd be a little bit awkward right i mean that's not as simple as we like as we think it is for that dog so so if i can put that cable board there and i call the dog back into the cato board so my shoulders and hopefully you have a camera on me right now because i'm actually like acting this out as i'm talking over the phone no okay so i'll try i'll do my best here so i'm i'm sideways to the cato board i'm squared up with the cato board but my my the dog is off to my side so the dog's coming across in front of me onto the cato board so my shoulders never squared up to the dog they were always turned sideways in a more not necessarily submissive but not in an aggressive stance right so i'm turned sideways and i'm just calling the dog back onto that platform and the platform produces no or generates no stress for that dog because the platform doesn't change the volume of its voice it doesn't move around it doesn't get grabby it just it's just a platform it's just a cato board sitting there it's comfortable for that dog to hop onto so it runs back jumps on the cato board i can pet it tell it it's a good dog and then as an afterthought i take the ball away from that dog without it really even thinking about it i i have found for the majority of dogs doing that just that process right there cleans up so much of that parading because it took away the stress the stress of the hand off right that was a really long explanation for no so think about think about this like if if we can throw a ball or a bird or whatever 40 yards and that dog runs out as fast as it can and it turns and it runs back and then when it gets 10 feet away from us things start getting screwy where maybe the dog drops the ball or it runs around us you know why can that dog run all the way out and then 95 of the way back and then and then things fall apart well the only thing that like it's us right it's the bubble around us so we just need to change that bubble we need to make it so it doesn't get stressful it doesn't it's not awkward for that dog to come into our bubble right so the dog is telling you when it does that stuff it's telling you that there's something wrong with your bubble right and i think of the things that we do you know when they're puppies when they're grabbing the kids socks and we're chasing after them and ripping it out of their mouth and telling them you know no and and and how much they're relating it to that is every time i come to you you're just taking things away from me and yelling at me so yeah i think it's helpful to be more aware of how we handled those situations um it's like the dog running away and finally comes back and then yelling at it you know they they didn't learn that i was wrong for running away they now they just learned i'm getting yelled you know yelled at for coming back to you so yep um but yeah that's another lots of little things it's it's all about like being a dog trainer you know i'll use the illustration like if you have a kid you're a parent and if you have a dog you're a dog trainer you know like that's that's just how it that's how it is if you you can't you know it always frustrates me when people say like i'm not really a dog trainer but i have a dog well no you you are you you may be a really bad dog trainer but you actually are training a dog if you own a dog whether you want to train it or not so a lot of it is like hey like just wake up realize you're a dog trainer because you own a dog and you don't need to do it perfectly and you don't have to do it exhaustively you know you don't have to train for two hours a day but just be really intentional about what you're doing and if you're having an issue like one be honest that you're having an issue but then work your way through it like problem solve figure out what do i need to do to change this and there might be five different answers to your problem but find one that works for you and change you know if you're having a problem with your dog most likely it's heavily tied into environment you know somehow it's tied into your interaction or something that that dog is doing so think about it logically what can i change in the environment what can i change in my interaction with that dog what can i do to fix that issue and it's not a it's not rocket science and it's not like some uh abstract like i mean it's all really pretty logical if we just sit down and think through it and you know put on our dog trainer hat you're exactly right that's my soapbox i like it well we'll end on your soapbox note okay jordan how can how can people find you um so i
