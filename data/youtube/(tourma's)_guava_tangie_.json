{"BeGuK8VsOjY": "[Music] hi my name's Chris I work here at the Medicine Wheel natural healing in all d'Urville First Nation today I'll be doing a product review on the strain called sour tangi Sour tangi is a sativa dominant hybrid with 80% sativa genetics as well as 20% indica genetics some of the expected medicinal value of the strain are to treat things like depression fatigue and even stress the expected effects of course as it is a sativa are to feel things like uplifted euphoric and even energetic at some times the expected flavors from Sour tangi are things like citrus orange and even a hint of diesel now of course here at the Medicine Wheel we do test all of our products for potency and widths our Tanjung you can expect anywhere between 20 and even 28% THC [Music]", "pxypGFtebds": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm gonna be taking a look at Nava new cannabis strain this is sour tangi more specifically this is London sour tangi it is a phenotype of Sour tangi let's talk about the background of the sour tangi cannabis strain I want to big up to sloppy toffee for the London salwar tangi this is regular sour tangi which is east coast sour diesel crossed with tangi this is just a phenotype that you are more likely to come across in London we see this now and then we've cannabis trains sometimes you get a London version a London lemon or a London this or that really it's a market in terms of their to show where the strain or the pheno has come from and just to make it that little bit more appealing for Londoners it is a sativa strain the crosses the chattiness of the East Coast Sour Diesel with the potent power and tur penis of the tangi cannabis strain there are apparently different phenotype variations some leaned more towards the East Coast Sour Diesel some leaned more towards the tangi DNA genetics reserved our provider as well who also made the Holy Grail cush they're the makers of this our Tandy and I am excited to try it guys let's talk about the appearance of Sour tangi Londyn sour tangi guys let us have a look at you that's pretty standard 3.5 bag I'm seeing a lot of these bags about branded across the front with the London sour tangi branding something else I'm seeing quite a lot its individual strains by individual growers and collectives have their own artwork which is pretty cool so we have got the gas lab 420 London Salva 10 G in our hands right here 26 percent THC nought point three percent CBD are cooled into the packet inside the bag we have this weed flux somehow don't look quite as tidy I think there's little scraps of leaf uniform green look to him not the most sort of dense and compact but this looks organic it doesn't look like it's been grown with PG ours or with anything that's gonna really bulk it out I've got more of a sort of natural look to it the pistols are sunken into the bud there and the bud structure is nice but not super developed more on this at either side of the bud structure this time it's bit more spindly steel hybrid so you can see that influence creeping in there I think for bag appeal is not all that but it still looks really nice it looks kind of dusty but it's not listening in the light this particular batch there's no glistening trichomes it's more of a sort of dusted with trichomes not a lot of complexity to the bud so not a lot of shades of green I'll happily smoke it and just wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 in terms of the appearance let's talk about the smell of the London sour tangi you time to get a gauge of that aroma here we go that is the strongest smelling cannabis train that I had smelt in at least a couple of months wowza as soon as you open the bag those oranges that the tangi are out in full force it is a really strong lemon n citrusy smell before the buds been broken before it's been ground down the surface area has been increased no it doesn't need it this stuff absolutely stinks and the smell is like air it's like an orange soft drink like an orange aid or an orange tango type smell to it ten out of ten for smell and that is before I've even broken it open so let us break the bud in half there we go house up it smells like that orange spray there's like a dank orange air freshener that you can get I've seen it for sale in a couple of shops fat town shopping signs has got it other side London's got it and it is a orange air fragrance to cover up the aroma of cannabis this smells like that like completely that type of orange that level of strength it is like that air freshener is not going to cover this up I'll tell you that much of add to it let's put some in the grinder so what I am noticing look as you can tell as I've broken it open it's not as like dense and compact it's got really nice smell to it the orange citrus is like almost on the edge of strawberry really sweet ridiculously strong let's talk about the taste of the sour tangi today we're covering the London sour tangi cannabis strain we have looked at it we have smelt it we've discussed the background now it's time to taste some I've got my tongues Widowmaker I've also got my mighty vaporizer just so we can get a good idea of the exact flavor profile of this strain which the mighty doesn't excellent job in and demonstrate him so we're going to start with a bomb and get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs ready de briques heated up hit that pause button if you need to I'm about to smoke this and I will see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] definitely organically grown that is a really smooth really really nice smoking experience even comparatively to other bongs and really enjoyed that smoke the orange comes through it's not quite tangi flavor but if you smoked Angie you know what I'm talking about it is a turf monster there tangi strain and that has really carried through into the flavour of this which is super apparent even smoking it through the Bob I might see vaporizer is now ready filled with the London salwar tangi I'll see you all on other side Cheers [Music] got that tangi sweetness that grapefruit as well it's not just an orange the tangents like between an orange and a grapefruit in it this is the phenotype that leans more to the tangi side the East Coast Sour Diesel I'm not really tasting it that much in here is I'm not tasting it that much [Music] slight hints of pie a slight like kasi notes flavor-wise and out ten really really nice in both the mighty and in the bong as well let's talk about the effects of London salwar tangi so this particular Fino this albert angie is apparently clocking in around the 26 percent THC mark that makes it nice and strong stronger than most of the stuff that I've reviewed actually which probably sits around the late teens early twenties some of it goes all the way up to the late twenties like the Kalle poem but this is still a strong kind of a strain it is on the sativa side I'm feeling the uplift kicking in nice and quickly I noticed it after only a couple of minutes actually it was the first thing that kicked in was just stuck up or just feel kind of good happy uplifted definitely cannabinoids in my endocannabinoids system it's not like a cloudy sativa it's more of an inspirational sort of happy feeling like I still feel motivated I feel like this is a good one for daytime smoking not something that's just gonna make me super super higher in a way that stops me getting on with my work or whatever I would do it's a nice happy feeling I've got this bomb here left over from the flavor I want to smoke this again and just increase the level of those effects that I'm feeling join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] Wow so that was a more smoke more volumous still tasted great fantastic lovely smoking experienced that one the sour 10g and effects wise yeah it's on this at either side so happy still relaxed euphoric motivated is another good one I'd say this is more of a clear-headed to tea but probably coming from the Sour Diesel side of it which is that definite motivational smoke like and smoke that and clean my house Sour Diesel let's sum things up so today we've been consuming the London salvat ng a phenotype of saltan G which is East Coast sour diesel crust with tangi the tangi flavor just comes through and just dominates in this phenotype it really tastes like oranges with a bit of grapefruit thrown in there for good measure appearance-wise wasn't the greatest looking bit of Bud compared to some of the nuts you've seen on the channel recently but smell wires 10 out of 10 this stuff smells incredible it is a really strong sweet citrus lemon n smell that comes out on the back straightaway carries through into the flavour even when smoking it in a bong traditionally one of the less flavors and ways of consuming it tastes great smooth as anything votes lovely apparently twenty six percent THC called into the packet if it was twenty six percent THC then I'd probably be a lot higher now I think my eyes are probably showing there is nice and strong not really inebriated maybe it's just because of the type of high that it is the fact that it is really strong and I'm just feeling like I can carry on and get on with my day just shows what the high is but maybe it's because it's not quite up to that that percent now the percentage of THC can vary depending on batch by batch basis loads of factors that will affect the amount of THC produced in the plant as well so always take the exact THC percentages with a pinch of salt particularly so for Kelly stuff but in the UK it might just be that that's for a previous batch or something like that and it's still put the same package in but I don't know it could be I can't say for sure until unless I tested it myself overall I really like this bug guys and it is scoring really highly what do you think of the London sour tangi have you tried it before leave your thoughts in the comments I am trying to get to 50 thousand YouTube subscribers we're more than halfway there but still quite a weight off so

[Music]", "SC99iukFCgk": "[Music] hey what's up everybody cows coming back at you with a little strand review here for some tangent from Polaris this this is gonna be a little quick review tangey is one of my favorite strains as far as flavor goes it's one of the best citrus flavors in my opinion out there as well you know it's smell taste the whole nine yards so immediately you know let's jump right into you know we got some nice dense kind of fluffy nubs first and foremost this company Polaris they test they shoulders at 25.2% th c8 teach the eight not easy but th CA oh just like CHCA so it sounds good that's crazy okay so realistically it's anywhere between like 18 19 to 20 21 percent THC somewhere you know my husband should probably uh okay you know what it's closer than what they're selling you so but it does look good like blind the guy is there for six [Music] it does have some frosting yes - it looks good looks tasty I'd like it anyway all right so immediately you know the looks I give it a a 8 out of 10 and it's dead frosty it's orange it has the line greens and the light filled vibrant greens that you're looking for the Tandy's note which is a good quality of something that I can it kenji is also known for being a super upbeat happy yet relaxing about hi to it [Music] so you know this is one of my wake yeah this is definitely a wake and bake strain this is one of those I wake up in the morning I love a bullet Angie it's a perfect start the day kind of strength gets you uplifted because you still mellow out you're relaxed relaxed it's not gonna hit you super hard you know even though they do you know like I said there's percent rate shows like thinking you know it's gonna mess you up pretty bad but it doesn't you know it's just real mellow high which is something good okay so looks 8 out of 10 okay go on to the smell now the smell on here is amazing I'd love to smell Tanja's why it's one of my number-one strains it's my top you know top five favorite strings as tangi expel as tangerine jeering I love that citrus you know smells to him you know super lemon haze stuff like that anyways so as far as smell goes immediately it's just a burst of citrus you know it smells like you have just like a whole bunch of tangerines just being torn open in your face at once it's crazy the smell is just so overpowering and just pungent and vibrant it's amazing nine out of ten smell honestly I honestly 10 out of 10 smell 10 out of 10 smell when it comes to tangi because it is such a flavorful smell this is something they give you don't like the skunky buggy you know we smelled it you know we're so used to in a lot of our things this is a strain for you this is one that you know you're not gonna every time you come to smoke you're not gonna be thinking about oh I'm smoking weed that is how vibrant this this smell comes across it's incredible on the taste honestly this is a mouth-watering taste you know I'm not gonna lie I love it it's like I said it's one of my absolute favorites one of my number recommended for flavor for people because you know some people they not only are they looking for medicine but they're looking for taste some people don't like you know the diesel II tasted we get from like perfect example Sour Diesel or the oily kind of a burnt taste you get from someone like like Northern Lights kind of gives you that that kind of an ashy kind of a thick taste leftover this gives you this off you know this amazing citrus smell to just develop your senses it's crazy alright let's take a hit here we go so Polaris I've seen this company a couple times down they've seen that make you know pretty decent products you know if I was to rate the company you know I give them you know they're like a four-star company as far as I'm concerned I haven't had any bad product from them okay so uh man it's good taste immediately the same smells that you're getting you're gonna taste it just citrus I mean almost tastes like you're biting into like a tangerine at the same time you're taking a drink of like orange juice man it's just a overpowering citrus you know I love that it's amazing now I do have to say if if you I don't know if you younger generation may not remember these but out Lloyd's used to make a candy and they were sour and they were tangerine flavored candies there are little circle things in a little silver tin that is what if you guys remember that that is exactly what this tastes and smells like and it's incredible imma go ahead and grab another one like I said it's one of my favorites here we go it's amazing so as far as taste go 9 out of 10 has such an amazing smooth citrus taste to it I love it so now the best part about this is the high the high is a mellow high on it so it's not gonna you know I'm gonna give this a 4 the high I give it honestly like a 7 out of 10 because it's not overpowering it doesn't come on very quickly it's smooth when you as you're smoking or you know even get your hands on some concentrate you know I don't know the concentrate might hit you super fast I haven't been lucky enough to find the concentrate this stuff is phenomenal as far as flour goes so no matter where you go in my opinion if you get a chance to pick up some tangi grab it it's a phenomenal strain I mean who doesn't want a wonderful flavor with a wonderful smell and in a wonderful hi all in the same time like I said I recommend this honestly for some of our elderly patients I would definitely recommend this too because of the flavors it's gonna keep them off that that we kind of you know off off sent that up there you know the G their generation is kind of stuck on so this would help somebody the you know needs to ease into the idea or the concept of smoking medical marijuana so this is definitely something I recommend as far as somebody who's new to this industry definitely something for them to try out but as always you know if you like the video like it down below you know if you guys got any comments questions anything like that let me know if there's a certain strain out there that you just want more information about you know you just haven't been able to pick up or find or you just you know are weary about grabbing it let me know I'm willing to test it for you I don't mind I'll pick it up I'll try it you know I'll let you know what my opinion is on it however as always make sure you guys subscribe and all my gift it out there you guys got a stay lifted guys out", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would up y'all there's a little bit of controversy

the strange show the show where we learn new fun facts about weed every week don't forget to subscribe so you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your stream brain so I've never even tried double tangi banana I've had this weed for like two days and I still haven't even hit it yet now double tangi banana is a cross of banana sherbert and tangi banana sherbert is a cross of sunset sherbert and banana Kush aunt Angie is a cross between lemon skunk and Callie orange that's a pretty impressive line up and double tanju banana won the second place NorCal cannabis cup or the best sativa concentrate in 2015 and for THC the sweetest testing it twenty three point one three percent pretty good now these are different strains we don't even need these right now but this is the double tangi banana and look how much I paid for it that's one dollar for three point six five grams well that's a good price for weed but it's only because I had some points and so I saved twenty six dollars and eighty cents so it would have been about twenty-seven books I haven't even smelled this weed yet and I haven't smoked any weed in hours and hours and hours to make sure I'm not stoned for the review so I'm excited to see what this smells like oh wow okay well that smells good smells like sweet and citrusy hello citrusy almost like a grapefruit and orange and a lemon all at the same time it looks alright it doesn't look too trucked out or anything it looks ok it looks decent it doesn't look hella tracked out but it doesn't look bad the smell is insane Oh smells so good like sweet citrus all right buddy let's load some of this up and see what it's smoking light [Music] and that's when the camera died so I didn't even have an ending to the Bond grip so I just loaded another bowl [Music] that's pickle ball grip nice nice it was sort of like a little sweet like a little sweet hint on the exhale among this whole thing see the ashes of like okay that's pretty light color - looks like the we got flushed pretty well when they were grown in and it tastes like it - like I said he's sort of like sweet it doesn't like that Bert the second time I hit it I didn't taste it as much but that first time I was just sitting there blown out from smoking minding my own business and it's like hmm mmm sweet hmm it was none of the citrus that I smelled in the bud before I smoked it I got a good how I fill it all behind my eyes for chili okay the bong grips are nice but let's see how this weed hits in pipe I'm thinking I'm gonna be able to get a lot more of the flavor of this weed out of this nice clean pipe rather than the bomb here we go buddy [Music] [Music] oh yeah definitely more flavor now I'm getting more of the citrus undertones it's also got some like earthy undertones like you can taste the cush in it hmm I'm going back in with all those cool through the damage to that bulb first time it's a nice smooth smoking weed this is nice pipe weed tastes good the flavors not crazy strong but it does taste very good if I had to close my eyes and maybe guess what it was I might guess like I'll probably say lemon might say cush something like that let's load another one reevaluate see if we get that same earthy undertones it's weird to describe the way things taste but that sounded like a good phrase I mean what's so good when you break it up I think this was like they're not they're top-shelf weed with a second shelf [Music] nice and smooth nice and smooth definitely like the cushy earthy taste you know what I'm talking about you know what I'm talking about you know exactly what I'm talking about if you don't know what I'm talking about I'm probably doing a bad job of describing it it tastes like nuts and wood in dirt in a good way in a really good way if that makes any sense at all makes my nose tickle it's a little bit makes me feel like I'm about to sneeze when I blow out the bowl it's a good sign I think it feels like the Terps are working on me you're doing work to my nose I like it I like the Sweden double tangi banana I like it I give it a thumbs up and a little pinky out look at that didn't even mean to do that but let's give it a minute let's say 20 minutes and we'll come back and see what the high off this weed is like okay I'll be right back Oh what's up alright it's been 20 minutes I took the bowl with me to hit it and I just started watching TV and sort of forgot so I guess that's a good thing I would say this weeds got a good hybrid feel it's not very racy and it's not very couch MLT it's a great in-between so overall I'd probably give this weed like a 7 out of 10 it's got a pretty good smell and pretty good taste and it looks alright - but it could do a little better in all three departments but the high is nice and I would recommend trying some so I smoked two bongs I loaded the pipe twice and I would say my Highness level is probably at a 7 out of 10 maybe a six and a half out of 10 but I did take the pipe to go watch TV and didn't even finish it sort of forgot I even so I would say that means I'm pretty high and I want to give a special thank you to the homies that made this review possible dirt Debbi Daniel

days ago over these Monday I cut this down on Saturday morning so we got you know about 48 hours just hanging straight with the whole root ball and everything let's just take a look at it here so we're hanging here I I hang them whole plant hanging root ball and all what I do is I'll put a two gallon bag over the buds a two gallon ziplock bag then I'll just close it down plate over the stem and then I pulled a plant out that way I don't get any dirt or medium on the plant and then I wrapped that and just like a shopping bag you know I don't think the whole root ball just kind of the primary roots that are there then I hang that on a a now just get a coat hanger you know and just hang that into the closet but I leave all the leaves on except for whatever ones that were obviously dead mostly I'll peel those off right away before I hang it but I leave all the families on for the first 48 hours to let all the sugars transfer I didn't water them for like a day but put them down that kind of really affected one of the plants here but you know we might be in a little trouble there as far as the quality but this one is looking really nice I'm gonna go ahead and give it a little bit of a trim up here and that way it can breathe a little bit better I'm aiming for sixty degrees Fahrenheit in the in the hanging room and sixty degrees humidity I don't like to I don't I don't like to dry it too fast when it's hanging the longer you can get it to dry without getting moldy while it's hanging the better you know some people stay fly up three five seven days that's still you know five days is too short of a time man anything over seven then you're getting into some quality tiering you're gonna lose that smell up in here see if we can do this I got my magnifying lens you can take a look at some of the trikes it's really hard to get in there like yeah here we go I'm hard to see if they're amber or not hurry up let me try something here it's hard to really get a view on the color of them for you and hold the camera steady where it's really focused but I can just tell you that a lot of these are really really milky but they're about 10 20 30 percent amber I'd say about 30 percent amber that's really the best time in my opinion all the everything is really all the CBDs and th these are balanced to where they're supposed to be you know we've got some really nice buds on this on this plant man I'm really happy with this nice dent buds they're not quite as dense as I thought they'd be I mean they were so super dense on the plant and while it's growing but I mean I think that'll be remin you know how they look when it when they dry up so we'll have to see you know we'll follow me along here I got a lot of stuff to do today I gotta give the grow room an overhaul now we're gonna clean out the flowering room and move the veg over and I don't know we might have to do a whole I'm gonna have a problem with my landlord here things are getting a little hairy he's getting upset about the about the plants but uh I think we can call them down if we you know I've got my paperwork i'm a medical grower you guys know that everything is legal I'm at my limits so you know we got the rest of the plants hanging in the closet I'm gonna give you a quick shot on that you know so I just hang them things upside down leaves it a lot as you can see and just get them nice and aired out for these ones came down last night after dark so you get them nice and aired out these are a couple branches off the Big Momma plant that you guys saw these came from the same plant they're here as the other branch that I just showed you there so yep we're doing we're doing pretty good man it is harvest time if you want to look real quick our pineapple express is just getting gigantic in the vegetation room right now under the happy leaf led that we did so well with the first time look at this mama is we gotta clean the grow room out here that is one big plant he's taking off about a 3x5 area right now that's just one mama so we gotta clean this out get the scrub over it and we'll be on our next run it's the Pineapple Express we've got the other clones running we got the clone machine going I don't know if I've showed that yet they're coming show that a great stopper peace train [ __ ] the government a bunch of deep 13 clones no these are pineapple express clones going in the hot water that I built this weekend so I think you're gonna be trying to build some more of those in the other vegetative plant I got it the bigger the mama g13 you've got some cuttings from that already they're healthy so we'll be lollipop knees and strong in these this week and we'll have videos of that you know it's my next run in here and I don't I'm not really afraid now to do some proper heavy manicuring and you know some breaking of the branches to get them in that straw properly a baby got a little tiny baby bottle flower in here yeah this is how big it is not even followed my hand I don't know stop growing leaves turn yellow I put a pinch of epson salt in there yesterday morning and now the leaves are back start coming green again and we got some more growth on the bottom but I mean look at the roots on this baby we got good roots you know so ever since I put that air stone in there we're getting some really nice rose here's our other g13 that I've been but this thing is probably about six months old it's just really been an experiment for whatever purpose I don't know I taking up Runa my grow room I'm probably embarrassed to say that it's how old it is but it's come it's gone and stopped up I've really just kind of messed with it quite a bit just to just to kind of see what would happen you know where I got some broken branches these are the plants where I'm not afraid to mess with them and just see what happens if I do little techniques that I read about that I'm not so sure about you know I'm not I'm not so worried about this plant dying it's taken a lot of abuse and it keeps coming back and now I've got the air stone in there this was our original cracky experiment no it's probably like two and a half months old but still it should be the same size as that pineapple Express if I took care of it the right way and we got some new baby see things going in here with that the polisher and what was that other one I forgot oh that's astro dog that one's looking really good Pollard's got this characteristic where the leaves kind of like curl up I don't know it's kind of strange I've been watering it properly and everything you know it's just it uh my buddy told me the same thing happened to him so I don't know be interesting to see how that comes out so yes this is good ground indoor if it's a call for your growing needs we're in Rutland Vermont very local July is coming soon and it's a good girl roads into gmail dot subscribe my channel and I like to subscribe you", "Tt0J8IivtWE": "what's going on stoners welcome back to the garden we are officially on season 3 episode 8 of the pheno hunt and this week I have a couple of upgrades to go over with you guys I have the next round of plants ready to go into flower as well as last week I did harvest my tangi plant and quick thing about that I was gonna put out an update last week but as I was rendering all of my files most of them got corrupted most the videos got corrupted I did I was able to back up the tangi harvest though so we will go ahead and jump into that real quick we'll do our dab and chug for the week and we will come back and see what's going into the flower but first comes first this tangi as you can see here has been in flush for two weeks today is day 72 of flower and she is really really just kind of looking like she's ready to get pulled honestly I did have some yellowing leaves on the green love potion that I showed you last time but I actually have some really necrotic leaves going on with this plan I mean this is completely dead which is a good sign that the plant is running out of nutrients in the cocoa medium and starting to leech out the last remaining nutrients from the from the fan leaves and things like that which is always a good thing what you typically want to do with your flushes is actually remove all nutrients so that you don't get any heavy metals or anything like that in your buds from what I understand and what I've heard from a lot of other growers though is the main thing the main chemical or whatever compound you want to get out of your medium is going to be the calcium and magnesium which is what causes that snap crackle pop that we sometimes get when burning like a fresh joint or a fresh bowl all opinion though I would encourage anyone out there that's really worried about it to do their own research and feel free to throw down anything you find out in the comments so that I can elaborate and on the next episode if possible anyways let's get back to the star of the segment this tangi as I've said is at day 72 and flower it's growing in a number five pot filled in with a coco perlite mix and that is reused coco my reused coco I just pull out any major roots any big root balls and then flush it with plain water about twice as much as the container so let's say that's a number five container I flush it with about five gallons to ten gallons of water and yes the the flush itself has been going on for just over two weeks it's been fifteen days since I started to flush get it a lot of really really nice necrotic leaf growth and yellowing now my biggest complaint with this plant was originally the frost production was nowhere near what the green love potion was and I would still argue the same thing I mean green love potion as a front as a frost monster but this one has really put on that that frost lately the smell itself has transformed a little bit I was getting like a bitter tangerine keel for the majority of the grow and it's transformed to be a little bit sweeter it's almost like like more of like an orange peel I guess I don't know if anyone out there has a lot of experience with testing different types of citrus fruits but I get more of a sweetness with an orange so I would say that this has kind of come and it's ended up with more of like of a sweeter orange peel rather than like a tangerine peel we will see though I have heard online from a couple of other growers of tangi that that is common they say that if pulled at about week nine you'll get a lot more of a turfy tangerine profile and if pulled more you know week ten and beyond you lose a little bit of that tur penis that like the bitter tangerine to a more sweet orange flavor so it seems to be pretty much on point with a lot of the other tangi fee nose that we've seen out there yeah they just love looking at these buds I mean it's not the unique calyx formation the frost is really packing on I mean that smell is it's pretty prevalent now it used to be very subtle but now once I open this tent it smells exactly like an orange in here so it's pretty prevalent now I'm finally I mean honestly like I don't know if you can tell but these buds are really really starting to pack on not quite fist-sized quite yet but I mean these these buds are all probably going to be good like five to seven grand buds at least I would love to have a good ten gram butt in there but honestly just with the way that I know things are gonna kind of shrink with it with the dry and all I don't think that's going to be about like a reality but yeah guys I'm gonna do what I always do to this lady remove all of the fan leaves that have no sugar on it I'm gonna chop it in segments just because I can't hang it all all up as one plant in my house give it about seven to 14 days just depending on humidity to it to fully dry and then we'll give it a nice close trim and give it a two-week cure when what's going on guys hope everyone out to have something decent they can dab on and something good they can sip on today on the dab and chug I will be sipping on a amber style avalanche by Breckenridge Brewing Company now I believe these guys were actually bought out by by anheuser-busch Budweiser pretty much I mean I am pretty anti Monsanto pretty anti-walmart pretty anti you know anheuser-busch but at the same time they are they're part of our lives and sometimes a necessary evil I'd like to make this comparison all the time I mean I do hate Monsanto but I also feel that it would be really really hard to support 8 billion people on this planet without certain things they've done so necessary evil sometimes guys not saying that you should support them or anything along those lines this saying loves to [ __ ] sometimes I deal with people we don't like - might as well make it as best we can but yes Breckenridge Brewing Company is a great Brewing Company based out of I believe it's metropolitan Denver they have some on point ales and some really really awesome specialty beers they have a nitrous pumpkin a latte stout that I'm insanely intrigued on trying beyond that though guys I actually have a bit of a different dab in check for you I was presented and offered to review and give an honest opinion of the new New York uh vape shops mini vaporizer pen I have a review of this coming out this Monday so keep an eye out for the full review but we'll go ahead and take our dab and chug with with this today New York vape shop awesome awesome representative through Greg contacted me I'll go ahead and throw their link down in the description so if you guys want to pick up any affordable and quality pens go ahead and check out their website and I'll actually be dabbing on some green love potion wax that I've made myself this last weekend if anyone actually wants a better view of the brews or the wax that I'll be smoking on I'm go ahead and go to Instagram and look me up as board or piss drunks is zero four two zero I'll throw up my Instagram link into the description as well ah but all right guys I'm kind of stuck in trim jail this is the end of all the video as I typically don't work there when I'm a little bit tipsy and stoned out of my mind so see how the rest of the night goes but enough ranting guys to all of my followers in the US and abroad like always Cheers salud Sante and Prost alright guys back to the flour room I hope everyone enjoyed the tangi harvest I just wanted to go over a couple of the upgrades I've made this time around the most obvious of which is going to be the grow tent I've been growing in a 4x4 by 7/10 for about two years now and this upgraded 5 by 10 by 7/10 is super nice we're not utilizing the entire space right now but I want to keep things perpetual so after these five plans here hit about four weeks of flour I'm gonna turn on my other Pro Series light and place a couple of Dark Dragon here I just want to keep harvests coming make sure I don't run an herb that's been way too common these days but beyond the grow tent which I'm very stoked about I finally received my Mars Pro at the star 320 LED I actually won this panel on the Mars hydro cup they hold competitions every now and again and offer either panels or other you know equipment for for prizes so major shout out to Mars hydro guys they have very affordable LEDs that work great a couple examples of other growers that use them are people like medgar or one mr. tights homegrown report KGB grow kid and even grow 420 Diaries so again these guys are really supportive of the community they have great products and affordable products as well to get started so yes anyone that's looking to get started into Mars hydro I would recommend their reflector or Mars 2 series very affordable and someone that's looking to invest a little bit more money in a piece of equipment it's gonna last a bit longer I would say the Mars pro series is the way to go a quick little rant about Mars hydro though really really happy with their service and their products and this is why I mean I have five flowering plants right here they're a little bit squished together just because they're in the first couple of days of flower but once they start really showing little buttons little like hairs and stuff like that calyx is protruding from there from their notes we'll go ahead and spread them out a little bit more and turn this Mars pro panel from veg only to bloom and to go over the plants this is the same as last round I have four different fee knows of the green love potion all around and I have the one tangi here in the middle I still do have some dark dragon going those clones were a little bit too small though so I'm going to kind of continue the pheno hunt with these with these ladies and then like I said we'll go ahead and place a couple of dark dragons here to see which would Fino of the dark dragon I'm going to be keeping now I have four of the Sam Serra seats like I told you guys this is green love potion number three and green love potion number one those the two that you guys saw flowered out really impressed with the frost reductions the quality of those buds now I have this Fino here which is phenotype number one much more indica style leaves grows pretty squat this is also the the biggest hermie I've ever seen in my life I don't know what happened to it but one day I came into the grow room turned the plant around and a whole side of this plant just was protruding a male pollen sacks so I'm gonna give this one more time around and see if if it was possibly a light leak or just something I may have done that caused that that hermie oh yes green love potion number one here and green love potion and number five over here this one I didn't flour out either because it was a mutated seed you can even still see now that the leaves are all wrinkled and just aren't growing right this one was mutated from seed so I was trying to give it a little bit more time in the veg but as that happened I switched nutrients for my veg plants and this this one took it really hard so the mother died I took a couple clones before I killed it and we're gonna fly with this one out see if it's worth keeping and you guys already saw the tangi actually earlier in this episode I was insanely impressed with the final frost production on it it was a bit of a slow slow to frost up strain but along with the unique smell unique calyx formation and the overall I think yield that I'm gonna get off this plant I am really considering keeping it in my garden I mean just really actually that's not the this is the tangi right here a really nice grower I expect it to be just towering over the other plants once it really starts stretching out the yeah guys that's really everything I had to go over in the garden not a whole lot happening and harvest just because these ladies just got moved in here but I have been doing some daily maintenance I just lollipop this earlier in the day sorry if the fans making the audio hard here about just lollipop these a couple of dirt earlier in the day today I'll be turning on the bloom spectrum soon guys so we should have more content for you but like

questions or just to say what's up and of course make sure you hit that subscribe button guys we'll see you next week", "aolN9WJ8Qeg": "[Music] now hey now we got a new product it's their farm-fresh featured Farms brand and the cool thing about this is they are featuring their favorite strains from their top cultivation partners so the grower there's one grower that's growing the strain and they are using it as their oil for their pen all right so what they've got on here on their website is it says that it offers high potency single source whole plant extracted cannabis oil with its original full-spectrum terpenes from the state's top growers so you ask what is single source oil it's an oil in which the terpenes and the cannabis concentrate come from the same plant each product in their featured farm line showcases a specific strain from one cannabis cultivator and that particular strain will always come from the farm featured on the box in other words your vape only has one ingredient high quality flour so enjoy enjoy enjoy so how is the featured Farms unique you asked it says using Rove's finely tuned Co T co2 extraction process they're able to capture the pure original turps from the farms top flour then rove extracts the oil carefully refines it using mild heat and centrifugation finally the original tube P terpenes and God I can't talk the original terpenes and pure golden oil are recombined in a cartridge specifically designed to highlight the flowers true and complex nature look at how beautiful the oil is it is very golden like the described and it tastes a lot different so what you're going to find if you if you use rove already you're gonna see that the the normal flavors the OG the cush they all have a hint of I mean if you smoke a bowl or whatever you're gonna see that it doesn't taste like what you're tasting so they put added terpenes they make a batch and they'll put different terpenes in to make it the flavor that it has that's how they can be so consistent these terpenes they don't use these obviously but this is what a terpene is and it just adds a flavor and the smell that makes it the product that you're getting so I don't know if I've explained it well or just confuse the [ __ ] out of you but featured farms it's a different product that rove is doing and it's more natural i would give it a try it tastes great and they only come in half grams and only from dispensary near you so give them a try today they're not bad really not bad i think you'll be impressed so thanks got any questions leave them down below and we will continue to keep you updated with rove and the products as they come out thank you for watching like and subscribe and hit that notification bell to get notified when I upload a new video I totally

who do the video and they're straight to be gone for today it's our tangi and i picked this up in health life out in mesa the Chrisman location this is Sarah tangi and this is my melting point extracts and from what I could find out sorry ten G's at 80/20 sativa dominant strain and the TCL's on this thing gives like twenty two percent so Zig had mediocre levels as far as a genetics goal this across the East Coast Sour Diesel and tan G so you got some good stuff in here by you got the sour DS or the Campbell or Northern Lights the California orange that's all in here and this is a very orange e strain man like you when he smelled the dabs she's got that orange citrus aroma to her there we go we've got this loaded up first today some sour tangi anyhow I really enjoyed medicating with this strain but there are some things might want to watch out for the munchies the munchies are in here brah and she's very relaxing for us at IVA dominant strain I don't know what it is I haven't been taking up I'm just been picking up sativas every time I go to the dispensary and it's not like I get to my purpose I look at what the deal is they got going and nice and I picked up like five sativas today there's outside people another five sativas so all i've been puffing on like sativas man i I don't know if I'm getting used to it or what but it seems like these cities are starting to get very relaxing man like some of them even kouchi and this one was kind of like that as well this got very catchy she gave me two munchies but you gotta have something to do you got to be like the wheels have got to be in motion you gotta have something to look forward to something but you're in the process of doing because if not at least for me I found myself just couching out came very very lazy and kouchi so anyhow let's uh get this party started brah cheers you guys it's our Itachi very orangey broadest one you could taste the orange flavor man Oh brah I did read some information about this train says she's good for depression exhaustion stress chronic and minor pain and I can see that she was good for that I was grinning anxiety it's just like social anxieties she is very relaxing for a sativa no she's very chilled and kind of I don't know easygoing I didn't feel I didn't feel nervous or jittery or anxious in any way or rushed so she was a good date I'm strange she didn't like if you're sitting this in the inner garage just poking this up by herself at least for me man I found myself getting very kouchi but when I was out doing something I found myself being kind of more a little bit more lively and and and with the and just going along with how things were just flowing you know but she was great for going out and doing stuff the only thing I really noticed about her was she had some strong munchies man like I was constantly like nothing was nothing was good enough nothing was satisfy me I was like this finger this deep hole they're just throwing stuff into it was she set the much stuff pretty hard but we were making food I was still eating what we were making food and like yeah so the strain does have the munchies she's a relaxing sativa but she's good on the anxiety wonderful on the chill we're at the crowded places like the mall great shot being things like that it's wonderful for those kinds of stuff would I grab it again mm maybe probably she's a good strain you know this is a good straight for your daytime stoning it's great for doing stuff during the daytime it I thought it didn't intoxicating or or anything like that I felt like it was kind of functional like I had no problem driving around I hiding up on talking to people I had no problem communicating or anything like that you know it didn't hinder me in any way so yeah this would be a good shame to go to work with to go to school is anyhow the strain is a bit of a creeper she takes a little while to get started mm-hmm but I feel like I'm not really buzzing nicely right now I've got a really nice internal buzz a feeling in the face we're on the eyes this whole area this region and house we've got one last dab here but I was gonna save this I was gonna chuck this in the rainy day pile but mmm I'll just blast him right now it's a small dab anyway so stuff is gorgeous brah mmm actually smells wonderful even when you're hitting it mm-hmm it's got that orange like orange peel looking like I don't know it does it's very orange e not like a candy orange but an actual like orange peel orange thing zest that's kind of how she you have kind of zestfully orange remember that's so obsessed zest fully clean that's all we can remember from our childhood how do you ever any of the books I read but I am rather commercials okay books to be had when we were six years old see big run see Jane ran I'm one other kid I think I was like kindergarten I just remember this man I gotta take the biggest trouble because I lost the book was like see Jane run one of those books and some kid turned it in gave it to my teacher my teacher she knew she had it she knew was my book that I had dropped along on my way home she's like grilling me make me feel like crap and everything and then afterwards then she's like good things so I'm so found it and I think about it man why would she even a teacher huh Frick it's not like you're like sick of kids but I guess that's all you can do going at Taco Bell or something man yeah some sour tangi some sour tangi you guys mm-hmm sour candy in the hole sour Tangie she is very orangey bra anyhow this is sour tangi and she's a wonderful strain bar she's stony she's uplifting she's great for depression the pain relief is good even the anxiety I didn't feel 80 jitters or panic or or anything that I would expect from a sativa like at 80 20 heavy sativa heavy sativa anything above 70 or 75 should be I think it's probably she beating the heavy range but this is very relaxing for a sativa dominant strain at least for me and how I feel my experience you know she's just pretty mellow she's super chill but she does have the munchies and she can't get kouchi but if the wheels are in motion if you guys are doing something or you're about to go do something you're puffing on the strain and you have like I guess intentions you know desires to go out and do something you're ready you know it's planned you'll be feeling really wonderful she's good social smoke and I did puff this while my brother was here in fact this is what we puffed off when we made meat pies I remember cuz I read about the suntan G and I was like this sounds like a really restrain and I've had this dream before I looked around didn't see on a string of you but I do remember having this and so I took this up before we went and made meat pies Oh Frick the whole time we're making meat pies but I was grabbing all kind stuff that evidence of pretzels has a little Japanese crackers those rice cake cracker things I was a grater out even cheese's use curl people when the meat was done I think we can take little bits and bytes of that stuff like the munchies hit me hard with the strain but yeah she's fun for that kind of stuff mmm what we was kicking I was having a blast laughing joking talking story so she could be a very fun social smoke but at the same time she could must be very relaxed and super chill I did enjoy going out and doing stuff even just going to the gas station grabbing drinks of my viola that was fun you know having a blast with the Krispy Kreme this lady with wearing my shirts I made a gorilla glue shot list my brother and I was wearing a train wreck and we walk into Krispy Kreme and with the creepy croupe Lenny time for I think I started to think like it hey Google is there a Krispy Kreme in New Zealand there's one in Auckland we let it hit one up in like two or three times man I was like sugar Alba like I'm on a sugar fast right now look just serving everything but I would drinking lemon water I used to stick it in my I know I hit my fruits with sugar but refined processed sugar this isn't even about that isn't about me it's about forgetting salat angie was trained my experience with it anyways give it a mind she's freaking made me all like happy had a blast my braless me frickin mincemeat pies figure mincemeat pies taste so friggin good us blast off this trade even right now feel nice and toasty and miss my brothers man you need somebody to burn with besides myself anyhow you know but I don't know I would consider deception or straight like this they would make you not to be deceiving but more I guess your walls are down you know your defenses you're not so guarding of yourself you're more ounces kind of like be opening and everything with everybody because when photos of us who have been through certain situations they may have traumatize us or cause us to kind of clam up close up you know it's more of a protection guarding thing that is trying to late press try to swing us gather us some money you know there's nothing like that there's no evil intentions all the intentions are are good for the greater good of for us yes every this is a long video and I don't know that's just how this train is eating this ramble on she's good for talking story abroad she was good for listening and absorbing knowledge watching documentaries going out hiking would be a good one anyways um anyways I gotta get going or else's Bill's gonna go on forever bra so yeah sorry tangi she's a blue straight man", "pvlDamCXRmo": "so guys I got a four grams our tangi and the big

judge that will see how it makes me feel uh let's get into her here potency analysis CBD CBD a CBN all zeros THC 0.288 THC a 18 point 2 5 9 c BD v th cv zeros CB g 0.285 CB g a 0.221 cd8 t HC 0 CB c 0.04 one for a total of nineteen point o95 terpenes limonene 0.378 beta car point two nine six beta murse point two eight nine oh it's just a few days after Valentine's Day this was packaged February 4th so it is fresh ladies and gentlemen I've got a clean rig everything's been freshly flushed and clean so I can enjoy the flavors and yeah oh yeah throw that in the garbage so I'm not making a mess of my room pissing off the missus any more than I already do with my shenanigans now let's crack into it shall we okay right on top is the boost pack nice keep on there Oh ooh I love that smell sour tangi you get the diesel funk you get the tangi citrus nice nice nice happy little trees happy little trees red hairs sugary oh the citrus I mean the diesels there too but the citrus is very strong with this batch yeah there's half a tree there there's little friends I know I'm being weird but its first thing in the morning so and i'm unmedicated so I'm gonna be weird that's just the way it is people way it is any of you ever get a chance to stretch with me it's just a warning I get strange in the morning sleep it out my medicine I'm excited for this I like my sativas for daytime use especially if I have a long week or a lot of [ __ ] to do during the day and today is one of those days I will be driving two hours everyday on top of my normal commute for the rest of this week to cover for a guy who will be out for a week visiting a friend who is failing health so yes it doesn't add any extra hours I don't get any extra overtime or anything like that it just means I'll be doing something different for my work instead of my usual routine no the only good part of it is other than getting me out of the building for most of the day is that it will afford me a couple opportunities such as well for starters being able to get things to eat that aren't available nearby for me we have a pretty limited selection we're a small town both towns nearby are pretty small so we only have a couple of fast-food places and it's weird I know it's stupid but we get excited over stupid [ __ ] sometimes it just takes a you know sometimes it's Taco Bell yeah so um you know Burger King things that you normally like an hour away from me so I'll actually be down there everyday so I can get a chance to you know switch up Cheers very smooth the first thing I tasted was the diesel it's pretty strong actually the East Coast Sour Diesel taste is pretty strong so I had more citrus aroma but more diesel flavor for what it's worth very nice though hello bit of earthy taste to it I like it it's a nice flavor let's say it's a pretty good profile flavor profile sour tan geez this is it's good stuff folks good stuff I mean I love my indicas absolutely love my indicas I need them every night to unwind to sleep I love a good hybrid primarily during the day I like good hybrid a little bit of both best of both worlds right but sometimes you just need that straight sativa this is not it this is a really nice hybrid but it is sativa dominant so if you still you want a hybrid you want a little bit of that indica but you need a good sativa at the same time Sour tangi folks it's our taste little citrus on that one almost like a grapefruit it was kind of cool hell yes hell yes so this is a good flower and it was if I remember correctly it was $42 for the8 $42 was a little cheaper for me got a discount but $42 $42.00 and the quality is there the trim jobs nice the buds are quality the jars full a moisture pack I mean it's just no no no throat burn it's it's very very smooth it's just nice it's got a great flavor we'll know in a few minutes how the effects are but I'm already starting to feel pretty decent I mean we're only coming up on ten minutes here and I haven't been medicating for the whole thing I'm starting to feel pretty decent for the morning not a bad way to wake up and start your day get my sour tangi and my coffee oh we have you a great day yes so those are you know on a statement to things I rely on every day my coffee in the morning I don't do it all day long I don't drink coffee throughout the day all day six ten eight twelve a pot whatever I used to full disclosure I used to but now on the occasion I have a coffee I have one maybe two in the morning with my medical cannabis and that's it I do drink caffeine not gonna lie I drink soda trying to cut back on that and not just because of the caffeine but because of all the sugar and the other crap that's in there it's just horrible for you that's why I'm so chubby it's like I mean I eat pretty healthy is it's the soda and crap that I eat there drinking put my body that's not good so I am trying I am trying to cut back on that and eventually cut it all out as I used to because when I wasn't drinking at crap I weighed about 50 pounds less than was a whole lot happier and a whole lot healthier not to mention every case of soda I buys like 10% of a gram oil so wasting money that I could be spending on my medicine on junk food and that's no different than people who smoke cigarettes and then you know [ __ ] about not having any money because I and I can say that I used to be a smoker I gave it up eight years ago um yeah you're just blowing money down the drain I have a friend who smokes three packs a day of the expensive cigarettes they're like seven bucks a pack and he's blowing through 21 bucks a day on cigarettes and then he [ __ ] that he has no money at the end of the week when he wants to buy medication you just blew a hundred and eighty dollars or more on cigarettes how much medicine can you buy with $180 if you're not smoking cigarettes or eating it McDonald's or buying Mountain Dew or buying Monster energies and Red Bulls or you know other poisons and crap you put in your body and yes I still eat out and I will I know I'm turning this into a stupid lecture who the hell am I to lecture anybody on health I'm fat but yeah well I'm not fat but I'm out of ammo out of shape I'm overweight so but I am making an effort and that's the important thing making an effort to do better to live better to live cleaner and for no other reason I mean yeah for myself because I want to be healthier be better a little bit but I want to be there for my kids you know what I mean I don't want to be that dad as you know 40 years old and I can't play with my kids cuz I'm too fat and I'm gonna have a heart attack and die I'm only 35 folks I got a baby that's gonna be 2 and I got a girl it's about to be you know 12 this year I still have a lot of time to be playing with my kids and spending time with them doing fun things you know what I mean so for what it's worth take care of yourselves yeah I think it's definitely safe to say this is a good stuff the effects are definitely there I'm rambling a little bit as you could tell I feel good you definitely got that sativa buzz and I was looking for for the morning but yeah so I'm gonna call this one a

this road for you today I got this sativa tangi forgot my pants I was working on my car earlier so I gotten kind of dirty but it's fine first off right off the bat I gotta say this is a nice looking car it's a really cool looking I like the black chrome I like the you know little row of emblems on it I do have to say that this chamber looks a little small I don't think it's as large as the pure vape karts you know point five but it does taste really good I've been hitting this for a little bit now I feel really nice and high I don't feel like overly you know active I don't have like any like weird anxiety or anything from the sativa it's a good feeling I do have to say it's not quite as strong as like a przemek an sativa but it does keep me up a little bitter so that's good I would say it's a little bit stronger than the pure like jack hair this would be a little stronger than that but again you know the tube in here is really big and I just feel like this does not have as much liquid as some other point fives I would say it probably has about as much as the Prima can does so I mean it's no big deal but it tastes really good so I feel like that makes up for it Oh Rose I am gonna have to give them a thumbs up right now I'm feeling really good you know it's worth it if you can get these for 30 bucks that's a good deal I wouldn't go too much higher than that so I mean yeah it's a good good company pros you know nice and strong you know tastes really good Kahn's feel like there's not a lot of liquid in there and they're a little pricey but other than that you know go for

"3yKfqqmxbCw": "monomyth this club is important to me and if I did it and it could be very big for my design business okay you don't think I can control us", "avLIFvsaw4o": "[Music] [Music] what up guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another stray interview today we are checking out a cross between two strains that we reviewed individually actually super recently I didn't say within the last five reviews probably yeah we've got the biscotti crust with the gushers white connected this stuff is so fireman so a little bit about how I picked this up I actually just went down a family vacation down to Disneyland and I ran out of weed on the first day classic right [ __ ] classic Funkmaster done another four so started panicking about seven o'clock and I was like damn I had this homie that hit me on IG but said he wasn't free till about nine o'clock yeah this stuff looks crazy both structures insane anyways I'll make it short and sweet got the stuff from connected in Santa Ana look through about eight strains on the show which we're all pretty decent and this was the last one she pulled out and one word that I want you guys to really look for and when he bud tenders are talking is fresh she said I got this fresh new batch of biscotti gushers and I said I want to see that she pulled it out I gave it one whiff and you know what fresh weed smells like I said I'll take four of those no when it's fresh you know - fresh yeah it wouldn't be the CCC if we actually remembered the extra no definitely wouldn't I didn't even get this joint lit so it's all good we're stumbling out the gates on this biscotti gushers but we're about to get real lit with you guys and go into a little strain revision so you showed me this stuff yesterday and right away I really wanted to smoke some we held off until today had a lot of [ __ ] to do this morning and I was able to come back here and finally get the close-ups on this stuff so I'm really excited to finally be able to get my hands and break into it a little bit mm-hmm I gotta say one of the two best strain reviews that we've done in the past couple months I would say is definitely the biscotti by itself and the gushers and after taking a pull off this the combination is amazing too I mean it tastes they literally taste like they [ __ ] each other so of the first two that we reviewed the biscotti and then the gusher so the biscotti was also from connected and the gushers was from big Smoky farms right which of those two did you like better wait Cushie gushers was from crisper breakfast or fish for breakfast is the one who bred the gusher stream but the backs that we got was from big Smoky farms yes I'm sorry okay and then was the next question which one did you like better Scotty or the gushing I personally like the gushers better yeah see I actually like the biscotti better but I did like both both were really fire so when I first thing when we cracked this when I open these jars I wanted to see which way this was gonna be leaning heavier which characteristics I was gonna find first I know based off the look I see more of the biscotti look on this one yeah the look okay but on the smell mm-hmm I get gushers which is honestly what I look for in a cross if I wanna cross two of my favorite strains I want to get the look of one and the smell of the other most of the time right most of the time that's what you're looking for so this is honestly a great cross by connected here it's got that sweeter fruity more than the gushers I'd say well I'd say that is the overpowering one but there's a little bit of that gelato in there too which to me I've never really been able to differentiate between the scottie and just other really good gelato you know right for the most part it's it's pretty much the same turf profile and high at least for my palate and I'm definitely getting a little bit of both in there but like you said I think it leans on the smell a little bit heavier towards the gusher side looks a little bit more the biscotti side how does it smoke in the joint Europe in yin um you know I was I'm gonna keep it 100 I was expecting a little bit more flavor to punch through and I'm not getting it I'm hoping it comes through on the bomb it definitely tastes good do not get me wrong I'm not hating here but you know and it definitely did get me high though I'm definitely kind of rambling a little bit not rambling but like it's hard to like put my sentences together a little bit that effective that one in there yeah it's got me very like cerebral very high very inside my own head it's like tough to put sentences together I'm gonna go and hit this bomb and see how it tastes it tastes really good out of the bomb I'm gonna tell you right now this one is bong weed in my opinion you know I take this joint maybe just a little bit tighter than we would normally roll on yeah or at least that's how it's smoking this stuff's super sticky so not gonna it's crazy sticky you gotta roll it a little bit looser you know that tastes a lot better out of a bomb it took me a while to get that lit so I did roll that a little too tight I apologize maybe that is docking it a little bit on the flavor maybe once it gets gonna get a little bit more flavor but out of bong tastes pretty good that's up there man I mean this stuff is really good like I said I'm not trying to hate on it by any means I'm just giving my honest opinion definitely taste is better out of the bong like you said I think this is bong we let me go ahead and hit the joint one more time a couple more times so basically for me this is just really interesting because it's super rare that we get to you know not necessarily smoke a strain but like when we do a review we sit down and we really kind of lock into a strain or maybe pay more attention than we normally would just smoking at casually right so being able to sit down and review the gushers and then review the biscotti really close together like that was within the last month and a half yeah I would definitely say so yeah and then to have this right here is just super interesting to see the cross on I don't remember the exact ratings that we gave the other ones I know the but I think the biscotti was a 10 if it wasn't a 10 it was like a Niner 9.5 and then I think I gave the gushers just a slightly lower rating like an 8 or 9 okay I totally forget you know if you guys want to know more about these strengths individually the gushers and the biscotti you can go ahead and click that info card right up there but yeah across on this honestly is amazing you know very good characteristics and like I said it's fresh and you know I don't think it's gonna pass a stick factor just because it had a great little sticky note sticking to the table more than my fingers yeah no it's definitely sticky so this is this is another one of those bugs right that's gonna have more of the insect expected yeah so outside of the bud still pretty sticky but inside of the bud you could stay there all day that'll stay there for a while you know so I think this stuff definitely fresh as you said but I think jarred at the perfect time because you bought this what four or five days ago yes yep no I think it is perfect like I said man when the bud tender like I looked at like eight strains and I was like yeah it's cool but you know I'm gonna keep it real for the price you know sixty five dollars or something like that out the door you know I was like kind of cringing a little bit and then she pulled this out and I was like you know I would gladly pay that for this you got this at the connected store I did so I've never been there what's their store like experience honestly they're building out the front of it right now and the front of it looks super nice but I had to go in through like this side door and you know it was nice but you know it wasn't nothing spectacular but they are building out the huge front and if you want if you go there you'll know what I'm talking about and it looked nice honestly that they had really nice staff did branding and good flower if they had the alien labs I picked up the gelato 41 - it's already gone I believe to that before I even got homeless it was so far but yeah I mean good staff you know pretty store and I'm sure when they opened up the front it's gonna be dope Connie goes to a point that we were talking about a few weeks ago - how like you brought home a bunch of fire flavors I think all of them had some version of gelato and them in one way or another oh yeah like I said man gelato is the new new family favorite these days it's just getting bored out but you know it's not a bad thing it's fire though it is it really is gelato is fire man the 41:33 25 one thing I have noticed is some of the gelato I would not say this stuff from connected none of the stuff from connected I've seen but some of the other stuff I guess more some of the black market gelato that I've seen that does look and smell like gelato for the most part some of it tends to be a little bit unstable genetics oh yeah like you do see kind of some of those little half forms see the previous lines yeah like no super white seeds yeah I mean you're gonna see that it's just like these some of these genetics haven't been stabilized I haven't found any in these jars yet but you will find it in like some Street gelato I've seen it in dispensary weed and black market weeded this way and it just seems like you know maybe not every Fino of it is super stable you know I'm not sure where everyone is getting their cuts that they're doing for a lot of this yeah oh that's what I'm talking about it tastes good through the joint the bomb is what gets you that crunch to the head yeah I'm not digging this joint my bed mmm you can't wait a mall I'm curious if it what if it's really good Bobby there is not a particular joint it's definitely bong weed and it's probably that should he join that I'm telling you I'm gonna put these on blast right now I don't like these stuffable combs by raw or any stuffable harmful blow your own I'm going back to roll my own I gave these a shot maybe there's someone out there maybe you guys like them I don't well we got that Fox for free of those 50 packs or the 50 pack gives three cones so we've been using them for the videos lately you don't like them dude I feel like they if you grind up the weed they usually work better you know it's they smoke like [ __ ] if you break it up by hand and stickier weed like this just doesn't yeah [ __ ] that no no smash away if you roll your own I'm gonna roll my own from now on as far as raiding this stuff I'm gonna go I'm gonna lead off with buzz I think it's pretty obvious to you guys if you guys watch all of our videos we're a lot higher I know and I'm super high this shit's hitting at 27 percent THC that's that's that's that's a lot and I'm definitely scrambled like I said it's hard to put sentences together so I'm gonna say the best feature of this sweetest is the buzz I'm gonna give it a 10 yeah I like the buzz I like the so buzz I'm gonna give 10 I'm just gonna bang it out like this it was 10 flavored 9 look eight and a half only because there's some of these buds that are not trimmed up as well as some of these prime knows I'm not about 50/50 in my jar over here not knocking on anything yet and what else is there smell [ __ ] I could give the smell like at nine and a half so I don't know what that averages out to but this feels like a solid nine to me mine okay that's a very solid rating I like the pure biscotti a little bit better I like this definitely better than the gusher I'm gonna take it right now I'm gonna take my rating to the 10th scale you guys will see it on me in a second but so the two best features is this weed is the high at a 10 and I'm gonna give the smell of 10 as well but there are a few flaws like he said the trim job and I think he could be a little stickier for how fresh it is even though it is pretty gummy I like my wing just a little more stickier and I'm being super critical guys like connectives killing it they're one of the hottest brands out right now smoke super clean to the smoke super clean it tastes clean it's got good expansion but it doesn't make you cough too much it's literally super fireweed to sum up I got 10 on the high 10 on the looks I got and I'm sorry 10 on the high 10 on the smell 8.5 on the looks and I'm gonna give it overall nine point two nine point two nine point two you heard it here first guys boom definitely impressed with the quality of all the stuff that we've been seeing from connected especially over the last six months or so in a time where you've seen in my opinion a lot of other brands who had sustained good reputations for quality and consistency a lot of them have taken a little bit of a dip in the last six months and I feel like connected has kept steady or maybe taken a step up slight step pro at least with the stuff that I've seen you know all the stuff that we've reviewed from them on the show has been really good all the stuff that you know we tried that we hasn't made its way to you know you yet it all gives me really not like this I'm super high and I think that doesn't for another streamer VGA for the CCC I'm Danny and I am Shane we'll be back with more great gang do your thing do you think we have this mofo with some paint doubt cuz smoking penetrate so sticky Yoji smelling breaks and swiping on the best to alleviate distress so he gets to the chest wooden roaches the rest", "ysqDpG46T7g": "what I what up y'all it's your boy row row coming in raw we got rolled bread in the house run to the event last week for 4/20 and it was a blessing so my objective is to get every flavor and every strain up on my channel for you guys to be able to know more about the strains right now we have a new flavor alert from Rove we got tangi tangi so bomb man is good for the daytime I'm not really a sativa guy but when Rove comes with the sativa I become a sativa guy all right I'm gonna reaching right here in this booklet the information on tangi you're for your happiness and relaxation these are the states that will slowly inundate your senses the strain has long has strong feel-good powers that tingle and motivate let your spirit fizzle and your creativity pop as 10g hits home with sweet citrus notes bringing out your vibrant side color every moment with 10g that's rose X description on tangi now let's get to it alright so it's nothing better than a great packaging from a company so as you can see rove you just slide it right here and you get it right open man my recommendation is once you take it out of the package this black rubber part on the top make sure that you take this black part and you throw it away don't keep applying it back on to the cart cuz you'll push it down and you'll end up smashing the coil inside the battery so don't do it just take the top off throw it away now you can see in the technology of this cart there's airflow holes up top that's used to prime it and open up the airflow every time because as you can see the actual concentrate doesn't move because there's no real like solvents added to it it's actually solving this okay so I'm gonna take you guys through both batteries here's the stick battery and here's the Rove mod we'll start off simple with the stick battery the way it goes is pretty simple you do the five clicks one two three four five or one two three four five you're gonna do it kind of fast that turns it on then once you actually applied the cartridge to the battery make sure you don't screw it on there too tight and make sure it's not too loose there's a little plate right at the bottom of this battery if you screw it too tight you'll push the plate down and smash the coil okay so you want to apply this screw it on there and you can tell when it's on there good enough because Rove is using a battery that is very compatible with their cartridge okay let you have it on to your battery you want to hit the button twice that turns it all the way blue and that provides you with the preheat mode which is going to turn the concentrate into more of a honey like a honey-like consistency which will make it a lot easier to bait this is a new upgrade that Rove has done with their battery that I really appreciate because I used to use lighters and torches and stuff to try to warm it up but now you get the technology to provide that for you which is amazing it can run your battery a little faster and drain it but I would suggest you pick up two batteries and have run for a backup that's how I do it but as you can see it's starting to get warm and honey like so now the preheat mode is over okay after you preheat it you want to prime it and the way you prime it is you push the button and you exhale into the cartridge these airflow holes up top we'll blow out some of the vape and that's how you know your air flow has been open like this that is evidence that your air flow is open okay now tangey is amazing I've been a medicating on it for the last couple days just a little bit just so I can try it myself it is a new flavor and it does have some relaxation entities to it which is amazing very few sativas have any type of relaxation medical effects which I really need to be able to relax as well as feel that exciting energy and creativity that the sativa provides okay so we're ready to go as you can see it's nice and honey-like now alrighty let's go ahead and test out tangi please leave down in the comments what you think about tangi when you had a chance to try it I'd love to know first like sativa roll hit of the day to see how it goes Wow for a Tenjin super-potent okay so everybody yeah other people do like different categories and stuff I keep a real simple because I'm coming in wrong no edits no thumbnails none of that you check it out the flavor is ridiculous it tastes like I just now bit into a cutie you know a little minute those little tiny oranges but this is more like a Tang the ring taste I'm dealing with here and it is amazing right now I'm feeling some high in my face which is normally from a sativa strange nose is kind of starting to run run a little bit and I do feel like a slight relaxation little nerves popping off in my legs as far as so that's the taste effectiveness is right away price point is amazing [Music] check out Rove brand calm Rove brand.com all strains are all strains are

not too much we gonna pull Polly yeah Oh Polly again where our we got this stuff off the interwebs so you know a local producer we're doing sour tangi again we've done this it was I think our second or third review second or third yeah 10 SLC a review now we have a black market yeah exactly so we're doing this off of the the craft side of the cannabis industry so we'll see how this goes I remember the the NSL seat Angie was very good and super dry yeah super dry of course but you know that's that's part and parcel with everything you get from the NSL see these days at least worried about this stuff a few days ago it was not as dry it felt a lot better cured when I originally got it yeah this stuff is well I mean like you can kind of you can feel the difference for sure yeah like I'm just sitting here breaking it up with my hands you can you know you can feel the moisture already but and if you were looking to pick this up and you're in the HRM like green star on weed maps could probably send you some of this yeah yeah it's definitely something you can order online you know or you can get it at the NSL see but you know we're checking it out just uh well it's been a while since we did the other one so I don't know what kind of comparison we're gonna be able to draw but you know well see what happens anyway and it's true remember in a week-to-week is even hard it's true yeah I mean you know we need a little novel with tasting notes like [ __ ] wine stops yeah yeah exactly did you know marijuana affects your short-term memory I think could be it did you know marijuana affects your short no I remembered having a really nice orange taste yeah yeah nice citrusy flavor very potent from what I recall even just for a 15% the sour tangi is a sativa hybrid so it's 80% to Teva 20% indica so I like that little bit of Endicott I think yeah your celebs aren't my favorite usually it makes a it makes a difference for sure like I find a high you get from the from the hybrids is quite a bit different than the the regular sativa and you know even the regular into coke which just really might go to the studio four percent twenty percent like and because it's just like to put me into a chair and have a nap and yeah I've actually hit the NSF see a few times recently just on off-chance where you know I didn't have anything on me and I was out and I figured well I'm as well hit the store just to have something and I've tried the well stuff that we'll review in time but the Hyland's all cush I don't think we've reviewed that yeah yeah no yeah Highlands well Cape Breton or up around any knish but okay present no no Antigonish is more halfway between here in Cape Breton or well not halfway between here and Cape right that's more halfway between here and Sydney but it takes about two hours to drive to Antigonish and then there's another two-hour well another hour hour and a half to the causeway I think alright mmm I have made the trip that often I've been down to the the island a few times but yeah yeah you're right I can't describe that I know what I do remember about the orange taste on the sour Tanja's on my vape bags that left a very odd like lingering taste that was not enjoyable probably do the same inside pipe and like yeah so great joint weed but was not my favorite in my vape because of the orange residue it just wasn't Pleasant you know three bowls later yeah yeah that's I can see that would get old after it went off for sure but we high itself I'm up for being awesome yes yes the high was very nice we didn't do the the 20 minute later like we do now but yeah I was as I recall it was a good potent and consistent high you know I just watched the video before I came down to use alright yeah it helps to refresh yeah I just got off work yeah exactly yeah old Facebook is gonna try its new battle on terrorism by blocking white nationalism I think it is is the headline I just read oh good luck yeah good luck you know Trump's Trump's kind of pushing that agenda I guess so you know we'll see how he does apparently the molar report came out and there was no real hard evidence about collusion with the Russians but you know whatever it's not important he was never gonna get impeached anyway no no exactly it's orange like a peach yeah we need to get one with Velcro or a little like chain well I used to carry a lighter on me all the time and now for some reason I don't okay don't have them at these three here yes exactly now let's have the first impressions are you gonna stop that nice like orange taste yeah it's not bad it's not Aslam it's not a strong flavor like it's not definitely not as orange II as the government stuff No I can taste a bit of the citrus but not like it's not overwhelming like it was well not overwhelming but you know like it's not as as prevalent definitely not as plentiful in their soul more of almost like a lingering like thought of a taste and not like here's the taste yeah and then similar to our Sunday morning I'd least for myself haven't smoked in hours because I was a worm so I haven't smoked all day yeah so basically didn't it yeah I did get the vaporizer or I got a vaporizer just recently from Arizer called the solo2 and I've used it a couple times it is an excellent vaporizer are they still running that same pro more yeah I think they perhaps yeah I mean I got the solo too and they sent me if a free vaporizer or the original air from ERISA which is also a very good vaporizer from what I've been told I haven't tried it myself yet but a nice user extreme cube for years and rehabs or a popular company but it's awesome is that I think the volcano does what just takes a little longer and I've actually I've actually checked well I mean I checked out a couple of walkthrough videos for it too cuz you know I'd rather do that and read the instructions of course because much easier everything you can find on YouTube what type of temperatures are people saying about that Oh between 190 and do 10 nice - seven - or five three years we've never looked it up thanks yeah they say for the for the solo - which I purchased they say 190 or one of the videos I watched on outside about 190 is that is an ideal temperature and I've been finding that's pretty good yeah alright one done you probably got more flavor in less paper yeah well I mean there's there's different ways to pack it as well liking impact Bowl after you after you bust up the weed but there's you know liking also chest take a small bud and put it in and that's you know like that's a good way to retain better flavor when you're when you're baby when you're using your base as well samwell's assumed it was a surface area factor where I've really busted my knot pretty good to get as much air flow about the plant materials if that makes sense like I would think the same thing actually yeah but no apparently if you don't bust it up you get the better flavor so let's flavor in this for sure but like nice like a head high for immediate I'm not getting it quite yet I got a few little tingles but yeah I don't know as I recall I think the other one waited what's wrong yeah yeah this is a good Pleasant high but it's not it's not an overwhelming high and like it's not you know smack you down kinda nah no it's a nice you know get you started in the morning kind of just that sort of the city but it's not your 6 o'clock weed yeah that's nice you know you want to have a nice relaxing morning and said read the paper cup of coffee do people still read the paper I don't think people great favorite I think Google just pushes like push notifications to them reach Facebook oh wait let's check out your snapchat I don't know I don't know what the kids are on these days tick-tock the kids are on tick-tock tick-tock all right check out your tick-tock that's out right and you know tick-tock there's not a clue it's got a hundred million downloads Wow Oh hundred million people know about it and I don't this is the kids Ron did hear about musically before tick tock bottom it was it was musically now music ly music ly I think I may have seen the spelling at some point somewhere but sort of like vine used to be where like kids are on they're making like little videos a lot of them are just like spoof in music videos so they're like here's the song what they're like you know karaoke and and dancing watched a dude who was must have been like pretty big because was just like here's a guy one kid one of our stars yeah it's like doing sort of prank videos similar to just for lifestyle like alright so it's super short like 30 second clips but it's super funny like something wrong so like well I guess across between just for laughs and bone that was this one person yeah all right so the just people just give people deform yeah yeah um where the parents are yeah cuz a lot of buddy everybody's parents on Facebook exactly yeah which is why snapchat got cool yeah and then once and inspire kids on snapchat start having kids they'll have grandbabies and the parents left you on snapchat see the pictures of the grandbabies yeah I think the cherry fell onto my floor but that's pretty much done all right well so we'll be back in 20 minutes that's all right right now well let you now see if it gets any stronger and you know well let's see what happens all right thank you welcome back and so with a further review of the Sarat Angie what do you think I think it would be better than the government stuff for not leaving the orange residue and secured better yet stop dude get me higher yeah for sure shopkin it and better flavor I found as well the orange flavor yeah yeah so I'm so happy with it very high but absolutely the government's our tan genus are very different yeah yeah and it's shockingly um still high scores of eight and a half or nine for sure I'd be happily happily smoke this again absolutely it black market or white mark good I guess it is yes sir or mainstream or the sour Sanji's a fan tiny little crab marine starter stuff like it won't it's very different from the government's yeah definitely definitely but still a really good high for sure very how do you have", "sG_YdB2ctW0": "make some noise for DNA genetics show strain we brought out was tangi it kind of took the world by storm I guess for the help of DNA genetics putting it out there and you know that's what kind of what we got famous for is our flagship I'm Crockett from Crockett family farms and I'm from California and we've been breeding seeds now for a few years with the help of some of our friends from DNA genetics even my grandfather you know grew you'd not took not to make a living or anything but you know they've all grown and and I kind of was born into it I have been growing my whole life since I could since I was early teens and I was able to actually do it and I've been fortunate to be able to to take it this far really I guess the first time I can Rhett remember remember remember marijuana would be smelling it as a good smelling it and it reminded me of my parents you know if if I was being they dropped me off for a while or something and I came back home and I smelt it I would know that they were like eight or nine years old like please good the first time I ever smoked marijuana I was 11 or 12 years old and my cousins and and everybody you know we're smoking it and I smoked until I did not I did I did not roll the joint myself but I did hit it and I did feel it some people say you don't feel it on the first time and that was not the case with me I got really really really high and I loved it right off the bat and I've been smoking it ever since no I can't remember what strain it was but it definitely was good it was some stuff that was coming off our mountain it was probably something back in the day in the late 80s that was probably cold like they had weird names back then it was probably called like like it was probably called still the big thing on our Mountain back then was like the stinger mark Haskell Smith the author of a whole bunch of different books one of them being the heart of dankness I met him while he was actually flying to Amsterdam to do research on his book I met him on the plane and I he said that he was going to be meeting up with the guy from DNA genetics and he was nice enough to introduce me my favorite type of strain I guess would be a sativa dominant hybrid I like them for a lot of different reasons I like I'm a terpene guy I like I like flavorful weed I like stuff that you can smell from across the room stuff that you can smoke and then an hour later your friends come in and know what you've been smoking you know tends to be for me sativa dominant hybrids I like the fact that you can grow them big outside and they still bring them in you know on a on a decent you know in a decent time before it gets too late in the fall they yield well inside now it easy to grow I just really dig them I like everything new I like I think it all I think Crockett family farms has a lot to look forward to in the future we have you know a good stable of strains out that are really hitting hard this year I think I'm not exactly sure but I know at least four of the strains that we released in the past year we've only been out to the public for a year and I think four of them four or five of them have already won different awards from different contests from different people all over the place people I don't even know you know and that's it's really cool to look back or to to know that's happening so I'm really excited for the future for the strains that we have out and you know we're working on a lot of really really cool stuff for the future too I've grown a lot of DNA genetics varieties through my life you know I could name off a whole lot I guess one of the biggest producers and this is a true story would be LA woman la woman was a seed some seeds that I had purchased and grown out in California before I even met a DNA and did pretty well with those made me a fan right away the first seeds I ever bought I was a young man and I just got him out of high school and I took the bus up to Vancouver BC British Columbia and went over there to this place called a respectable joint and and I was looking for seeds around there somewhere and I got directed to go find some where to go to purchase these seeds and I I went up there and purchased the seeds and it was Northern Lights number five times Hawaiian indica and Northern Lights number five times blueberry for the two packs I think I bought and I went back it down into this place to smoke a joint and I noticed that there was nobody in there but my friend and there was a guy outside making a speech and so I walked outside and I was just blanking him on his on his right shoulder there right behind him and then I noticed there was tons of cameras and media and people and stuff and he was waving his arms in the air and making this really passionate activist you know pro-marijuana Act of the speech and it was Marc Emery and Ed it was his shop and I was standing right behind him like I was one of his goons or something just fell right into it it was funny but that was the first time I ever bought seeds we've been winning with tangi since 2012 it's been around since before then but that's pretty much been it got released by DNA answer and we thought it was good enough to win a cup and it did when a third place actually but it's furred off this this huge movement with a citrus flavored aroma and taste especially in concentrates in the big view concentrate game it's just really taken a name for itself the the flavor and the smell are hard to duplicate and imitate but it's funny that a lot of people have tried that I've seen a whole gamut of different orange this and and tangi that or this you know all over the board and I really I feel fortunate that that's happening because you know I mean M&S yeah thank you that's exactly what I was going to say you know I mean I I never thought that I would be able to to create and be involved in creating a game changer like this before this sativas were dominated by the haze and and now we've got a little different flavor coming in you know we've got these fruit flavors that we can we can put around and not have a DA haze dominant you know flavor and growth pattern and all that so the other been a lot of people trying to knock it off and and you know it's it's something that that is fine I mean once people buy seeds and they decide to breed with them that's you know it actually makes me feel good and another thing that makes me feel good is now I go to these competitions and I see that that sometimes fifty percent are dominated by by tangi and different especially if me and Aaron are there together or me and Aaron or Don they're together we can look up on the thing and fifty percent of the entries are dominated by DNA and Crocket family farms", "2KAQWdnfp50": "guys remember make sure you hit that subscribe button sour tangy from stizzy oh it's a sativa premium thc pod came from aether gardens on colorado there's all the stuff on it

perfect manicure job definitely some good looking budge right here alright well let's go and get into the small test a test and this high test of this tangent so the small test of this tangi right here gets a 5 out of 5 it smells like some earthy tangerines or even some grapefruit with a little hint of sweet skunk but you could Duffy small it's like tangerines or some kind of a grapefruit but it definitely has that smell - it's very earthy very strong very loud package definitely smells amazing so five out of five for the smell test on this tangi right greens taste test five out of five tastes exactly the same way it smells there's the kind of grapefruit tangerine taste it's like earthy but it's also a little sweet because it is like I said that great food type taste with a little hint of sweet skunk definitely very strong very long-lasting on the palate so a five out of five for the Greens taste that I've trained steve says give it a five out of five tastes just like the in the fourth and fifth it tastes just like the first tip so get that earthy tangerine kind of a grapefruit taste but that sweet stuff like I said the fourth or fifth it tastes just like the first is a 502 pot for the outer greens taste test and the high definitely give it a 5 out of 5 definitely very strong very potent I definitely would say it is a morning - out early afternoon strain that's be very energetic it's a Tifa head high no CBD high really it cutoff does mainly 90% I'd say it's a Teva head high but like I said very energetic morning to early afternoon strength definitely very strong very potent hit you right away that first hit it hits your face and it hit you strong so a 5 out of 5 for the high and my official review tier of this tangi I give this a 5 out of 5 this is a top-shelf strain here this is amazing stuff smells amazing tastes amazing I haven't got that tangerine that grapefruit tastes before so that is a new taste that I have that I haven't experienced until today with cannabis so love the smell love the taste love the high five out of five they'll be some top-shelf cannabis definitely recommend you guys to go to recreational medical wherever you get your

for the cloud cover bought this speedy james couple days ago yesterday actually about it yesterday in a rolled-up joint of it sour 10g Sour Diesel and tangi cross finish of this this is another some of their good like their high quality stuff twenty dollars mate focus you can see nice uniform looking nugs no [ __ ] on there at all and see all the colors that's good stuff so the popcorn but it's to need popcorn bets turn about half this just won't do I have this now but I'm not gonna do that right now I already smoked a CBD joint from local liquor store so we'd now so picked up some of that stuff out of quite a different feeling on it am i burying the plants inside because they were getting too stressed out out here plus it's raining today so they keep you out in the rain [Music] and I figured I'd smoke today because right after I got home because I don't have any plants we need to go anywhere or today one of these days I will have to go to game stopping in an Xbox headset for now but CEO wait with that all right now let's get into the stream review 20 so tangi by a cloud cover th e 22.8 6% CV point 0 6 percent let's go Cheers mmm and see the difference between my stuff in this stuff you can look back at some of the videos some of the weed that I grew you can just see the quality in the ass right there nice white ash taps off just easily this is a difference between top-shelf and my stuff which is like I mean I would say my stuff's made grade already starting to fill it just from a couple hits what's the difference but some happy frog potting soil from healthy harvest for the plants so what's this rainy weather stops I'll throw them outside again and oh they will go into their 15 gallon smart pots in it so smooth so tasty this tastes like oranges tangerines a little bit of sourness early colonists our news reminiscent of sourness they've been going and clean my room up after I finish smoking this it's my true that's filthy man oh man Wow now the rest of what I have of this of this eight I'm saving this let's go sit in my room for a while it's the best stuff but best stuff I have right now I should enjoy it well I should go I enjoy it I want to enjoy it savory you know yeah there's top-shelf if you're looking for some chronic I'm gonna be James I got there are high grade stuff is good it's no joke this is the same are better than the best stuff I've ever bought on the street it's probably better [Music] and what I bought on the street back when I was 18 19 just all the stuff that I had before where I could buy what I wanted to the best of the best I can feel it the quality is there this is good top shelf flour on the looks 10 out of 10 on the taste 10 out of 10 on the scale kind of 10 on the high 10 minutes and this is this is top shelf weed this is the good [ __ ] and I haven't bought stuff like this in a long time at least it's been at least a year just go here more since I was able to buy stuff like this or that I wanted to buy something yes I'm already so baked summer a couple of drags off from this Wow keeping bowl bowls at this that's it kiss smoke that plastic plastic yeah that is top-shelf lead that's yeah that's got me really stoned so that's really good that's quality definitely go pick up some of that [ __ ] sour tangi see I told you it's good so good alright that's gonna be all for now guys I will see you all the next three are you Oh", "OvbK1wdm2_M": "it's bill coming back at you again with another video and today we're gonna be cutting down this second Sauer skunk og cush cross Otto okay guys so a few days ago I posted the video where I cut down the first Sauer skunk og cush cross Otto that he grew underneath of the TS 1000 blant I really enjoyed her it's very compact short I did a lot of training on her a lot of LSD and defoliation so now we're gonna pull out the biggest of the three and we're gonna chop this one down so let's take a look at it okay guys so there she is she grew to be quite a good-sized plant let's take a look at the training didn't do too much to her at all as far as LSD I pulled the main top down once and then I did pull out a couple of these side branches and the rest is is all generic just how she grew so now she is probably about four feet tall with some really nice buds let's take a close-up to some of these buds you can see the leaves are done they've done their job and now they're going away so yeah really nice frosty I love the colors they're the purples the Purple's coming out beautiful let's take a look at this bud structure here quite dense not as dense as the little mugs on the the first one but still I mean pretty darn dense not bad at all again I love those I love the colors they're really pretty pretty good-sized buds I can't get my fingers around those at all and quite long with some satellites on the side here this is the the biggest bud here the tallest one see if we can get in here they can blocking the light from my from my light but very nice yeah this one is quite a big bud now on the other side of this this was the side that was towards the light and we can see there's a few Fox tails here nothing major but so by seeing it like this I've done videos before on Fox tails about whether it's in the genetics or if it's due to the environment this is definitely environmental the lights were just a bit too much on this side and I was going to turn them off but then I decided just to let them go and see how that worked and so we have the Fox tails on that side but then if we come over on this side there's no Fox tails so we know this is definitely an environmental Fox tailing which is not a good thing at all but I left it there because I I wanted to be able to show you the difference the other plant that I did was genetics because there was Fox tails all over the plant so this here actually is the main top itself but it's not as big as some of the other ones but all look pretty good we'll get a shot down around here got some fallen over I had to tie up quite a bit now this was grown under the 315 C mhm and also a cheap 800 watt cob which pulls 210 from the wall so okay let's take a look down here we got some lower ones here obviously not as big it's still nice and frosty still fairly dense that one's a little bit squishy that one's a little squishy but not bad so really this plant was lollipop so there's not much life there at all maybe just to cut well that's not bad actually but it was opened up so much ID foliated this pretty heavily it was opened up so much that the light could get right to those bottom ones down there you can see them from here so not too much large at all all good quality bud so what we're gonna do is I'm going to pause this video for a moment it's probably gonna be quite a moment but for you it's gonna seem like a second but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pull off all these dead leaves these yellow leaves and then I'll come back and I'm going to harvest so I'll we will be back in a second okay guys it's been a second I got all the leaves pulled off of her she's all ready to go let's just take one more quick look at her without her clothes on so I've taken off most of the fan leaves and she looks really good now with this one I think what I'm gonna do is the smaller one I cut down in one piece I did end up separating it into a few different pieces because it was so thick now these here the buds the colas are so thick that I'm gonna cut them down by branch and hang them that way because I want to get lots of air movement through this and I mean she's she's pretty thick there so so what I'll do is I'll stick you guys on the tripod and I'll get to harvestin [Music] [Music] [Music] so we got it all down let's take a look and see what we got alright so there she is quite a bit off this girl let's take a closer look we can see the beverage container up there they can for size reference looks pretty small up there compared to some of these long colas so let's just take a look here we've got some really nice long long thick colas and some of them there's a beautiful one there it's got some really nice Purple's going on that was right up to the top there some smaller ones from down below still nice and frosty so gotta love that there's a nice juicy thick one there alright let's go over to the other side I wasn't growing under this Mars hydro it just happened to still be there from my last harvest so I decided to use it for for lighting but there's another beautiful beautiful bud there and some some more smaller ones there from from down below very nice so what did we get off of her as far as weight wise just from eyeballing it I'm usually pretty close at this taking into consideration the size and the density of the buds and how heavy they are when I when I harvest I'm gonna guesstimate one two three four five six seven maybe eight eight ounces off of that so not bad at all it's half a pound what I'll do is I'm gonna trim this up these are dense enough that I can cut these off the stems and throw them in my Bowl trimmer so I think I'll do that tonight actually I'll do it right now while it's nice impression the leaves are still sticking out pretty good so I'll do that right now and once I get them dried up then I'll come back and maybe we'll do a wait video if not I will definitely leave the weight down and in the description okay guys so that's it for the harvest of the second Cyrus come koji push cross and I got these seeds from friends of mine down in the States frost brothers frost Bros genetics they're not for sale yet I'm pretty sure they're still in the breeding stage where they're trying to lock down certain phenotypes and and stuff like that so these seeds won't be available yet they should be in the future so you can check out down below in the description I'll have a link to their Instagram you can check them out on there and I'm sure if you have any questions they'll be able to answer them for you so that's it for this one like share subscribe leave a comment down below I'll try to get back to you if I can sometimes not enough hours in the day but I try to get back to each and every one here check out my patreon if you like just started that up the other day we'll see you on the next one guys happy groan", "dywTc7SJpwo": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm dead and we got a little strain of you don't forget it's been a while since we reviewed some weed so we decided to go today and try to find some fire went on to try and Santa Cruz I think we did yeah capital healing Association have this jack tange what a good combo yeah great combo no like [ __ ] if I could there's like two of my favorite flavors two of the strongest most dominating you know flavors that you can find and we've that that pretty much exists at least you know around here that I've smoked and you know but that being said Mary had him I've never had a cross I've never had to be up yeah I think they did a great job because to me it looks it looks like Jack Daniels got the big nose you know I think there's a being here that weighs under Granberry yeah these are definitely all the knockers every nook in this bag is just like you saying this nice big yeah but it smell it's just like the tans you know I tell you or tangelo or there's so many got that citrusy orange flavor in the bag but I get kind of different smell when I break it up yeah you like when you crack the nut you almost it's like more of the jack almost comes out the jack doing this comes out but I thought the orange citrusy almost kind of turns into like it a creamy citrusy oh that's like a creamsicle or something - orange creamsicle yeah you're right wow wow wow it's really just caked up in there yeah those calyxes are really really tall not only is it caked up but it just it has even more the appearance are affected just being covered in frost because of the size of the characters yeah as you guys look at these close-ups right here you'll see how caked up it really is just perfect [ __ ] pointy pointy nose structure and you know I was gonna say indicative but I said indicative of a sativa dominant yeah it also has a little bit of purple in there which I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure where it's coming from the only thing that I've seen is there is some Jack the Ripper's that I've smoked that do you have like a purple hue to so I think that is where the perp could have came from there's not much of it it's almost just like a huge so yeah I definitely never seen any of the tan strains come out perfectly that the [ __ ] tangi and green tangelo agent or metal M&G they're all all very similar that that terpene in general it usually comes out pretty free you know never seen a gun kind of crazy looking though yeah I got a good amount of those light orange hairs scattered throughout real pointy nodes but just like it's a big fat calyx is the kind of like bust out in every direction looks this you know this is kind of what I want my weed to look like this looks like some good jacket it has the SML I was looking for the flavors on point too so far yes most of all that last that last rib was was pretty similar to the smell that I'm getting off of it yeah remember that like orangey creamy yeah really smooth smoke yeah I definitely definitely like the or g1g flavor I get from that not so much jacking the flavor but definitely comes out when you crack it open like this overall yeah I'm getting much more the tangi properties the smell the taste you know just just everything except I think except it'll look exactly it looks like Jack yeah it looks like straight Jack but I would say they did a really good job on the cross digging there's really nothing I've changed it's got a good ring John its overall good set out the tail looking for something so good we found it for sure you see they're rockin beat your bottoms today I'm using this is a new piece of Rito's actually it's actually a really old Aragon version until the day it's pretty nice I'm hitting the ear off speaker bottom a 4.0 definitely throwing it back a little bit with the Baker bottoms I'm diggin the sweet nice little buzz set in this is gonna be your daytime smoker if it stays here too you know what these what these trains are usually good for yeah I'm gonna have all those really really good it's a team of properties I mean I love a good sativa dude if not only for them later but the high it just gets you motivated to like to go throughout your day and I love smoking oh geez but I can't do that [ __ ] all day long you know waking up especially you know the indica dominant oh geez ya can smoke them but not gonna get so much stuff done this stuff kind of gives you that I think that's why I left this created yeah I think that's why I like this read so much because we've been on the og for so long like that's all like this movie for like the past three weeks to a month and then we come across something like this it's real up in here much different than I got way thicker flavor on that one in the last couple ribs now what is that about I feel like the second hit was always much taste I also packed that bowl a little bit too tight you guys knows but I was like struggling to get the smoke up to the top of the bong if there's and then it hit a point where it got to the top where it just kind of you know some air was able to get through here and then like milk duct really fast about me so I got kind of a grip but it was like taste really really yeah definitely definitely think the the tange is the dominating definitely dominating force here in this cross I think it looks like 6040 but it pulled all the best traits out of the jack - I gotta like you know as far as the note structure a lot of times tangent ends to be a little bit sy marring fluffy this is definitely you know it's pretty pretty rocked up gents it's yeah it's like dance but well I don't know I don't know how to explain it I think sound like a [ __ ] but it's like dense and fluffy at the same time he does yeah I mean it has a little little ease to it but then they only go so far and he's like yeah the perfect structure the look yeah I'm gonna go ten out of ten on the [ __ ] smoked really really well - yeah I think he's got a really really good flush honor that that that flavors are really really clean yeah you tens of tens are rare on this show Amamiya tens is really good enough but this is definitely I haven't decided yet what I'm gonna read it but it's gonna be pretty close yeah I mean it's nice and fresh but it's definitely dry-cured very very well Aaron well you can tell this flush good because of the flavor they had just got this stuff in like the day today not surprised that we've that much balance of fire there because I hadn't been there a long time the fact this is this I'm always excited to try new crosses that I have had before you know and this is one that if I were to eat rendered it you know sit down and ask me come up with some green crosses this probably would have been some more yeah just because Jack just also makes me feel so much better you know can just seem to be somewhat of a smaller yielding plant you know yeah then the jacket looks like there was a perfect across got me feeling really really nice buzz right now although not quite as from how I got through jack is it more like kind of the way that two tangents me sometimes like mellow but yet not you know it down hi there you're still alright guys thanks for joining us again for another video strain to reduce etz Chaim I'm dead", "Xx-EW6tJSYE": "[Music] welcome to we entertainment I'm Michael some people call me the doctor and today we're gonna try chan G this is tan G it really smells orange e this is a sativa so this is a lighter flower even though they can still be very strong I would say it's on the lighter side more energetic you can see it's a little bit orange it's a little bit less dark green than other ones it's got a lot of little brown hair is in here too grinds up really nice it's not as sticky as some of the other flowers we have ground some up right here we've put it into a little vapor Cup straw about one already brewing in here I got this flower from goddess delivers it's an online service you can see says Dan gene the way it was 4.25 GE sativa and we're gonna check it out let's see tangey from goddess delivers Wow it's very flavorful this flower really tastes different than other flowers it doesn't taste like any of the other flowers and I would say it's good for once in a while because I actually like the taste of of weed this tastes like weed plus something I don't know if it has something else in it I don't think so but he's very orange it's still really nice there's some people that want a little flavor extra flavor and then flower it's very good you know I tried this and I would say I liked it is it my favorite sativa no is it my favorite tangi I've tried I would say it's good it's really good I was surprised I have a very high scale for quality so if I say something's good you can generally think it's very good what I ordered again I would say that I'm going to try and know the chain tangi before you order this again but I'm a you know the one thing like I said is it's very orange so I this wouldn't be something I would do every day this would be something I do once in a while so in the end what do I think tangey goddess delivers I'm gonna start to give a 1 to 10 scale I'm gonna give tangi from 1 to 10 a 6 and a half which is good maybe a 7 it's in there it's good is it a time no it was a 10 that would be unbelievable but it's not but I'm feeling it so I recommend it try it goddess delivers tangi this is Michael the doctor for paper cup using the vapor cup already all my friends [Music]", "4VXD54CVBwA": "what up BGC rain bucket down here I got the most of the big harvest done from the cuvette there she should trip down to bare bones right now I'll come back right before or right after the next rain probably and take the rest of that it's supposed to rain another four or five days I think not sure this thing right here heart Angie I'm getting ready to take her right now I think she's showing about mostly milky on the trichomes sorry I didn't get any close-ups of the bugs on the cuvette let's see if we can do that quite proud of this plant here or in these plants anyway this is five plants right here's what large [Music]", "46w0_s7q1_E": "I rest up everybody remain home yet EF India's right here bringing as a little review and a little smoke out we got a sticky I'm super excited it's a sour tangi I wanted a really hard-hitting sativa strictly sativa cuz I wanted something that you know I could take to my show I got some guests going on so I wanted something that was just gonna really [ __ ] us up honestly like I can get us something that's gonna be chill but what makes for entertainment is watching other people really smash and try to have a good of time and try to keep themselves composed so that's what I decided to go with 80% THC one thing that I do want to point out is on the back it says prop 65 warning this product can expose you to chemicals including marijuana smoke which is known at the state of California to cause cancer now that's a joke cuz we all know it does not alright so the way you open it you just push through pop it out and there she is gold everybody knows dizzy they're they're really solid products I wouldn't really fear something bad happening like you know you've had lung problems with certain people and people have died i don't think thats tizzy is gonna be in that same range I think that they're gonna be a-okay but I wouldn't go about smoking vapes every day or I wouldn't even go about buying them as much as I used to but because I do have my show check it out Tuesdays live at 10:00 highly elevated radio you know it's it's kind of hard to smoke a blunt or smoke actual flowers somewhere where you're not supposed to you know it's and I don't care the only thing is though I don't want to lose my show and I don't want to get complained on and lose all the effort that I've gone through so I'm just trying to be smart at the same time I am still taking the the risk because I'm trying to give the best show but none of none of that matters right now right now we're gonna do a review of the sour tangi I'm super excited let's just hit it I forgot how I'm strong beeps work that's how long it's been so one good hit as you guys can tell I couldn't hold it in very strong flavor very strong flavor it does have a little bit of a the lady was saying kind of a citrusy and intruder flour taste um let's take it one more time I'm gonna get a clear taste sour sour 10g you know sometimes certain strains that their names don't affiliate with their flower with their the look or the taste or the smell but this one sour tangi it it's [ __ ] sour tangi I taste it it's really delicious it's a really mellow hitting I'm energetic I'm very energetic I'm talkative I'm focused definitely true to a sativa I think that if I was to continue hitting it which I will just cuz you know I need to review it guys and if many of you guys out there hit it or smoke the way I smoke I know that you're gonna want me to keep going and going until I tap out because you want to see what it affects me when I get to that point because you want to get to that point too right am I am I wrong you want to get stupid high and that's why I'm doing this so the people who want to get stupid I know that hey this is definitely worth it or hate that definitely isn't worth it it was $38 $34 with the early bird special so I mean it's it's touching in on a gram or not a gram it's touching in around an eighth of uh of any kind of flour especially once you start going above into the mid-range level there's the short eight twenty bucks twenty five to thirty but you know after thirty you started getting to a lot better quality and sometimes I really questioned it I think that getting ass dizzy half gram for me wouldn't last as long as an eighth because with an eighth I can kind of slow a slow my smoke a little bit I can you know just hold back but with this dizzy or with tiny kind of concentrate it's a lot easier to keep consuming because a you're not going to smell it and be it's easier to consume I don't have to pack a bowl I don't have to do nothing I put it in the battery and that's all it is it's just so much more accessible that you just got to go through it so much faster because it's easier of course the holy downfall is the battery you know you got to charge it you got to make sure it's charged and I want to hit it all night so I have to consistently worry about it there's their ups and downs as far as this actual this actual taste it tastes good it tastes like sour tej I give it an 8 8 out of 10 2 out of 3 as far as a high 9 I want to say 10 but 10 is as tennis it has to be that that where you know what - 10 you know I mean I just want to say it's a 10 I just want to give it more credit because it's so good and I haven't had something this good in a while to be honest I haven't gotten this high in a cool minute but it's still it's just like regular vape high you know it's not that 99% or even if it's flower like you know there's certain highs that it's just it's just great to be in and this is so close to it it's a nine out of ten nine point five nine point nine if it just put me over the edge a lot faster a lot harder a lot quicker you know I would give it to ten it's clear it's close but ten is ten is a ten for a reason and this this is close eight on flavor ten like 99.9 on on high I think that this is really fast hitting I've hit it maybe what three four times and it's already there I'm good I'm chilling me being me and wanting to consume as hard as I do I'll take one more hit just for you guys you know you guys want me to take a good a good rip I want you to pause the video comment below take a big hit come back and then at that point I only want to say it's a 10 out of 10 cuz I haven't been this this faded in a while I don't want to give it a score that I'm basing on just because I haven't had anything else to review you know what I mean I want to stay true to what my instinct is saying and it's nine point five nine point nine but at ten we've all had those tens those rare moments where you were just you wanted it's not even like you were [ __ ] up you were just you were in a good place and you felt good you felt right and that's almost there yo stick I just I I support dizzy they make a really good product they're priced relatively relatively competitive because yeah they're a little bit more for a half gram but its quality you know you're really getting a good quality it's just a bang for your buck bang for your buck for sure so yeah if you're interested in getting any kind of sticky go for it if you're looking for a good sativa and you're looking at the Sauer tangi and you're thinking about it I would say try it but depending on who you are there's higher level THC at lower level THC which it doesn't always matter but I believe that the overall profile makes what you're gonna experience you know so total CBD two point four three milligrams you know and and that CBD is gonna do other things for your body you know so if you get no CBD then like if you have you know a little bit of inflammation I get inflammation on my knee and I take it it's gonna make it just feel a little bit more bearable like you may not notice it as much and and that's the thing too like always look at the entire profile I'm not trying to preach on how to how to purchase I'm just trying to educate and let people know that there's more to these just two chemicals there's a whole plethora of chemical inside the flower that it can help you in it like if you have depression if you have information if you have eating disorders you know I mean like there's certain strains that helps press your your appetite and not in a way that's gonna starve you but you know some people stress eat some people really don't know how to how to like eat more eat less so just you know if you're not hungry and your body is not hungry and you take a certain chemical and it hits you and you recognize that in you it's like it could change people's lives and in a small scale I'm not saying it's gonna dramatically affect you because you have to ultimately want to change and I know getting really pretty so I'm gonna like dial it way back and I'm just gonna give it a ten at this point I didn't want to but um we'll give this a 10 a 10 this is probably one of the best highs I've ever had straight up so sticky you make a great product I know I'm looking all crazy guys I'm going to the gym I just wanted to make this bit video before I did and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed that so please like share and subscribe I would check out my radio show xx twist media.com I go alive Tuesdays at 10:00 p.m. we talk about whatever go on till my Instagram at any efendi's to watch us do it live visually so you can either have the audio version or you can have the video version it's all up to you and that's all I got to say guys I'm out", "1EzT71Ls72g": "what's up guys today I'm doing a review on a fake Roth cart that I just got now I know that's fake because I got it from a you know one of my one of the dudes that I know no I live in my neighborhood so yeah you know it's not real unless coming from the actual dispensary but even even then like some delivery services some shady delivery services have actually you know I've bought in a fake cart off a [ __ ] delivery service before but I was like around two years ago but this [ __ ] this [ __ ] is straight from I just want from some dude so look at it it shows the manufacturing day packaging day and then the expiration date now I know these are fake because like I said these came from my friend 75 cent THC now this is how it came actually had a little sticker right here that was on here but it basically just said tore it off so I did I'm gonna open it [Applause] all right [Applause] [Music] I just comes with this road construction thing cartridge use and care instructions says your cartridges preheat time do not preheat steady hits 5 seconds or less are ideal for optimal continued performance if the cartridge air flow feels restricted unscrew from battery one quarter one quarter turn because care blah blah blah blah so the actual cartridge now so there's the actual cartridge that way I bought this for 25 a gram supposed to be a simple ooh he's young masters glue you know hook [Applause] I'm tasty look good [Applause] so I shall put them out how much another they watch a little guru the top it's pretty good it's like my shabu everybody you can taste the tea I taste good but it kinda tastes like this was on there yeah I don't taste that bad I'm gonna actually hit it now on asleep feels like I'm taking it down don't taste that bad but yeah so that was a look at a fake road part that's what a fake profile", "HxPQKg1VP50": "[Music] I mean do I ever feel like I would been selling seeds I mean I didn't think we would have a company called DNA genetics being able to produce viable seeds is a very serious business I think DNA genetics is probably the best a seed breeder out there we've been very impressed with their work we know plenty of growers that have really want their genetics they are known to have some of the best house strains out there so yeah you really do need seeds everyone that I know and ever grown a DNA genetics seed has come up with some serious fire it's really hard to make seeds the whole science camerin DNA genetics Amsterdam as a breeder you try to look for something that has all the winning qualities we go into breeding projects with okay we want the yield of this variety with the smell of this variety and because really it's it's about the terpenes the terpenes are the are the flavors that you taste and the smells that you see that you smell when people talk about oh I got the highest THC or I got the highest CBD but what they're not talking about because they don't know it's the flavors and the smells are really the most medicinal part of the plant when I got to amp sham I wasn't so impressed with the cannabis there it wasn't on par with what we had in California we saw an opportunity to bring some freshness into the system now in holland and give it some california love so we basically brought California to Amsterdam we took a clone called the fe from LA if there was a short plant it smelled great it tasted great everything except for his growth pattern was great we took a feat and cross it into another Afghani variety to get it closer to that one thing that we were looking for that's how we came up with LA Confidential look it gave some freshness into the community something new something new for the coffee shops to have it's it's one of our best selling strains out of Amsterdam we still love it and that's the seeds that we've been putting out for almost 11 years now over a decade it's a great strain it reminds me of California we grow it we select it then we have to taste it and try it to see if it's good enough for them to put out on the market [Music] there's a few strains that are popular here in LA kosher Kush tangi you know there's a there's a few different ones that are really popular out here that are that we're behind I think it seeds touch more of the world than a clone could touch our seeds can be found everywhere in the world well you can tell the differences between strains by their seeds some seeds are bigger some seeds are darker some seeds are lighter some might be really round so might be really tiny le confidential seeds have actually have a unique shape to them they're a little bit longer different strains different varieties make different shapes eat another way to tell if seeds if they're good or bad the finger test the seeds are very strong and a nice healthy machine won't break when you put your finger down on it like that right here we have a seed that hasn't come out of its seed pod yet then you have a fully developed scene in the middle and then right here you have an immature seed so pollinate a plant there's all different ways you can literally just go like that pollen is almost lighter than air and when that pollen flies around in the room it hits those little white hairs that are on the plant it produces a seat in that calyx if the timing has to be right just like a baby or human it's really unique to have someone else like come up to and say hey you know those freebie seeds you gave to me like eight years ago I just entered the cannabis cup with them [Music] we like to create new varieties because you know you're evolving you're evolving the market you're evolving the medicine you're creating new things it's been 11 years now that we've been in business and 11 years now people are enjoying everything that we've been breeding so I guess they enjoy our taste seeds you know I'll not say cannabis has gotten me everything that I've ever done [Music]", "xWaEDnwJqQk": "when you're in the market you're looking for different kinds of strains no we know each affects your body is pretty important luckily for you it's not as a complicated as you may have thought cannabis can be broken down into two different strains sativa and indica but before we go into the breakdown of each strains let's go ahead sleppy guys with a little bit of farmer knowledge sativa had originated from a warmer climate countries such as Mexico Thailand in Southeast Asia and was first classified by charge Linnaeus back in 1753 if you're planning on growing this in your back room without your mom really knowing is probably not the best idea you see these plants on average grew around six feet but hand getting much taller there's no sneaking around with this guy indica is on the other hand love cooler environments and was originated in the Middle East so I tip my hat to all you Muslims out there because it's my personal favorite it was classified as a second species of cannabis by Gene Landmark back in 1785 and it could grows a little bit shorter around two to four feet also takes less time to fully mature unlike sativa now that we got that out of the way let's go ahead and get into the juicy part of this video this science behind it while both strings have THC and CBD which is how we effects your body the ratio on each are different starting with sativa it's a little bit higher ratio of THC compared to CBD unlike indicas that have more CBD than TVC to keep the video short on the lowest levels THC acts as a stimulant and CBD relaxes the body they kind of work like a yin and yang of two different sides sativa gives you more focus promoting creativity energizes you and while giving you a nice head high on the other side of the scale and because are more of relaxation embodied high imagine this typical stoner who's on the couch eating food chances are he was smoking some kind of indica strains now that you know a little bit more about them when is the best time to take the strings well that one's pretty easy sativas in the morning because it gives you more energy and more focus and indicas there at the night because it relaxes your body and allows you to fall asleep a little bit faster if you're series of what my favorite strings of indica and sativa are that is a video for it next time but go ahead and leave a comment down below so I know that you're interested if you guys liked the video go ahead and slap that bad boy the thumbs up and if you didn't that's what the dislike button is for if you guys want to see more content related to cannabis or just random videos help

says expect large eels or frosty dense flowers amazing color and a tense aroma and you know what I'll have to only sentences of one of very few strains I've had and that [ __ ] overpowered the diesels

I'm [ __ ] highly recommend this at about four stars out of five only reason not being a five is it didn't have the amazing quality like you know some of the strains I've been seeing lately like I'm I

crowd of smokers tucker's and everybody else out there this is the second part of the harvest I've had everything hanging for about five days it's been hanging in about 45% to 50% humidity the whole

loving youtubers at your boy buds back for another update on day 38 of the flowering Sour Diesel someone take you guys in here show you what's going on with her after our feeding today just gave her a feeding just a little bit ago so let me get my tell you guys what I gave her all right today 38 feeding we did two milliliters of the seaweed extract 7 milliliters of the balloon 4 milliliters of the cal-mag drop that down a little bit because it doesn't really need that as much now and did 7 milliliters of a cool bloom by general hydroponics did the honey molasses and did a pH of 6.3 and a ppm after that was 609 so last feeding which would have been about 4 or 5 days ago was at 575 and that was after we did that pH flush one thing I did see this morning was a few very very low leaves much like this one right here just falling basically right off I mean fairly even having a tug and they're just coming right off so I'm not sure what's going on with there again it has been a little bit since she got that last meeting so that could be just you know she's hungry so let's hope she bounces back so I'm also going to edit in a night shot two of this so you guys can have a better look of it yeah these nugs are they're definitely getting fatter I've still got some issues with these stocks I'm not sure if that's a big issue or not but I've got some purple in on the stocks I mean it could look healthier that's for sure yeah these buds are looking good you guys and it's smelling good too getting some good frost production in there pretty dense so yeah that's what's going on in the closet you guys [Music] just willing to show you little update on the day 38 any questions or comments please leave those down below always like to hear what you guys have to say if that thumbs up if you guys like the buzz like these Sour Diesel butts if that thumbs up for me on this video you guys I'm gonna see how many I can get if we can get everybody to watch this if that thumbs up dude that'd be awesome all right I'm gonna turn you guys over to the Cologne and show you what's going on with her as I as I get for a feeding - so I'll catch you guys here just a second all right guys I got a feeding here all mixed up for the clone and today is day 23 on this clone and the last time I measured forget what day that was that I measured but it was like 9 inches or something like that and if we look now she's just about it 13 inches so and it's probably about less than a week's time since I did that and I know this soil is overdue for a watering I've been pretty busy these last few days so I'm just now getting to this feeding so from this feeding I just did two and a half milliliters of the seaweed extract and then 2 milliliters of cal-mag so and this is only like a half a gallon so no sense in doing a whole gallon because it's not going to take a whole gallon then I did a little bit of honey my ppm s for 161 after I PhD it to 6.3 so I'm going to go ahead and give her the speeding and I'm sure she's going to love it cuz like I said it's been oh gosh let me see how many days oh gosh it's been almost a week yeah actually today's a week I believe because she would have gotten fed when I did the transplant and that was exactly a week ago so do this she is looking pretty good she is outgrowing the tote though like pretty quickly and she's throwing pistols because the light cycles kind of at least I believe she is for some reason yeah she's starting to throw pistols because I got to get a separate timer for the tote so it's got a set light pattern all the time consistently and lately it's just kind of been thrown off a little bit so once I mean actually doesn't bother me because I could just kind of throw this in the closet and do like a micro grow because I've never grown a plant without LS keying it before is this is the first one I just didn't get to it in time I planned on it but I just didn't get to it in time and now the stalks just too too stiff to bend it without breaking it so not gonna take that risk she just kind of grow it a little weird down here I mean it's I did tell you guys I topped it there's the pistol as you can see yeah I did top it so right in there so yeah that's what's going on with it though it looks pretty good being my first close yeah I'm gonna have to figure something out because I'm gonna have to have this one done by the time my landlord stops over here to do some renovations and I'm gonna have to have the one in the closet this is our diesel in there I'm gonna have to have that like [ __ ] cut and harvested before then otherwise you know it's gonna [ __ ] smell everywhere and [Music] so yeah that's what's going on I need to that's why I'm trying to figure out what I should do with this one because it's really realistically it's outgrowing the toe and I can't keep it in there I'm gonna try to but it's gonna be hard I would have topped it or LST it I could have got away with it a little bit longer but that's not gonna happen this time so that's the clone though just one got a fill you in on what was going on with that and show you the feeding let you know what's going on with her yeah she'll like this feeding though she was pretty dried she was ready for it so hopefully we'll see some faster growth in some of these but all right you guys I will catch you in the next update I
