of this review and it's not ordinary kind of this review so this one's going to be coming out in the week so what we've got here is the og Chilam we're trying to do this property they're hard for us like I said before it's got a few finger marks on it forgot to wipe it down before we start the video but we've took some pictures we've been looking up like where your children start from it would have been a plain Chilam it would have gone into like a conical shape a bit like a traffic cone shape and they would wrap a rag at the bottom and they would like cut hit in between the fingers and stuff like that sometimes you use a pebble or stone as the balls so it would get quite hot when the brac was there is like a thing to call it down basically it mainly was like it originated in like India I think it was don't hold me to it but they've made glass versions these and best versions because they're in like really nothing holding it in here so you've got a packet quite a lot to start off with just to give it that extra bit so it's not too too hot and just dump hot too much on it like it's not like a bong hit it's not like a pipe here you're just doing small little puffs no one again Isis packed what we've got in there is we've got some star dog mixed with some probably exclusive purple dog mixed with some chocolate local CBD hash if you haven't seen the review of that links gonna be in the description go check it out and then topped off with a bit more startup as you can see down through there hopefully well you going to see pictures anyway but this is pretty packed inside of here so this should last as a nice little little time we are going to struggle because we've got this we're going to try and like with this we've got a windproof lighter so hopefully it actually helps us like the Chilam a little easier so once we've got it lit we're going to light it like this for a stop once we've got it lit we are going to try and do a one-handed method hopefully it works be able to light the Chilam so first time trying to chill up so we're going to let you know exactly how it is so we've got our whimpering fire we've got a chillin right you might have packed it a little too tight now there we go when you give it up get to the end of it don't talk it as hard because when you get to there get much pop pop back and hit me in the throat so part my memory is for guys basically did do most of the video as you can see nice little bit white ashen now some of this gray is is the some of its not burnt properly we still got a bit too burnt but we was hitting the children properly but after that again obviously those all storage was filled up on our phone and we forgot to delete some old videos so just trying like this again that's that now that was the last hit but as you can see space with us the og chillin it's a really nice piece of kit so basically you're not meant to do it in a middle finger and the ring finger only meant to do an odd little finger and the ring finger that's the original wave but I just can't get used to that because broke my knuckles quite so so basically you could smoke it this way if you smoke it that way that way the original way you can use it I would say is like a bit of a doctor foot bongs so if you want to feel any side up you can fill it right up on this side and just a massive like yep so it fits in your downstem so if you've got a nice luck connection that fits on that fill that up you can have a nice long here if you really wanted to there's a couple different ways and stuff up to use it I'm feeling quite high this star though purple dog and the chocolate local partners kicked in really nicely it's really nice hit on it um it's not as harsh as I thought it was going to be some pipes have been a lot harsher so yeah but ot Chilam some nice like resin buildup in there as well nice resin builder you can see after a while of using this if you I'll call wash this you would get some nice reclaimed buck so there's a good little handy tool to smoke some material through and still get reclaim as well because it's glass is a lot more easier to clean and get you material but if you know how to anyways guys this has been a really nice one children ot chillin May she gets off one I got this one from my marital mystery box if you haven't checked that video up I think it's gonna be in the description got a load of different things there was like parsley stuff that was for the giveaway so then we basically put some of the stuff that we want inside and now we're reviewing some of things for you guys we've still got a pickle drip pipe another American pipe a bracelet pipe some bowling like material like rips left not wrapped up in cigar people blunt wrap so backward split bulbs we've got the og sweet ones in the on point so gonna be rolling with them and we got some hemp natural wrap I think it is but yeah I'm very slow at the moment that's just hit me about a hundred mile an hour

subscribe is toxic me say I'm out of here [Music] [Applause]", "VjsJCbDwPKI": "[Music] so what's the objective today we have ourselves a double helix chillin and that's it right there it seems pretty straightforward everybody primarily I guess knows what a Chilam is I think of a challenge is something a real simple smoking device that you would just put between your fingers and smoke like this and I mean that's my belief and that and it's pretty basic it's there's not there's not much to it other than that and until I met TK I didn't I had no idea the intricacies and the details and you know the thicknesses and whole philosophies and ideals behind the Chilam except we're grinding up the yeah I just ruined I just ground up a little piece of the Kim 91 and Sour Diesel oh nice twenty point eight six percent THC yeah very low on the CBD got a CBD heavy strain we're in Oregon so we just walk down the street and there's dispensaries all around we can you can pretty much turn to Amsterdam yeah you can pretty much trip over them here yeah pretty pretty much six gram limit per visit first perk for day per store and I buy grams at a time so I go to and get seven flavors and every place I visit so for recreational weekend you can do up to how much at one time up to seven grams per store per day so you know you can get a lot if you hit up a lot of different stores but we're trying to buy big amounts you know obviously the biggest and once you can find a time as a quarter so you can get a quarter of a single thing from a place or you know two eighths or seven you know individual grams can't you just go to different stores though yeah absolutely go to the for sure hmm or go back to the same one you know day after day I mean you're looking at pain anywhere from seven or eight at the low end up to 13 14 15 grams dollars a gram at the high okay so I just loaded helix not cleanest at the moment very very thick and heavy glass very well made hand-blown bought from a head shop in Dallas Texas that has a very very very amazing stuff as you can see the double helix and lookit you know and that is a point oh seven grand Bowl so very very very small amount so if you're getting you know Graham from a place for you know say ten bucks yeah you know you're looking at about fifteen fourteen fifteen helix bowls and for a lightweight this is more than enough I mean you and I share this only that's plenty that's plenty we're about to go throw some discs after this at the park little disc action and this is more than enough for that so so why helix I mean I mean I think the whole purpose of me asking you is because I was fascinated by your passion and your understanding behind it and that's that's what I think well there for people to know you know at most shops that you'll go do to buy glass it's thin glass more import glass almost all import glass is the thin style of glass and anyone who knows anything about smoking will know what I'm talking about and I don't know if you can tell but helix is like solid glass through it's very very thick yeah very very heavy I have personally never seen this kind of work at least for this kind of piece Brian war so often time do you drop a piece it breaks because of the thinness of the glass but he looks has been dropped many many times even on concrete and never never broken it has a very small chip at the mouth and but besides that it survived the last five years Wow Wow yeah this is extremely thick and it's helix it's because the artwork in it is that what it is well the heat I mean helix is the style of fuming and it's inside out fuming so the way it's made or the way the actual the smoke funnels when it's lilt has nothing to do it and has nothing to do with that I think you smoke nope it's just it's just the style of fuming that they did for coloring it is created a it's a it's a helix tile pattern mm it could have done you know whatever pattern they wanted and they did a spiral yeah I like it and it's got the knobby which I think it's pretty common yeah and then it has these like divot so I guess you can yep the again yep then yeah the nub keeps it from rolling off of a table or roll it off of a surface right and then the teeth marks allow you to hold it if you learn I hate it like all right without having you know if you're driving or you know whatever you also wanted to cover grinding because very few people grind you don't get an even burn when you don't grind also you have trouble getting it all or having to hit it more times than you ought to and then you're just you know smoking extra you know butane right from the lighter whereas if you grind it you get a very even clean burn also a trickle burn also less of it trails off as you're smoking and you have less waste less runoff less hot box effect that makes more into the lungs more more more more more effective smoking and also much easier to clean out you can blow it out very easily once it's turned to ash whereas if it's in clumps I mean even the other day I forgot my grinder at home and I was just breaking up in my hand but it's still not the same right and it didn't hit the same right so you don't want to just throw it in there can I see that grinder yes absolutely that's awesome it's just fascinating to me and that's what that's what they call a four piece grinder so that's a key shredder most expensive grinder on the market pretty much you know what what I found interesting about this was oh like this oh yeah as when you grind it it gets what is it Keefe yep all the THC trichomes that are on the bud that fall off in the process of grinding fall through the screen and then go down into the bottom into the key compartment we look at them track homes that's all Keith having a deliciously add that to a bowl and spike it by despite your ball not against it but it can be intense because I mean for me I have a hundred varieties in my collection yeah and so there's a lot of varieties contained down in the bottom of this little guy no that's why that's really that's like you could call that your Long Island iced tea of smoking and cocktail of everything it's nice it's fancy it's very fancy I'm excited shall we demonstrate is he smoking oh you're gonna let me take green so absolute little all right that's very that's very generous [Music] sun's out it's been Portland foam very excited behind here in Portland [Music] see very little runoff I mean our and if you noticed I didn't even have a lighter it was already still burning from Bruce's head let spank me yeah yeah and we've we've barely gotten into it I had an entire bowl of this I'm on my way home this morning oh yeah yeah it was great now this is a good one there so this is a sativa that's the other thing a lot of people don't understand the differences between sativa indica sativa is mental hi Ryan mentally stimulating once often times can make you want to get stuff done so I've been cleaning up my room sweeping and rearranging I talked to you about actually getting one of these and you're like this is the one I can't believe how inexpensive it is awesome right right and but you don't even know where to get it here I mean I got it from retro Revolution in Dallas Texas that's a shop it's a shop they have clothing and apparel and accessories and insane retro retro revolution I was working a website - how's work I don't know I won the State Fair and this girl had these cool gauge earrings and I said where'd you get those shoes I got him at my work I've retro revolution so I went there and they had some of the most amazing glass art I've ever seen that's what brought you in I mean well I mean the earrings robbed me and actually need to bind a lot of get earrings from them hmm but I mean but they also had a section half of their if you have digital so I do alright first straight to a four and I'm up - I've been to a two so I have everything from two four six eight and twelve I have like a different earrings and Veitch size really sometimes they only have one now but so you've found that to be a great shop it's the best headshot that I've ever been to evolution in Dallas Texas I'd love to go back but this particular glassblower an entire shelf dedicated to his work and he had a whole bunch of ones that ass come through yep yep yep so that's the end of the bowl you can actually even see through it it's done it's good for about three or four hits for a burro for like a medium casual smoker for some you know heavy hitters maybe just a couple or for some light weights and you saw that one hit drop me drop me oh yeah or you get a one hitter that's a point usually a round of 0.05 grand balls right go by a gram for twenty four ten bucks you're looking at 20 bowls of that and if you're a lightweight and you know that'll have your sets where you know come Lauer's anyway what is it again how so by what a one-hitter right and it's got a hundredth of a gram scale yeah and then get a grinder get a grinder yeah for sure and I think it'll get a little chilling that's a small bowl I mean even it's bigger point 1/2 grams considerably bigger than this and grinding up you know 0.12 grams at a time is a lot so I recommend shooting for 0.05 0.07 ramble which is very small for fur starters yeah I think what I really like is because I've definitely always had a different viewpoint on Jones I've always just thought get keeps bud throw it in there a bit in there about most people do I'm Malou I'm just doing and I never even considered myself to be you know just to care enough about like it like a fine wine that you you've made it sound where I described it and actually it is I mean it's kind of interesting when you do go into dispensaries and you smell like like OG and then you nope and or all these different strains they have a very distinct smell to them oh sure what is it dog it smell like oh yeah I think smoking it tastes like dog a like just dog hair or wet dog or something it's yeah disgusting yeah for sure whatnot mm-hmm which if you're knew nothing about positive things you know can make for an intense experience but yeah like I said just you know treat it like a pharmaceutical where you just got a great medication and so that's why if you can go into a place you know get a variety you know get seven if I tell them specifically tell the people at the shop what what you're there for what are you there for depression either for anxiety there for physical pain are you there you need something to wake you up in the morning do you want something that makes you talkative wake up in the morning there are ones you know that are that are helpful for that but really be functional though if you smoke in the morning some people yes I have met people who are but they look like I said you have you smoking the right stuff if you're not talking the right stuff then it's a vineyard then you're gonna you know who then it's uh even you don't know what's gonna happen you know what I mean and so it's like you got a trying medication you know if you like it yeah you got a right on it what is this good for is it's good for lazy nabo is it good for sleeping is it good for getting the dishes done is it good for you know taking the trash out you know is it good for taking a nap you know whatever you need help with like that's what having a medication for and if you like it so much that you use it all the time and you need more well good thing you know the place down the street has you know more of it and ability and Mitch's everything like multitasking you know totally gives your body and your mind I got something like forty something kills way more double what I normally get I was just like on fire more so I was a lot more I was making more like cognitive functions per minute you know and being able to correspondingly you know control you know my unit you know my champion in that game I think you're in a flow state right exactly that's otherwise right and so I mean so it's a bit of actually challenging yeah enjoyment yeah but I put I mean but also it's really like you said where is your mind is your mind I've taken a nap you're right dad rocking at the booty game is your mind [Music]", "ed1bNpaNbNg": "I'd like to tell everybody tonight about a little item I found that the local dispensary and it's called Chilam oh gee it's a glass tube that's pinched a little bit and see pinched a little at one end then just continues out in a straight line to exit and what I discovered by hit-and-miss is if you take a filter that you can find these very commonly anywhere on the Internet this is the size I found and I'll take a little and cut it so that there's a cut it like maybe two-thirds through the diameter this is difficult I've never done this before and then you can shape it into a cone I'll try to do that and stay in focus maybe fold it a quarter of the way over and give it some disciplining pinches here and there doesn't have to be perfect and you can actually take this if you want and you can take a like the tip of a paintbrush I'm using and you can force this down into the notch and it fits well enough to stay there I don't and if you can see that it's forming a little cup a little Sybil's and what this does it allows a consumer to consume a very small amount of cannabis very quickly and usually with a very good effect I wanted to get to the back end of things and the diameter of this is such that you can take again a commonly obtained cigarette filter and you can insert the cigarette filter on the other side so you've got your cigarette filter there and I'll just turn this over and you've got a screen there as far as the type of metal and whatever arises from the keep that is given to the screen and the cannabis that that's kind of up to your own decision-making and comfort zone okay so there you have it and you can I'm sure everybody out there has got a better way of loading up here and I just wanted to show that this I've never done this before so I can't really get me in the picture here but I'm putting them you can just barely see putting the and so on and then you can pack it in again with I've got some you can see how little I kind of wanted to get everybody's attention to see how little actual cannabis that you you know pull it back that you're actually taking in you're that's that's not a really great amount I would roughly estimate it's about half of a conventional bowl but I'm not a really long time user so don't take that one too seriously okay and so you probably", "5VtO5QZKo58": "[Music] today we're going to show you about canister grinders and why it's good to spend the extra buck on a badass grinder but then we have semilla Delft we're gonna talk about ill adults and why it's good to spend the extra money and get some good quality but nothing like sobs badass water-pipe we're gonna get back to that one too I'm gonna tell you about the sob sob rigs with titanium nails we'll get back to all that stuff first I'd like to show you about the Switchback pipes that we have here on every five calm beautiful colors the blue the greens the oranges we have about 300 different colors and varieties on every five Calm first for my demonstration I have a 20 pound cinderblock that I'm going to lay right on top of this pipe right here just like that I'm gonna lay a 20 pound cinderblock and this set this right here is 60 pounds hovering aboard hovering right above this right here and I'm going to show you I'm going to place it down on top of it later on and show you you know different variations of weights that it can handle look at the colors on these pipes absolutely beautiful for this demo I'm going to take this 30 pound cinderblock and this is not made out of plastic this is some heavy [ __ ] right here and I'm gonna place it right on top of this just like that but that's not all because I'm going to take sixty pounds this is thirty right here thirty pounds I'm just gonna play see just like that just like that I don't have another cinderblock right here but each this one right here I'm gonna place this one", "PMTMyJinVJo": "[Music] there are a lot of fruits and vegetables that you can turn into a pipe pretty easily but one of the best ones is a carrot for whatever reason the flesh of a carrot is really perfect for bold piece material and what we're gonna make today is a carrot chilling when you're selecting a carrot you want to make sure that it's decently thick and that you can yeah I mean actually that's the only consideration so the first step is I'm gonna take this little paring knife and just cut off the end and the bold piece is gonna go on this end and in fact I'm gonna just gonna mark that right now by putting my knife right in the middle there and starting to just drill a little bit of a hole there and then we're gonna cut it to about where we want to hit it from let's say right there so let's just cut that off and what we want to do is create another mark right there this is our mouth piece we're gonna Whittle it down a little bit more so that's something that fits a little better on your mouth and what I'm gonna do is take this bamboo skewer and I'm gonna stick it into one end of the carrot and I'm gonna drill all the way through and out the other end just hammer this guy down a little bit just push it in and it pulls all the way through and we've got our bolt beast drilled in right there what I'm gonna do now is whittle down this end just a little bit and that way it's gonna fit a little nicer here we go you can like carve your initials into it like in a tree now everybody knows that this is my carrot chillin right here so what I'm gonna do is take some weed there we go [Music] it's perfectly a carrot makes for a great reusable vegetable pipe give it a try", "i5op8PFQ1lY": "[Music] [Music] to me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] baby you got

anybody it doesn't know between 19 whenever it was and now what were you up to I know old but what I produced amount of Jimi Hendrix for over two years and particle we were Jimmy about a year before he died when battening and had my own label and producer manager bankroll slate for 12 years remember it well Alan price let me ask you your show on the West End our Broadway sort of thing in London is now closed it came up in January I think called handicap based on the strip cartoon that was on for a year and I wrote a film soundtrack oh lucky man and a couple of other things let me run about here in in the back what were you up to all these are you you left us did you work as a drummer no I work for chance as a sort of well-paid friend a well-paid friend no less and what were you doing all this time well became a Buddhist man I know they say this is the mystery man you lived it you moved to LA though yeah lived in LA or seven years nice to have you with are you glad to be back together again yeah excuse me chance I got a yeah yeah it's a big one isn't they whose whose idea was it to put the original animals together one more time and nobody will cop to it nobody nobody wants to confess it's a mystery is it a permanent gathering do you think will you do more I mean when you continue to travel well we're scheduled to do a live album as well as a studio album and we live day to day so we'll take it from there we don't know it's nice to have you back gentlemen ladies and gentlemen the animals here's the fifth [Applause]", "NmUcnJecRis": "hey what's going on guys it's Tim Walker thank you very much for joining me today we're just gonna do a quick video on how to make a Sherlock pipe out of a carrot stuff so let's get right to it first thing you're gonna need is a carrot obviously I have this carrot stuff that I have in the fridge so I'm just gonna use that I'm gonna try to build it in the top part of the carrot cuz I'm not sure if I'm gonna need to restart you the bottom stuff so I'm just gonna get right to it and start hollowing out this carrot light bulb I mean any typical vegetable peeler you're gonna have a end that's used to take out the eyes of potatoes or gouge stuff out of slightly rock vegetables I'm just gonna get started with that so I've got a nice little gouge started right there that's gonna pretty much be the entire size of the bowl I want to make sure that the walls of the pipe are still pretty thick because I'm going to use the og Chilam for my coke : don't use plastic or a pen or a marker or anything like that unless the pen is metal if you use something that's not metal that's probably gonna melt and you apply the heat to it and then you'll be inhaling plastic fumes which nobody wants so anyways I'm just gonna take these scissors and kind of even out the ball here just like I did in the last carrot quick video Millie if one of the walls a little bit thicker it's just going to give me a little bit of extra room when I go to put the OT Chilam in as the toko so we've done this carrot bowl going on right there now I'm just gonna try to insert this at an angle probably right about right about there somewhere it's probably where it's gonna be best you're gonna want to make sure you start high enough up by the time the stem gets into the bowl apart it's not too far down into the care they dig way down because it's gonna be hard to hit with a lighter in that case we're gonna do a really vague hole just a little bit smaller than the actual diameter of the chilla hopefully that'll give us a pretty nice seal be really careful here or you're probably gonna have to start over this is uh seems to be pretty delicate work I should probably do it you know something that looks just a little bit like that not too bad and the moment of truth I'm gonna take this over each other I'm gonna stick it in that hole of nice angle there you have it it's a nice carry play now this was obviously a really fast and easy version of the carrot fight you're not gonna need to do too much work if you luck out and you happen to have something like this Oh be chillin here or some other kind of metal stem body airway so anyways um let's jimsonweed in there and see how she works now I'm not gonna break it this week too much because some action will screen on the Chilam so I'm just gonna break it up a little bit just enough so it burns nicely and I guess we'll just give it a shot they have guys the carrot pipe part to Sherlock style I'd say quite a little bit easier than the original carrot fight but let's just see how she smokes before we make any quick judgment calls here yeah I don't want to say guys this is version of the carrot pipe really kicks the other ones ass this is definitely the way to go yeah this is pretty awesome I could definitely see making this like if I was out camping if I didn't have a pipe on hand even if you didn't have the Chilam on hand you can always use like like I was saying you could always use a reed that you find in the woods a lot of a lot of plants have a hollow stem you can just crack off and use that as a stick and you'd be good to go although I don't know why you'd have a bag of weed and not have any means to smoke it but this is always an option for you if that ever comes up now again the one drawback with a carrot pipe is because the carrots so watery inside a lot of the weed gets kind of wet and doesn't really burn properly so it actually is a little bit more difficult to like finish off the bowl properly gross you know what this quite reminds me of this sort of level of Stella no part you know what they look like you know this pipe reminds the other it's like one of those old-school corncob pipes see see old men smoking or sitting on the rocking chair it's got kind of a nice feel to it to be honest unfortunately it's a carrot so it's not like you can take this with you and use it more than once but but it's pretty nice alternative to smoking a joint or something like that if you just wanted to throw it down to some friends so I guess let's throw a little bit more reasonable [Music] all right ready guys let's see if I can get this all done in one pull here the bottom of the bowl is getting kind of wet and gnarly in there so we'll see what happens but I'm thinking it'll work out here it's really nice I'm starting to get a little bit of blowback here some chunks flying through the tube but not that many to be honest I'm a little surprised there weren't more so anyways I guess we'll just close it off with a review of the Sherlock style carrot stuff fight I'd say probably the content out of 10 I mean it's really easy to make obviously and as long as you have this here oh gee Chilam you can just whip one up in a matter of seconds really the one drawback I was talking about where your weed gets kind of wet because the carrot juice really salt itself once you start to apply fire to it it really dries it out obviously so that's not really a problem at all you guys want to know a little bit more about the OG Chilam you can check out my review of that right here I'll post a link I guess that's it don't forget to Like comment share subscribe send it to a friend each of vegetables all that good [ __ ] and I guess I'll see you guys later [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "XmeoX7zU_ZU": "[Music] I know

India well we're all packed up [Music] I can cry mrs. place we are heading to another ashram that's located in the jungles just outside of Gwalior we've been staying in this jungle ashram for about a week with this Baba called sharm sunder das baba humps honored us baba is this guy that is liberated in the sense of like a Buddha he's a Buddha and he's been meditating in caves and he's been just doing this true spiritual work for the last like 30 years he's what we called the real deal [Music] in India they touched the feet of saints they pranaam bow down and they touch the feet of these people as sort of a recognition that they walked the path a recognition that this person is a reflection of our inner divinity a reflection of our divine potential touching their feet is a way to surrender [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sona baba the guy with the long hair yeah every day he would try to give me a smoke with him today was special because we were heading to an ancient temple that is maybe another hour into the jungle we're like three hours into the jungle at this point when we arrived here the sona Baba asked me to drive with him I was like okay fine you know I'll leave my little my comfort zone of my group of friends and I'll Drive with this with this guy plus I was like I could get down with some hash right now I'm we're going to this ancient temple in the jungle maybe it'll enhance the experience it'll allow me to tune in to this to this moment more it was just us in this other guy and they whipped out this pipe and I was like okay yeah why not why not the power of why not well we were heading to this temple not only to just bathe in the beauty of this magnificent place in the middle of nowhere but the Baba wanted to give us spiritual names it's an honor and a real privilege to get a name from a saint or from a guru hike down this thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's nice this temple is built around this cave and this cave had a real deep tunnel into it and these Yogi's would go into the cave and they wouldn't come back out and so it developed this legend that this cave is the entrance into the underworld so nur Baba grabs my hand and he's like come on we're gonna go we're gonna go we're gonna climb and we climb to the top of this temple maybe it's seven stories or something like that we're gonna climb up this climb climb climb Jay okay guru Buddha guru better move without your mother Billy man I love the man Baba good not even good Nadi so I walk in and the first thing that happens is just a swarm of bats just start flying everywhere and I'm just like oh okay yeah of course of course there's bats [Music] oh yeah I put it oh come in look up for the bets oh yeah it's uh oh boy oh boy oh yeah [Music] do you dip it Nikita [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hopefully calm [Music] every day I spent with the Baba he would say to me tomorrow I give you an an Indian name I give you a spiritual name tomorrow and then tomorrow would come and he goes your nam tomorrow tomorrow at one point I was joking with him I was like okay Baba my spiritual name is tomorrow but after we were exploring around climbed to the top of this temple and just you know got my adventure fix the Baba sat us all down there's a group of us here he sits us down he's sharing stories and he is just talking and randomly he looks at my friend Michael and he goes your name hottie das and then he looks at me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is the data Guinness is the giver of all the cities even poverty son this is the data he gives all the cities he distributes [Music] so he gave me the name Ganesh Das Ganesh Ganesh like the elephant god Ganesh Dossett and he also gave me the name Kali das and he said you choose ganesh does Kali Joss and I think I'm not choosing Bob well this isn't my choice this isn't for me to choose I don't get to pick my spiritual name the whole this is you know and he's he's sat there for a second and he goes Ganesh is a good name Ganesh das is a good name okay Ganesh das it is but I want you to give me your favorite name of Ganesh because these gods have tons of different names like Krishna has Krishna Govinda Mohan Gopala there's a bunch of different names that represent the one so he gave me the name gudgeon none gudgeon none das gudgeon done means the one with the elephant head who holds the entire universe inside of him and das means like servant of servants of Ganesh Ganesh is the the remover of obstacles my mom is going through a rough time right now just going through a divorce she just lost her mom my grandma just passed away my grandpa is not doing so well and so my mom is in this sort of tidal wave of truth she's really experiencing reality the the grips that reality has on us you know we so much and so often live in this realm of illusion that were attached to this illusion of permanence that things are going to stay you know we link our moments up in a chain and don't realize that you know at any second this there is no chain we're not really connected to anything and any second anything can happen so naturally I was like mom what do you I'm gonna bring you home from India I'll get you a gift whatever you want and she goes oh you just bring me home a little Ganesh and I told the Baba this and he just looked at me and smiled and then at this point I'm just sitting with the Baba just me and him and a couple of other sad news and Indian people all the other everyone else is getting ready to leave and I'm just kind of sitting there you know maybe looking through the photos I take in and he goes my gudgeon and us you throw a party for because he gave me a name like I'm gonna throw a party now because I'm you know finally on the path or whatever reason you know and yeah Bob I'll throw a party sure I'll get home I throw a party he goes no no no we don't throw a party now and then all the Indians in the place just started cheering and clapping and it was a real it was really special it was really special time so we left the ancient temple and went back to the normal temple that the jungle Baba stays at shops under dusty is that and we just did this sort of routine of singing songs doing kirtan singing to Rama and Sita or Shiva or Krishna and we're just talking about philosophy what happens when we die is does the individual soul exist I asked all sorts of questions to him and I'll upload some more footage of me asking him questions and just other footage in general in a comming video but then he would just feed us we would just go eat food and then we would take a nap it was like a yogi daycare [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

one-hitter and all the practice device we have a practice device to show you this will up build up your strength and your dexterity what I did is I take a piece of seven mill taped a piece of string on there and then hung a weight on it maybe like a double-a batteries but to get size weight and this will help you a whole bunch and then notice how it lines up in my hand here and I spin it see how this rod is lined up with your knuckles you should stay just like that and then this is your pivot point between here and here is where the rod should be pivoting in there and use this as your power and this is your pivot okay you got that roll it down and don't let it just fall down you got to let it down with your fingers try to use all your fingers let down use all your fingers bring it back up and then try to go a couple rolls down a couple of rules up a couple rolls down a couple of rolls up nice little exercise device you'll love it but cats make the one we already did this one typically ever done okay so let's pull this part off to here mean it anymore honey up I'm going to show you the parts that mattered about a one-hitter which is the constriction and opening the front so come in here all you have to do is heat the glass push in slightly when it gets real molten and it'll gather up just like that give a little puff that is perfect okay open the front pick the front open now before it gets don't melt the whole bunch you stuff in here just barely melt it and flare it at the same time if you let too much material melt it'll make this big molten down it on there and it'll get all crazy on you says heat it up slightly flare it heat it up slightly again flare it heat it up slightly again all this gathering the glass here to make it thick make a nice controlled little thick donut there on the end not one that's all out of control and that's it that's all there really is to making a one you guys know how to take it off the to pick the hole and all that stuff so let's introduce try it and let him get some parts time hello Brian what's going on guys how you guys doing this to that viewers I'm sure they're all doing good once you get there on the torch you

all that here's some formula there he's ready to pick the hole he's gonna do this the first time he I gave him up wait about five minutes worth of lessons or something on that we're gonna spin both up when you get it in the flip it really the most crucial thing to pick in the hole it's getting the angles right it needs to be at a 45 degree angle okay don't remember when you get to us to turn up oh he's gonna try and pull it off let's get up close get close okay try another piece of four mil I think if the cameras gonna die if it does just have a good heart bet or not oh look how thin you got you can pull that little cap off there so close you got the can you up you learned when I taught you though sure Stan and Stan's have to pull it out don't heat anymore if it up heat as little as you can to the to hit it with the formula spin it off quick you're gonna run out of tube yeah here let me oh I guess when you guys are picking a hole try a smaller flame more of a pin or flame you might be able to get it we'll see if that helps pray okay try that one right so close hitting you made a little bit of stringer there get rid of that thing okay busted blob off there come on people at home

dogs so fostering is about taking in a dog and preventing the dog to end up in kennels so you're freeing up spaces in kennels and preventing the dog to end up in the first place and also you are allowing the dog to come into your home and you're gonna be looking after the dog wise is in your home you're gonna link with the rescue so they're gonna be there every step of the way is teamwork a lot of effort hard work to all get together in the interest of the dog so you're gonna help the dog rehabilitate the dog and then the dog is gonna be ready to go so you also gonna be able to say goodbye to the dog so letting go is part of the process of fostering as well otherwise you're gonna end up with 100 dogs you cannot adopt lots of dogs but you can foster a lot of dogs so how i got into fostering i had an english bulldog and unfortunately he died last year in september and then after that i decided i wanted to help some dog in needs not all dogs who come into foster they've been to horrible situation or to neglect so they'll be malnourished or treated very badly they can come from loving home but whatever the scenarios wherever they're coming from you have to just remember you're starting from fresh with that dog you don't know the dog much when they come through just take it easy and just help the dog you're there for them and that's what i wanted to do i wanted to be there for a dog in need and that's why i decided to go into it i decided to do it for a specific breed so i did my research around rescues only to english bulldogs and now i'm a volunteer for them is so far i only had a couple of dogs coming through but it was an amazing experience from beginning to end and that's why i suggest for everybody to ever go or try and if you're interested you know you can help dogs who are really in need and there are a lot of dogs so some rescue have keno's as well as foster homes some only have foster homes and no kennels in terms of suitability how do you go about registering search online look at the sort of breed you are interested in to look after and to foster if you want to go for a general you know for any dog any sort of breeds you can look at the local rescue otherwise you can look at more specific grades and then just go from there make your inquiries every rescue has different criterias in terms of registration and now the practice and the sort of support that you're gonna have and you will explain everything while you get your inquiry going basically and it's like that's the starting process of it uh what do you need to become a foster you need time you need lots of patience you need a warm home and lots of love to give to these dogs once they come through and you're gonna have the dog with you you're gonna attend to them on the daily basis so the sort of stuff that you are expected to do with the dogs is what you're going to be doing with your dog anyway which is like obviously feeding them providing water all the time making sure that they've got a warm place to sleep comfortable and then you are going to be in charge of taking them back and forward to the vet as well so the transporting to the different appointments it could only be a few appointments it depends on the health of the dog or it can be a lot of appointments it can be more demanding if the dog needs to do physiotherapy if they do need to do either therapy but it can only be you know to do with vaccination neutering and maybe you're going to be administering basic medications or flea warming tablets this is the sort of stuff the generally you know respecting to do as a foster when the dogs are with you the other part which is a very important part is that you're not expected to be a dog the everest but at the same time you need to teach these dogs the basic skills amazing skills to try in life so they can have a forever home and they can be more adoptable and that's what is the beauty in foster because you are giving this dog the one to one which are going to allow them to recover perhaps from from neglect from illness and whatever the situation they come from or again they can come like i said before you know from a loving family you can just help them to move on and turn in you know that transition you're gonna pay a key role to help them to go to the forever room so basic skills for instance house training very very important and then from there look if there is any challenging behaviors instead start working with what can be changed so is there any chewing nipping and feet or unwanted behavior how to greet people walking on the leash the pooling recall and you know maybe when they are ready to be re-owned they will not be you know hundred percent on any of those things yet but still you're playing a big role and you may already you're starting the journey for the dog to to have a forever room and to be better placed you know in in the future in terms of like the positive of uh fostering there are a lot of positive and positive um sides to it first of all you're gonna have lots of dogs coming with different personalities you will have lots of fun free exercise you'll be spending lots of time with them it's gonna be companionship for you you're gonna play you're gonna have your children involved if you have children and you can have your resident dog you know socializing with the other dog and the other doctor absolutely is a shy dog that can help as well and then you're gonna build up lots of memories is very um rewarding because you're just gonna feel really empowered when the dog leaves knowing they just teach them stuff even while you're going through the journey every time they learn something you will feel so great about it you will feel like wow i've done that i'm able to change this dog life and improve the life and the ability for them to be adopted um the negative side of it it's that unfortunately those dogs will have to leave you're gonna feel a sense of guilt and that's really bad at the very beginning when they're just ready to go you're just gonna feel like oh my gosh i'm abandoning them again but that's not the case think about all the positive stuff that you've done for the dog and think about the new home they're gonna have a forever home now people who love them and you help them to get there so that's why you have to look at you know in a positive way to go forward the negative could be that unfortunately some dogs but this is very rare in most cases the rescue will support you will support the dog physically if they need rehabilitation as well as in terms of behavior issues to make it better but if the t is really so damaged and it cannot be done you know anything for the dog anymore unfortunately you would have to be the one as well to take the dog and be put down but that's very very you know rare most in most situations they don't do well and they move on to their adoptable and forever homes in terms of um stuff that you need in your house to be prepared to do fostering if you obviously had your own dog before it would be easier if you have left you know like a mattress to use blankets baby stuff for the food and the water containers um an area where you can obviously put the dog if you are leaving the dog unattended if you need to leave the house a few hours um to have perhaps a baby gate but if you don't have stuff don't worry about it speak to the rescue and they will be able to support you don't think i'm not suitable because i have my own resident dog i'm not suitable because i live miles away from the rescue i'm not suitable because i have children don't think like that you can potentially be suitable if you have children if you have your own resident talk and actually those can be you know families that they actually needed for the rescue for dogs to come in because a lot of dogs do well and they come from loving over their head you know they've been surrounded by children already or there is a resident dog already and they will do really well with dogs around them and the fact that you live far away it doesn't matter because the the rescue for resistance i support is you know three hours away from where i live but they have volunteers who do the transporting if they need to move dogs from an area to another there are ways around that and actually more homes that are available the more foster rooms that are available for those dogs less dogs are going to end up in kennels and more dogs are going to have a better chance to be adopted and that's what you're trying to do when you do fostering allowing these dogs to come through help them give them basic needs you know just go with whatever you can do for the dog so very very important you're going to need time you're going to need patience you're going to need lots of love and affection for those dogs you're going to need boundaries and rules to be put in place try and have a routine in place a good structure for a dog so that they can really do well while they are with you and then the the exercise and the playing time with them and just go every day at the time the rescue will help you the rescue normally covers as well the bill costs in terms of the vets and sometimes you know the food as well but advice from rescue to rescue so make sure you check with the rescue you decide to go for good luck everyone if you decide to foster is really great thank you for listening and i hope that this is giving you a short introduction to what is expected if you become a foster and if you decide to sign up i really appreciate your time and your interest in the welfare for homeless dogs thank you very much", "4ACwD9IWt3E": "[Laughter] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so

doesn't give me enough function for me to get a nice little hit uh it does hit but it hits four little hits basically like if you're trying to hide something for somebody this is something that you just buzz doubted it you know that's it but I mean personally my purse my perfect personal opinion I like I like pieces that have carbs knowing that I'm gonna get a nice decent hand knowing that it's

this graph labs Chilam so without further ado let's hop right into the review so we got this graph labs Chilam here and the one thing that i did like about this particular thing right off the bat was what it was made of it's made with Baro glass the for us to look at Pyrex glass so you don't have to worry about this basically shattering under extreme temperatures so we did want to hit this with a torch or something you wouldn't have to worry about that so that is one thing you get right off the bat that is nice about this is what's made with and grabbed labs makes about medium medium grade glass I'd say not high-end not low-end for sure but probably medium grade glass it's more of an industrial type of look to it which is something similar to this which is kind of more scientific or industrial in regards to the way the chilla is not heavy at all and it does have a very industrial look to it not much fanciness on it which is nice sometimes it's nice to get a nice plain glass piece we have here grav labs is etched in there as you can see right here and it's basically the inverse edging which allows you to have the smoother part be the actual logo and the etched part be the background and then on the inside here we can see our nice little double pinch all the way through and see it goes to like a nice little hourglass right there this is going to be the end where you're gonna put your material that you're smoking right here and you do have a nice long straw part from where the actual Bowl is so where the mouthpiece is you don't to worry about that getting too hot so you can definitely use this for multiple uses but I haven't worried about it getting too hot again your you're dealing with burro glass here so it's gonna be really easy to clean it's not gonna stain that's another big thing to at the borer glasses it doesn't stain a lot of the times you'll get resin buildup especially on something like this which probably wouldn't get cleaned that off then you get resin buildup on it and it eventually will discolor the glass this will look like the day that you bought it as long as you clean it with some like isopropanol or some kind of a solvent that's going to get anything this after class should make it look exactly like this so that's a little plus in this and this was on the economical side we're talking ten bucks here for a nice little chillin like this that's retail that's how much you would pay if you were to look this up on the internet and go find it yourself but you have about ten bucks pretty nice little chillin here definitely something that's a nice price point for a throwaway piece or something that you might want to keep in your arsenal for daily use or even occasional use so I like this if you like chums let us know in the comments below if you like grab labs as a glass maker or glass blower let us know in the comments below as well if you've had any other products just shoot us up so comments down there and let us know how your experience was with them like this video give it a thumbs up what more content like this subscribe for more we do smoking reviews every single Monday so be on the lookout for that and have a great rest your day", "t01sJXFo8XY": "All right YouTube, here it is, the ultimate\npipe cleaning guide. No mess, no bags, no microwave, no boiling on the stove, nothing like that. Very simple, very effective. I really like this method. uh... First you want to seal off the bowl, and any other holes that might be on the pipe like carbs, or anything like that. I'm using electrical\ntape. You don't have to but it works very well, it doesn't leak if you wrap it correctly, and most people have it laying around... but I've used plastic wrap in the past and other things... but anyway, you want to completely seal off the\npipe like i'm doing here. I'm going to speed it up just a bit here... and next we're going to grab some kosher salt. (just press that in and make sure\neverything is all sealed off) I'm going to use kosher salt here, you don't have to. If you just have regular salt you can use that too, but kosher salt is a more effective scrubbing agent. You don't want it completely\npacked full, you want room for your solvent as well, which we'll add in a second... If you end up with too much salt in there just knock a bit of it back out. I'm using 100% pure acetone.\nYou can also use nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol, but pure acetone is the best, it work like magic. As with the salt, you don't want it completely full of acetone. You want some air in there, maybe about twenty percent. You want your cleaning solution to be able to move freely and move around... so leave a little air in there. We're going to finish sealing off the pipe. Make sure it's completely sealed up, and tight. And then you're going to shake, shake, shake, shake! If you clean your pipe on a regular basis you can get away with two or three minutes, and it will be clean. If it's REALLY funky, I've had to shake up to ten minutes. It just depends on how much use the pipe has gotten. Shake shake shake! also I just want to make a little note: I've seen a lot of videos here on YouTube where people are putting alcohol and salt into a bag and they're kind of missing the point. The\npoint of the salt is that it doesn't dissolve in the solvent and remains a good scrubbing agent. You want that on the inside of the pipe That's why I like to sealing it off like I do in this method. ... also you'll notice I already had the water running before I rinse it out, because you want it to be nice and hot when you use it first, you don't want to wait for it to heat up. I'm going to manually scrub out the bowl here because you'll usually have a couple little bits and pieces left in there, it doesn't get a lot of flow... but the insides are already perfect. I'm going to give it one little quick rinse here with acetone, one more time, just to get rid of anything that may have redeposited on the inside of the pipe when I put the water in there. Give it one more hot water rinse, make sure you have all the residue out and it is just clean water. Dry it off. I'm going to bring it back over to the light source so you can see how we did... BOOM! Clean pipe, like the day it was blown.", "eOAGQEdfIrc": "[Music] they're going to show you how to clean your one-hitter chill them or other glassware so as you can see they get gummed up after many uses and are not very pleasant to smoke through so start will together our ingredients need to gather some pipe cleaners and these are the time to have the hard bristle to them some q-tips some paper towels a ziplock or other storage container some 91% isopropyl alcohol and some epsom salts once you gather all those together let's mix them into a little baggie and as you see I've already done this here that's assault and the 91% isopropyl alcohol together next we want to take our one-hitter and simply drop it in there well do the same with the channel we want to make sure that there's nothing inside the Chilam are your one-hitter before you insert it into the bag and I'm going to be trying to be careful here so I don't bang the two up two gifts each other and possibly break the chilla and finally we're gonna put one more one-hitter in here one note of caution as you can see this one-hitter has a little bit different coloration this one-hitter used it's 100 used to have markings on it emitted like a cigarette rubbing alcohol or 91% isopropyl alcohol may discolor your one-hitter if it has that on it as also a side note karma suta khals or its affiliates are not responsible for any damage to your glassware after you put it on here let's shake it around a little bit carefully and gently if you have more than one item in here and as you see the water is already starting to turn nasty so i'm gonna sit it down and i'm going to want to try to make sure everything is still completely covered as much as possible and now we're gonna let this sit for at least fifteen to thirty minutes if not longer it would help to zip zip lock so it doesn't spill [Music] as you can see as I moved the bag so in the brown stuff from the gunk pill top starts to come off it's been about 45 minutes or so and now let's take it out of the bag and just run run a little clean water through it help get rid of that excess Epsom salt and isopropyl alcohol okay we have just rinsed our Chilam and one-hitters off next we're gonna take our paper towel and we're just gonna wipe I'm gonna ball it up just a little bit I'm sticking in here and just try to wipe some of this off glass normally cleans very very easily and as you can see just all the gunk on the paper towel there next I'm with a q-tip and just try to get some of the other gunk out of here and you're going to want to keep working on it till you get to your desired level of cleanliness this is also time you take your pipe cleaner and if you look you see some of the gunk built up here and just take it to help clean it some so we'll continue to do this until it's clean now as you can see I've spent a couple minutes just cleaning it with a q-tip and a um pipe cleaner and as you can see it is much much cleaner now and suitable for use next to clean your one-hitter it's a little more difficult because you don't have as much space just where I highly recommend q-tips and just gonna turn them around there and after letting it soak for a while you see how much gunk comes off [Music] if you need to take a little cup of rubbing alcohol or even what's already in your bag the q-tip in it just to help give it a little more moisture and cleaning power to the q-tip while still containing some gunk inside it is much easier to smoke from now question is about what level do you want to stop cleaning in that's all personal preference you can clean it to looks like it's brand-new again but that will take some elbow grease with a little rubbing alcohol q-tips again the longer you soak it the easier it is to clean these have been soaking for about 45 minutes I've left some metal one-hitters which this is inside the solution for overnight and it was much easier to clean it's really personal preference now as you can see after a little bit of elbow grease we have some very clean one-hitters and a chill I'm ready to smoke so I'm gonna take a little alien OG from karma suta khals load it right into my one-hitter and it's time to take the puff [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Pn32LEC7ydI": "Oh the question is did this prehistoric killing machine die out along with the dinosaurs or could its fearsome form still be cruising our

really could not my to delete that might have been the largely difference so let me catch this real quick before I get started so um actually I'm just gonna close out [ __ ] I'm feeling joking one second nice a clean play this one week [ __ ] is already getting dirty filthy what the [ __ ] Oh cleaner out so this is the hot box blog for just the hot box um this weekend I got some special guests showing up sorry I I was looking at that but the cameras right there so I got some special guests coming up and my special guess I just need some of my friends but and i'm assuming just right now by talking there's someone that will see this eventually I'm not I know right now on youtube I got a bunch of videos and like [ __ ] novias but whatever you know maybe he'll catch on I'm just doing this for fun just doing this for me just cuz I feel like it oh yeah get that oh my god just just get all you get a little bit ball ah no don't spill dude god damn it alright so this is the only problem with me and packing weed and the reason I can't roll I had cancer when I was 16 bone cancer Ewing sarcoma bad [ __ ] um better now next year I'll be in my 10 years it's all be cured but uh my right dominant hand I mean look at this [ __ ] look I can't close my fingers like okay you see this like they want and yeah so it leads to pot everywhere just everywhere but the good part about that is when I'm running low on bud I can I just brushed off in the car and I keep my car relatively clean so I brush it off we'll find it later sometimes they can find it not that's the best feeling in the world when you're looking for it and you're like God I don't got any money until next week but I just gotta do something to get through today [ __ ] find a nug in your garden what's our [ __ ] out of it alright so oh pardon me so what bi smoking on today well oh the reason was being a video I said all I had a have YouTube red and I have music on it and it plays in the background but apparently doesn't play when you're recording by the way super convenient um if you have a dog or whatever surest oh by the way sir esto works [ __ ] fantast months that's not a product placement so this is what we'd be smoking on oh oh this is some Alabama dream I think which is some blue dream and alabama kush but it leans more towards the alabama kush side blue dream is a lot more dense than that but um unfortunately right now i have it on the front facing camera so i can't really give you that much detail of it but it is a co focus if I put my hand focus on some good [ __ ] it's really crystally it's got like little yeah they're just everywhere huh here's a piece hopefully you guys can see this now this is white the stem is white on this one but that's all the crystals so if you guys can kindan sorry dark anyways but it's pretty [ __ ] good at you my uh it's ridiculous not some of the best i've had but a pretty [ __ ] good tasting and i'm pretty sure this is Earth grow although most earth groans Tim have like darker colors excuse me while I huh stroke while trying to put this cap back on this airtight container oh yeah by the way this container is automatically sealed because it is by a bigger people that make aspirin so keeps smelling very useful especially if you have to spend eighty dollars on that or in my case I got it on sale at petsmart shout at petsmart for 65 bucks but that's for eight months so less than ten bucks a month and I can reuse the case alright well cheers guys oh that first hit morning god damn every [ __ ] time I'm not actually hotboxing this morning so in my car down beautiful park if the other video hasn't come out in this is this will be hot box two instead of three I was here same place for that one but um yeah no one comes down here really and it's just it's down out of the way off the road it was a little dirt road going to it and it's really I love this time of year because all the leaves have fallen off and it just it looks like fall you know with all the like the gray looking like leafless trees it's really cool but um so something weird to happen yesterday oh I went to a gas station yeah I guess okay so this is gonna sound even more suspicious but you know I was like [ __ ] I'll give it a try because where I live it isn't technically illegal for everybody it but uh if any of you guys know what this is it is Oh focus just chill CBD oil and it comes in little piggy by with it even after this is jungle juice flavor but I came I picked it up at a gas station and it says it's CBD oil it says the only ingredients are CBD oil VG which is vegetable glycerin which is used in any bait it's just a thickener into the filler for it to get it to bait and artificial flavoring for the suppose it blueberries raspberries apples pine apples oranges yeah I honestly it doesn't taste me but my mouth might just be and gone to [ __ ] and not be able to pick that up because I smoke so often but um ya know before um there was no one else in there and it was just me and this guy talking and I'm like dude is that actual CBD oil and he was a yam and it is no Mike I've always wanted to try that because you know from the cancer I have an amputation which this last October I just had to have my leg shortened another four and a half inches so I'm basically just almost a year out of out of that and by last October yeah not this previous October but the one before that and so it's just been a year first year when you get a new mutation is just [ __ ] awful but I'm doing good can't complain you know I could be dead or you know I could actually be crippled or something but anyways we were talking I told him you know I got that knee pain even when I smoke it doesn't really take care of it it just kind of how do I say this it doesn't so much take care of it it just makes you ignore it whereas something like tram at all which is an SSRI and reliever that helps me amazingly come on neurontin which is gabapentin for nerve pain so if you got nerve pain that's perfect for that I mean advil we just doesn't do the same thing as those do for me and it never has and it's kind of disappointed me but you know I'm not gonna knock that it has medicinal properties it helps with my it helps so much more with my anxiety than anything they've given me helps more than you know One Bowl of this helps more than xanax or ativan or klonopin clonazepam whatever you want to call it but um so I saw a CBD oil and I was like [ __ ] everybody says that's like supposed to be the [ __ ] well he says he has to leave he has to let you try it and you have to wait like five minutes before you um can really feel it because that'll be heading towards the peak of it at 10 minutes I think so about two minutes you started feeling 10 minutes you should be a peek but um yes it's just it's just a vape pen um didn't taste like anything didn't feel anything in my lungs it felt like 0 mg they blew it which is a vaporizer or e-cig fluid without any nicotine the nicotine for people like me who don't smoke or have like radiated my lungs at radiation so I have sensitive lungs which makes smoking a problem but interesting side story real quick the more i smoke the less i cough once i've smoked one bowl and I've like cough my lungs up and [ __ ] I like stop coughing it's it's the greatest [ __ ] thing ever so after I get after i get baked i can just smoke as much as I want and just not even give a [ __ ] anymore but uh I always feel like an like a little [ __ ] cuz people pass me the blood and i'll hit it and i'll get a big hit but you know I'll choke for like five minutes but then after that if I just you know chill and drink something and cool off my throat I come back and they're like what the [ __ ] but anyways so yeah it didn't taste like anything it was there was no burn there was no feeling to it it was just paper um so I got my bottle water in my beef jerky and I went out and I just sat in the car you know just having a parking lot with the windows down just chilled and five minutes rolls around and I realized my me and my hip weren't hurting and I was like what the [ __ ] it was amazing so I was like okay so I go back in there and I you know we talk about it some more and i buy it it's stupid expensive for the pen just for the one ml of fluid of CBD oil it's 65 bucks so I was like [ __ ] whatever it helped me and um I get home and you know I look it up online it's just chill products and I look at the graph they have of what it contains and by then I'm starting to feel like a little like lightheaded so I'm like what the [ __ ] that's not more you shouldn't feel a CBD I ever and I was like there's something else in here so i will just say right now I'm not allegedly according to me I might just be sensitive or my anxiety might just be so bad that when I smoke CBD oil that it relaxes me enough to the point where it seems like I'm high because it felt very much like an ativan or a clonazepam for me so that might have just been me I wasn't eat and that's the thing about the placebo effect which is the effect where you give someone you know a pill full of sugar and you tell them that it will you know make their hips up her even they're like oh my god it my hip stopped hurting it's amazing it's just a fake effect but I went into it not expecting it to work I went I expected it to be fake I was like all right this is [ __ ] you know regular weed doesn't help so how is this can help but I'll give it a shot you know it was a free try and it helped but yeah I don't know man I I don't think that graph on their website is very accurate I'll just say that right now I personally got what felt like a pretty heavy buzz from two puffs on when I got home and I had my friend my brother's girlfriend come over and had her try it and she did three puffs on it and she said she didn't feel anything at first but then she said she felt kind of lightheaded weird so I I don't know anyways Cheers Oh whoo sorry I'm just trying to take that in [ __ ] this thing well where are you put in my mom no no that's weird I'll find it but um sorry I was looking for my little quartz crystal one-hitter that looks like cigarette I was gonna say well those types of one hairs or small bowls work great for me personally it's a hot and harsh but and I don't really get a good hit but with this style of chillin pipe whatever you want to call it um I haven't had anybody be very disappointed with this has cost me ten bucks and I was like well you know it's okay it worked it's small enough where I can hide it but it's also very it's very thick as you can see it's very thick all the way around and then this part I don't know if you'd be able to see it the bowl is right here above my finger and then it kind of our glasses and then it goes bigger here but all of this around it that little space in our glass is solid glass so I've dropped this a couple times and nothing's happened and it doesn't get hot the end gets hot the ballpark it's hot but has a really deep Bowl um the only downside is did I just [ __ ] like no I do it was my lighter goddamn I am I out of it already downside of this is it gets dirty very easily very quickly once you see isn't it it's great it looks a lot through before you season it which is you know to be expected of smooth glass or any glass in general metal tends to do a better job because the metal will heat up and kind of melt it together so that that takes care of that I didn't really have to season the quartz crystal one because again it's like the metal it heated up and kind of melted all the residue to it so you don't really get that but this was gross um but this thing hits so [ __ ] hard I don't know how and I don't know why I nobody's been disappointed with it that's for sure so I don't know what it is but just enjoy it and i think i [ __ ] up a little bit because i am totally [ __ ] baked off of two hits because i'm an [ __ ] and decided oh yeah well I'm just gonna I'm gonna take this ad D medication focalin this morning and I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna be productive without the buck but and then I'm like oh yeah I can you know smoke bowl while I'm on my vocal in because you know keeps you awake and you get to experience a lot i sorry I was just staring at the cars going by see how I'm [ __ ] out of it but uh if you want an intense experience take a focal in wait an hour smoke oh oh if you have hard issues I wouldn't try it because focalin speeds up your heart rate interesting fact just because I'm full of useless information and love to hear myself talk um focalin is like dimethyl een something well adderall and Ritalin are impediment salts so this is what I found out in my research of it when he prescribed when my doctor prescribed consuming which it helps it is absolute godsend my burden is so [ __ ] up after all the drugs and buy drugs I mean actual drugs that the hospital had me on like all the chemo all the you know the [ __ ] they inject in you all the painkillers I was on I was 16 and 17 and 18 on 80 milligrams of MS contin which is the hawk oxycontin kind of similar thing but it's morphine morphine sulfate cotton and I was on 80 milligrams twice a day and taking eight milligrams of dilaudid every four hours and taking advil and tylenol at regular intervals to deal with the bone bang and yeah I suffered withdrawal from that because I missed once it'd be one single dose of that ms cotton and I thought I was dying we're stomach pain I've ever felt shaking this is it 17 so keep that in mind I'm already bald and you know fighting cancer and sick from that and then all of a sudden I miss a dose and then the next day I'm just like sweaty and vomiting and throwing it vomiting I was [ __ ] myself too I was throwing up so hard that I started throwing up blood because my stomach lining was coming up and anyways that that tripping that ended in a trip to the hospital where they had to inject me with the lot in every two hours for about Oh half a day and then they kept me and pump me full of fluids because I got dehydrated but uh yeah so all that [ __ ] and then they and I had to go on methadone you know [ __ ] thing but oh yeah so all that [ __ ] kind of [ __ ] with my brain because it turns out when you're going through puberty and you give kids chemo and pain medications even though they need it and it helped and it did what it was supposed to do I don't blame him I don't blame the medicine it worked it's just I wish there had been something better so but um it turns out when you're going through puberty in your brains developing fastest when that [ __ ] happens it [ __ ] with you and I was a straight-a student you know I read a lot after chemo I couldn't focus long enough to read a book I couldn't remember stuff in five minutes ago I it literally felt like I had to mention but um focalin I tried strattera vyvanse Ritalin Adderall and none of it worked and then this one guy this one doctor prescribed me I'm focalin and it worked but uh I don't work for everybody but that's just my story but that's why I researched and turns it up focalin

one hitter and dugout what comes in the package is two different items the first one is the manual that gives you a step-by-step on best uses you can always check simple dot AC / one-hitter for more details second item that comes in the package is the actual one hitter and dugout you can see the one hitter is an innovative knotch different design with a tapered edge and the white ring you have an adjustable slider that tells you how big your hit will be just also have your little convenient poker that is multifaceted now we're gonna show you how to use the product simply take off the cap you put in this tee position you need to put on either side then you take out the one hitter you know which side to load based off of the tapered edge and then also the little edgings the smaller etchings point which side to load you know what's n to smoke out of based off the white ring the simple one hitter is adjustable look at the adjusting slider on the top and you can have between one to four notches this would be a one notch er you could tell by the edge of the slider or you can pull it all the way back for four notch are at point two grams or the one notch are at point o 8 grams to load your product you can do one of two ways you have the stab and twist we just go in and twist the product around that's it or you can do the scrape and drag where you going at a 45 degree angle scrape along the bottom as well after loading your product put your mouth on the blecch with the white ring and then light from this end inhale with the flame over on this side and then when you're done you can simply push the slider all the way to the edge or you can see it coming out and you can use the included poker to ripe off the edge lastly when you need to clean the product maybe you're having a little restricted airflow issue you can just bring the poker in here and make sure to drag it out make sure not to push it in now we're going to show you some of the best tips and tricks to ensure you get the best use after repeated use the slider can sometimes be hard to move the best way to loosen it up simply use the flame heat it up and it will now make the slider way easier to move but that indicates they should probably give it a deep clean and we'll show you later in the video how to do that for different air flows you can load it with a smaller loading size and after you can simply make the size bigger and you'll have more air for the product to flow through for the dugout instead of holding the cap in your hands you can actually use it put it in this T position to ensure that it's a safe and stored in either side and that still allows you to pull out the one header if you find that some of your product gets too stuck down on the bottom you can always loosen it up and stir it up using the included poker if you're in a pinch you don't have a grinder you can put unground product into the little storage container and just chop it up with either the poker or you can even use one header or deep clean you can disassemble the one-hitter all you do is you use the included poker it's actually a screwdriver you put it in to where the slider is and then you just rotate nice and easy along it you just want to make sure you get all the rotations out and you just simply take out the little screw and then metal adjuster piece then what you do from here is you just push out on the bottom see that there's two different pieces now all four of these pieces you now soak in isopropyl alcohol to reassemble the one-hitter you want to make sure to put the ball bearing side this won't put that ball bearing side to match up with where you put your mouth so you push it through you also want to make sure this lighter opening is available for you to put the little slider piece in and after you did make sure you set it down put the screw in and then just screw it back in righty tighty lefty loosey then you're good to go put it back in the dugout you're good to go",

this one because it was on sale for a really good price um the glass is thick the hole in the bottom of this bowl is rather small so you don't have to worry about getting tobacco in your mouth when you're smoking out of this one and the mouthpiece is a decent size the only problem it's not really a problem I like it but the only flaw I would say of this one is the shape it's a weird design and it's kind of awkward to get used to but once you've had it for a minute you smoke out of it and get used to it it's not that awkward it's just different um it was another thing oh yeah and it's again

This is one. A gather of glass has been made \non the end of a metal rod. The edge is being pincered, and at a certain point, the pincered edge is pulled outward, and this begins to draw glass tubing from the reservoir at the end of the metal rod. If it\u2019s pulled quickly, the diameter is small; if it\u2019s pulled slowly, the diameter is greater. When the glass is stiff, the ends are cut. After the tube has cooled, one end is heated in a flame. As the glass softens and becomes less viscous, surface tension causes the edge to round, and eventually the hole closes. When the end has closed, air is blown in the other end and the bulge forms. In at least one example, the heating was stopped too soon, and a tiny hole was left. Here, the hole is almost closed, but not quite. Blowing begins. There\u2019s enough pressure to inflate the glass, but a tiny hole remains on the end.", "4XESDXYJ4TE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do hmm [Music] hmm do do hmm hmm foreign hmm uh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do you", "Bwv68FUOcZE": "what if I done what have I done Oh what am I done oh we said the lego movie last night so good mr. half to see it every stone when he saw it yeah that it was a movie oh my gosh we saw the Lone Ranger last night so good not have to see it yeah but were you stoned when you saw it okay the lego movie is this really solid good hey man have you seen my lighter oh no mine's blue bring that back oh no oh no no no no no no half pepperoni half cheese eight cheesy knots and garlic butter sauce yes fine thank you for calling scott's pizza we are closed today you can find our hours at our whip what if all my toys are alive like they're in Toy Story how do lava lamps work anyway the guy who invented lava lamps was a nudist there's a whole page is dedicated to nudists sports tee loominatee I don't play some real music off your father yeah I got some really good stuff on here let me find it just water take on my phone", "VvODLZ6ROpk": "your buddy it's breaking my [ __ ] [ __ ] mr.

book animals today i'm going to read the dedications and the preface on the first chapter and every sunday i'm going to read um another chapter in another chapter until we read the whole book together and afterwards i'm going to move on to the sequel to animals which is called the pack and i really hope you enjoy them so animals by j e lynch for carla with love do wolves make myths of men do they create stories in which humans are seen as examples of the ultimate embodiment of good or evil they do not to the wolf a human being is just another animal large mammals of north america by l f menslip if i wanted a one sentence definition of human beings this would do humans are the animals that believe the stories they tell about themselves each story as what we has what we might call a dark side that casts a shadow the philosopher and the wolf mark rollins the story that follows concerns the shadows of the stories we tell about ourselves and other animals preface in the beginning in the beginning i often walk at night there's no need to explain all the reasons why just now more importantly i walk in darkness darkness and and nights do not always go together in our world of electric lights and 24-hour living but when you put them together they have a special effect on the mind walk at night in near total darkness and your senses are stimulated you hear all the sounds of calling and moving animals you see glimpses of movement that you can't quite grasp your brain works furiously to make sense of it all and it is terrifying fascinating but terrifying walking alone at night in lonely places is a time machine it will take you back into the past it will take you take you ten thousand years back into the past in an instant in a single hour you will find that you are creating a mythology in your mind you will be imagining dreadful spirits ghosts ghouls werewolves other strange and hideous beasts and fearful animal-headed gods in the darkness this mythology will be your own but also it will borrow from stories and parts of stories you have read and heard whole or in part remembered with perfect clarity or buried deep in the caves caverns and other dark places of your mind of your memory it will be your personal picture of the universe visible and invisible but will also connect you to people who lived long ages ago and left the marks of their dreams and nightmares in the land you now call your own you will and this effect is heightened if it's a cold night imagine yourself building a campfire and that campfire being civilization the whole of civilization and all beyond its life being alien and well terrifying the whole of the natural and supernatural worlds are beyond that circle of light in your mind now and they have their own motivations and desires and you may be no more than a meal for some other things that populate those worlds then you think some more and wonder if there might be worse things you could end up being than a meal and then naturally you think what if what if all those figures out there in the darkness are in your mind or in the darkness of your mind that had been waiting back there in the deepest darkest corner of your mind were real and perhaps you still have quite a long way to go before you reach home part one shadows on the cave wall chapter one chiang mai is a small city in the north of thailand it's not far from the border with china around it there is a great deal of beautiful countryside there are forests of large trees of a deep green that has taken thousands of years of rain growth decay and regrowth to produce there are waterfalls and farmland and a feeling of a world that is old and new constant and always changing all at the same time like many cities chiang mai is always being built at the edges men and women with skin tanned to the color of the darkest and oldest trees in the forest work hard for long hours at building layers of concrete one on top of another when the buildings are finished they are absorbed into the city becoming like a ring in the trunk of a great tree a new layer is started with new buildings and so it goes on take a deep breath please close your eyes imagine you're an animal a dog perhaps running through the streets of the city from its outer suburbs inwards focusing on nothing and everything at the same time moving fast with a purpose you get to the center of the city through apartment buildings schools shops garages offices and in the end more and more restaurants and bars the center of the city is where you find the tourists and the things that tourists are drawn to and that the presence of tourists creates it's busy there at almost every hour of the day or night with people from many countries palestine burnt europeans move about between the restaurants and bars that line both banks of the river dirty and dark that runs through downtown australian and american accents compete for space in air that is already nearly full with the smells of food cooking in the small kitchens and on the street food stalls now bring yourself back to your human body and let go of the heightened senses of the dog it's noisy and crowded and you need to watch your back in your pocket in certain parts just like in any city now that you've seen the city notice a new arrival a girl of 13 years old or thereabouts a european child alone in chiang mai should have drawn attention but she moved with with such physical assurance that she drew none it was as if she moved faster than the city's attention could follow she was neither big nor small for her age but she moved like an athlete she seemed to know where she was going but not because she had been there before more by instinct there was an unusual quality in the way she moved it would have been very hard to explain even if you had taken the time to study her movement the fact was it was all about how she used her senses she navigated as much by sound and smell as by sight which made her look not altogether human her movement was graceful but you would not have been wrong if you compared it to the movement of a rat rats of course don't get the respect they deserve as no one moves more efficiently in a city than a rat the city stank of cigarettes everywhere even when no smoker was to be seen they had sent marked the streets there was also the smell of sewage mixed with that of of freshly squeezed orange juice and barbecued sweet corn the sweet smell of the fruits distracted the girl's attention for a moment but only a moment she traveled unerringly towards her destination down a narrowback street there was a small garage no work seemed to be going on there on this particular day from the street you could see two men inside both were large men powerful although they had big bellies they looked like what they were ex-soldiers starting to fall out of shape the falling had begun right around their middles in the back there was in the back there was a small office and then it was another man at the computer he was tall sharp fake he was a tall sharp-faced man hard and capable looking he was wearing the latest home strip manchester united football jersey there was not a single speck of oil or grease on that jersey the girl entered the garage without hesitation she moved remarkably quickly the first of the two men was dead before is aware of any threat as she had hoped that was usually the way the hard work started with the second man anyway anywhere you react in a situation of violence will leave a weakness somewhere in your posture your guard your balance your timing the girl knew this very well she moved fluidly under the straight right punch that he threw tackled him to the ground and broke his neck a little too slow the man from the office was out in the garage now and ready to fight still he was on his own and the girl was less hurried the man took a boxing stance and she noticed the blade of a sharp knife protruding from the bottom of his left fist so he would use the knife but he was not knife crazy she could not simply concentrate on attacks with the blade he would use the knife to disguise and set up punches punches to set up the use of the blade in short he knew what he was doing she moved quickly avoiding strikes and kicked one of his knees as he rebalanced she grasped his left wrist with both her hands and drove her head upwards into his jaw seconds later he was dead by his own knife the girl checked herself over for damage she was not surprised to find that she was cut on her own left arm above the wrist there was no immediate danger and the pain would not begin until the adrenaline started to leave her body she looked about her for any surveillance cameras that might be present but there were none she walked to the back of the office and opened the door to a storage room at the back when she switched on the light she could see that the room was full of cages in each small cage there was an animal maybe 30 of them wild creatures exhausted scared tired she looked into the eyes of it of shipping cats and small monkeys destined to be sold as pets the cages were dirty the smell was dreadful for the first time that day the girl hesitated then one by one and crying softly all the time she removed the animals from their cages and killed them as swiftly and gently as she was able and that is the end of chapter one um next sunday we'll read chapter two and um if you did want to read ahead you can get the book on amazon thank you very much i hope you enjoyed us and uh i hope we get to you get to keep enjoying the book um bye for now"}
