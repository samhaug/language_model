{"1D_9OGXGfig": "this is the H&Y are evil ring a variable step-down ring for your ND filters hi guys this is cinema 5d and my name is Nino if you use tiada or mirrorless cameras you will know the need for ND filters on them especially variable ND filters are something that are really commonplace to be used on those cameras because they don't have a filter built-in now the problem with these filters is that they are screw on and that means with the different diameters of your lenses you will need to use so called step down or step-up rings to actually be able to put that filter on all kinds of different lenses otherwise you will need a different filter filter for each lens and that's a problem becomes expensive which is why we usually carry around loads of these rings and more often than not you will end up having the wrong ring in your bag with your kit and that's a problem now today H&Y a company based in Hong Kong announced a really revolutionary new product it's called Revo ring and it is a variable step-up ring or actually a variable step ring which means that you can just change the diameter of that ring let me see the focus here so yeah this way you see it well so you turn it here and it just changes the diameter and that's amazing so that means you don't need a step-down ring anymore you just have all the sciences you need built into the ring itself and that's absolutely amazing it's a very very genius mechanical contraption and it's one of those things when you see the first time you immediately understand how revolutionary it is because that will make our life a lot easier in the field now of course with one of those they can't actually give you the whole range of different lenses because you know there's a lot of variety of you know diameters and lenses so they have three different versions right here I have the 46 to 62 millimeter River ring and then there's another one which is 67 282 and they also have one in between which I don't have and but even that one I mean I would mostly use the big one which is 67 to 82 millimeters and yeah the same thing here you just move it like this and you get the different diameters easily now I can show you on the lens I'll actually have a sony alpha camera here I'll just put I just put a lens on it I actually haven't tried with this one before but should be fine this is a 72 millimeter lawa lens and I'll show you how easy it is so the company agent why are actually selling the river rings in all sizes with and without filters that this is the one with the filter built in and this is an ND three two one thousand including a circular polarizer so i can show you here it's very simple you see look at my eye you see disappears so it's a very very strong nd and it can go quite a long way so this is with a built-in filter and then there's also the version without the filter where you can just put in your own filter which is nice so if you have a radial filter you can just buy this which is very very cheap I think around $35 or something on the Kickstarter campaign so that's actually for me it's a no-brainer because it just makes your life so much easier it's not actually that much more expensive than buying a bunch of those rings which makes it absolute no-brainer so now I'm going to show you how to actually put the filter onto a lens on the camera for that we have our assistant Anna here who's gonna help me thank you here's the camera and yeah here we have the filter that is a actually the Reaver ring by itself that's just the Reaver ring with my own custom filter in it I'm just trying to show that version and then you can just turn it like this and it's now to the minimum so the minimum on this size filter is 67 millimeters this has a 72 mm this diameter you just move it here and then yep I can just thank you Anna and then you turn it like that and it's done and you can just use and operate the ND filter here like you would always do so that's really really amazing thank you Anna and yeah that's just a brilliant brilliant little product that I think will be very very successful now this is a Kickstarter campaign you can order it by clicking the link below just check it out they have versions as I said in three different sizes basically if you buy all three of those diameter versions they range from 46 to 82 millimeters I think you're completely covered and I think they also have an add-on version for an ever even bigger diameter which will be like a stretch goal for the Kickstarter campaign so I think the Revo ring is absolutely brilliant and yeah I think I will use this a lot on upcoming shoots and we'll report back on a long term use of this as well and yeah and last but not least I want to say that the quality of the MD is very very good they actually use German shot glass shot is a company that makes the highest quality of glass I mean that is literally the glass that is used in you know the most expensive re and Zeiss lenses and many many other manufacturers they've always been known to make the best glass and the nice thing is that even at a very high-end D setting I found that with their and D you don't get any loss in sharpness or or anything like that so it looks quite good you just have to be you have to have to be sure that you don't overturn it because of course there is like with any very ND filters there is some kind of cross effect after some point so just make sure to stay inside the limits that are actually defined on the side of the filters and then you're safe that it all it says minimum and maximum here and if stay inside it's fine also one thing that they are actually enhancing after the feedback of a lot of beta testers like me it is quite hard to turn the ND filter without actually accidentally also turning the circular polarizer and of course you have a very nice polarizing effect they use some special kind of coatings to have a really maximum effect on the polarizer I was able to get rid of a lot of reflections while framing through car windows and shop windows over the last couple of days I'm actually not allowed to show you the footage unfortunately but it works really really well and yeah but it should be they will enhance the fact that you know like I can show you here actually yeah so you see let me just hide my face otherwise it goes to the autofocus yeah so this way you would turn the polarizer but if you just turn the outer ring you are turning only the nd so you kind of have to hold it like this so this is something they need to make a little bit more straightforward so you can operate the CPL the circular polarizer and the nd the variable nd filters separately yeah but that's it really really cool product different sizes I can really recommend it you can use just the I would just recommend to buy the biggest diameter version because most current lenses range anywhere between you know 67 and 82 millimeters only you know some smaller prime lenses actually have a smaller diameter and there's of course some wider ones which have a bigger diameter but this one actually has you covered for most sizes of lens threads and with if you just buy the ring without their filter which is actually also not that expensive for a really really good very ND filter but you can just buy the ring and just add your own circular your own variable ND filter like I did here that's an SLR magic v\u00e4ri nd on the river ring and it works quite well as well and this one actually is easy to turn because I mean this doesn't have a separate circular polarizer but with this one it works really well and that's it yeah thanks for watching and yeah if you want to buy it just click the links below thank you and please subscribe to our YouTube channel if you haven't subscribed yet

When you set up the product, the app will guide you through each step, but this video better explains possible issues such as overheating or a sleeping screen) which you may encounter if you misplace your adapter. This adapter is a metal plate that you'll need to attach to your phone in order to pair and dock to the magnetic mount. Don\u2019t worry, the adapter won\u2019t hurt your phone. Depending on your phone and case, there are certain areas we recommend attaching the metal adapter. In the ZeroTouch box, there are two metal adapters - silver pill-shaped adapter and black circular adapter. The silver pill-shaped adapter is for placement on the back of your phone or case. It\u2019s designed to make direct contact with the mount. If your phone has a curved backing, you should use this adapter. The black circular adapter is designed to be placed in between your phone and case (up to 2.5 mm thick). You can attach this adapter to your phone or inner back of your case, or simply sandwich it in between. Do note that if you have a thicker case, such as an otterbox, placing the metal adapter inside your case may not be strong enough to hold your phone up. If you ever charge your phone wirelessly, such as on the samsung s6, make sure you use the pill shaped adapter and place it horizontally at the bottom of your phone outside of the wireless charging area. Otherwise, the adapter can overheat when you place your phone on the wireless charger. For more information on wireless charging, see the description below. For other phones that are compatible with magnetic cover accessories, such as this LGG3, the magnet in the ZeroTouch mount may put the phone\u2019s screen to sleep. This will prevent you from using ZeroTouch, but don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t do any damage. If this happens, we recommend testing different mounting locations on the back of your phone to find an area where the magnetic sensor isn\u2019t affected, which is usually at the lower portion of your phone. So I hope that overview of the metal adapters was helpful. Let us know which adapter you used, and If you have any more questions or tips that worked for you, feel free to leave a comment, and we\u2019ll reply! Thanks!", "g_AndWNewT0": "hi guys this is Devon and this time I would introduce Denise I run an experienced user so I've been using this just for a couple of weeks he's been using the rails for several months so I wanted him to show you some of the basic tricks and maybe some of the more complicated ones you can achieve wait around hi guys so the first trick is one of the most basic ones it's called the figure 8 what you do is you put one ring on the index finger and another one on the ring finger you weave one ring free and then you use your thumb to spin it around then you split and spin it around with the thumb again and that is the basic part of the trick so the next trick is called the planetary orbit what you do is you separate one of the race so it's free and you spin it either on the index finger or on the ring finger and the goal is to make as many spins as possible while you keep the momentum going so one of the tricks that we're going to do next is a very basic one it's called the magnetics foot you leave two rings free and you connect one ring up to the index finger and you just use your thumb and twist split them and you can see how the magnets make them spin around and connect on the other side you can do this in almost any situation in your pocket on the street anyway well the next trick is another simple one it's called the katana you connect the Rings into a chain and you spin them around and try not to lose the shape that they have another simple trick that we do and you can do this in your pocket and it's aptly named after that is the pocket twist you can walk around the city and just do this a very satisfying magnetic spin and use this essential ease of fidget or to release stress or to think about things very very simple very satisfying another variation of the pocket twists is that you can rotate the middle ring using two fingers instead of the top ring the next trick is one of the most complicated ones it's called the axis weight and this trick is very difficult because it requires you to use momentum and use your wrist in your entire hat what you do is you disconnect two rings and you try whirl them around without having them connect as many times as you can as many as possible the difficulty of this trick is because you have to use your entire wrist in hand for the momentum you can think of your own variations and tricks essentially the possibilities are endless", "WrnEQsj6hvk": "how to connect your dermlite to any smartphone with the universal smartphone adapter here's what you need a smartphone a dermlite

look at how to use step-up rings and when to use step-up rings here's a perfect example I usually walk around with my Sigma 12 to 24 millimeter this is a really nice wide angle perspective lens for my full frame camera and this allows me to work with a filter size that's 82 millimeters so of course what did I need especially since I do a lot of outdoor photography and imaging I purchased an 82 millimeter circular polarizer from altura this one is the thin slim design which is meant for the wide-angle lenses like this so that you don't get an even yeni but then every once in a while I like to do some sports and nature photography and this guy is just way too wide so I bring along my 400 millimeter my L Series heavy lens but hey guess what this this does the job but this guy uses a 77 millimeter diameter thread size well I just didn't want to keep buying circular polarizers for all the lenses that I own so the economical answer is to get a step-up ring this one goes from a 77 millimeter diameter to an 82 millimeter diameter this means that now I can use my existing circular polarizer on my telephoto lens and it goes on just as if this was a filter it's going to thread on against you don't want to over-tighten this this is just to hold it in place we don't want to sit there and tighten this excessively because then we run the gamut of stripping the threads on both the lens and the adapter and now we're going to thread on the 82 millimeter beauty of it is since it is a wider perspective system because it is a larger thread size 82 millimeter it shouldn't cause any kind of any any when you're dealing with telephotos the only time you have to worry about that is if you're going from a wider perspective to an ultra wide perspective so you always have to check to make sure that when you look through your viewfinder or on your LCD you don't have any vignetting which is those horrible little corners that start popping up in your images of course there's a lot of us that are willing to deal with that if we can save some money and later on do some post-production cropping but now I have my CPL on my telephoto and I can go out and do some wildlife photography if

magnetic encoder ring with the LM 13 readhead a hub is being machined to the tolerances specified and the ring itself can now be pressed into place electronic compounds can be placed around the hub first before the insertion of the ring to ensure that the ring stays in place during operation so apply ring over the hub and push in place using even force across the lane the second part of the installation is to align the LM 13 Reed head the wheat head itself has an LED indicator on the back which shows red when there's no signal and green when the read head is aligned with the scale we already have here a bracket which has been put into the correct place and now all you need to do is screw the read head down to produce the right alignment and to achieve green LED and Counting due to the very large tolerances that this encoder up to 1.5 millimeters from the scale it's extremely easy to install for optimum performance we suggest that small spacer is used to bring the beat head as close as possible to the ring without contact here I'm using a piece of card to give just a small gap between the read head and the ring and now I'm going to secure the read head in place using the screws and I remove the card we can check that there's a green LED all the time as we rotate the encoder and as we can see we have a good quality signal and the encoder is set up one thing to mention is that the alignment of the reference mark is only on one side of the Ring this can be easily identified on the installation drawing and on the markings on the body of the encoder so if you can't find the reference mark as you rotate it maybe that the read head has been restored the wrong way out", "ol5X3FwRkFc": "hey guys today we're reviewing the pique magnetic ring an amazing gimmicked ring that you can do multiple tricks with okay hi guys we just ordered a three-piece magnetic ring set pique magnetic ring is the actual name and some steel pennies or magnetic pennies pennies used to be a made out of steel and due to materials and the cost of making them they reduce them to copper because that's a less expensive material so let's get right into it I'm just gonna start with the pennies because they're worth the least amount so this set came with three pennies as well as the set came with three rings which is funny I will quickly just show the pennies now they're from 1974 that's what they all say because that's how they made them before this steel penny so it's magnetic if you were to take a magnet click right on one more time it's not really important to the review and what I'm gonna be reviewing is this sort of thing right here so this is what the the three rings came in I ordered them as a set of three and let's try to pull them apart they are very strongly attracted to each other so this might be a little difficult alright oops almost had the first one okay so this is the smallest of the three now they all look like this with the black band in the middle I it's a simplistic design but I like it I'm just gonna put it on with my fingers for now no I'm not married this is my right hand let's get the next one apart just like this perfect and they come in three different sizes oops here's the biggest and here's this smallest or not the smallest the medium-sized the smallest is on my ring finger so I'll just go up the sizes I'll start with the ring finger so let me see if I can take this off there we go it feels like it's very like industrial if you know I mean by that it's seems like it's durable I'd I would hope so it doesn't seem like it's just gonna randomly break if you drop it yeah it doesn't see Michael randomly just break like I said I like the simplistic design and how it like the band in the middle is more engraved into it it's just silver and I don't know what the black is it might be like carbon I don't know it might be carbon fiber I've never really got into that and yeah that's the smallest ring now let's test it out I'll keep it on my ring finger was tested out with the magnetic pennies so off the bat I clicked on there but Oliver on my Instagram if you want to go check that out at Delusion estai just did a trick where I had the penny and I waved over just like this and just like that obviously you heard the click I have no sound audio and the other one but then you can like say oh yeah and it's gone my bad for the mic shake so that's the first test and I want to actually see how close I have to get to get them ring to go up I would say two inches at max maybe not even one and a half inches so that's not all horrible speaking so the three things I'm going to look for is price style and effectiveness I'll rate amount of fives for each category so for style I will give it a three because it's very simplistic I mean it would it would look kind of like a wedding band ring if you were to put it on your your left ring finger but it's it's alright style it's very simplistic like I said with the silver and the black in the middle for effectiveness I would give it a four maybe I mean it doesn't pick up that high really that much I'm also ordering magnetic cards I think it's only two cards but I'm ordering those and it should be coming in and at most a week and I'll do a review on those as well cuz then if I wanted to do a trick where I wave over the deck and the deck cuts itself kind of like a ghost style deck obviously not a ghost deck because those are different but you know what I mean and then for price I'm obviously gonna have the same price rating for all three but it costed me I think ten bucks Amazon Prime for three pieces three different sizes so say if you want one any ring finger bam small says biggest one middle finger medium one on my index or something not obviously all in the same hand cuz it will all click together but um it was basically 333 for the Rings which isn't bad really at all because the effectiveness like I said I gave it a 4 so I think price I'm gonna give it a 5 so with the smallest ring it's a let's do math here 5 + 4 + C that is a 12 out of 15 which isn't bad because if you reduce that so it's a 4 out of 5 basically averaged 4 out of 5 which is not bad at all so I'm gonna get on to the no no well they clicked that's a big goof moment that's the small one let's get on to the medium one now the medium ones obviously not gonna be that much different but obviously I'm not gonna put on my ring finger could it's too loose I think and I'm I wouldn't put on my index finger I mean I could but ooh excuse me but if I were to have it on my index finger I feel like when doing the trick if the penny well that that was a bad example if two penny were to click huh like that I'm pretty sure they would get a little bit sceptic not if it was like that and but I'd rather have the ring on the either ring finger or middle finger cuz I got some boundaries by that I mean let me just take this off real quick if it were to click on right here I have my pinky and middle finger to help secure middle finger is probably best because you have these two fingers but index finger it's not much because you have to cover it with this but if it goes to the left you have no cover because then it looks really weird if you have your thumb like that so let's put this on the middle finger it might be a little tight yeah um once you get it on yeah so that's a really good fit on the middle thing because it's not just gonna come off but you can obviously take it off I really like the fit of the medium ring so again I'm gonna see how high it you have to go yeah around them inch and a half but with the middle fingers all obviously my middle finger is the fattest finger of other than thumb but I wouldn't put ring on my thumb but it's almost completely covered if not exactly covered so that was that was a good test one trick I like if I show it in the middle and then turn my hand over and let it click and then open up my hand that's also we're really gonna obviously you can see it there but that's a good one wave over again it's like an inch and a half give or take a few so yeah this swings as well as good I would give it the exact same rating it's not as much stronger style wise it's obviously the same so for at five and I think the big one if I'm not mistaken is gonna be the exact same as the medium and small because the medium didn't seem to get that much better from the small one so hopefully the magnet stronger I hope it's proving me wrong see the baked one is a little big on my fingers if I were to use a big one I would probably put it on my index finger oh no that's just me I would probably put it on my index finger but for purpose of the video I'm just gonna keep it on my middle finger cuz it looks better so again here's it on my finger it's comfortable I should have talked about comfortable the Rings are comfortable it's not like it's scraping up against you they're smooth they feel good on your fingers so let's try the test again yeah that's inch and a half I would say give or take a few centimeters I wish I could magnet through the hand but I can't I mean inch and a half is not bad because from matting to work it's gonna take a lot of effort yeah this ring works as well I think my favorite one is probably the medium-sized one because I can easily put on my middle finger I know it's not gonna fly around or anything so yeah those are the three ring set I really like to set comment down below if you'd like to see this rings in action with the bicycle cards I ordered because I'd really like to do a whole session on that I know I want to review the cards but I mean like a trick session with it so thank you guys for watching stay tuned for more check me on Instagram I just posted a trick about the rings

via C track off warning lights on and it still hasn't fixed it then this next simple procedure may fix the problem so stay tuned so I'm going to show you how to perform what's called a zero point calibration unfortunately most auto scanners don't have the ability to do this so I'm going to show you a cheap and easy way to perform this without an auto scanner so let's get started the first thing you have to do is make sure the vehicle is on a level surface this is very important next disconnect both the positive and negative battery cables and wait five minutes after five minutes reconnect both cables back on to the battery now locate the OBD which is your onboard diagnostic connection port shown here which is used to plug an auto scanner into it's usually located on the driver side somewhere underneath your dash board next you'll have to find out on the OBD connection port for your vehicle which terminal connection is the cg that's Charlie Gorge and which terminal connection is the TS that's Tom Sam you should be able to find this in a repair manual for your specific vehicle next you need to get two small paper clips do not use large paper clips because they will not fit into the terminals next straighten the two paper clips like this now take one of the paper clips and slip one end into the cg terminal with the other end of the paper clip not touching anything next take the other paper clip and slip the other end into the TS terminal with the other end of the paper clip not touching anything now take the two paper clips and Bend one on the end to the right and the other on the end to the left coming up soon we'll take the free ends of the two paper clips and connect and disconnect them four times or more within eight seconds like this now make sure that your front wheels are lined up straight and make sure your steering wheel is completely centered now insert the ignition key and turn it all the way to the on position without starting the engine make sure the shift lever is in park if you have an automatic transmission if you have a manual transmission just make sure the parking brake is applied make sure as you perform these next steps that you don't shake till vibrate or move the vehicle in any way again our ignition key is all the way in the on position without starting the engine there's one two three four five six touches of the paper clips there's the ABS light flashing and there's the VSC light flashing notice how they're flashing slow and not flashing together the manner in which your lights flash may be different again this means the calibration data has now been cleared now turn the ignition key off now it's ready to be recalibrated hold the two paper clips together turn the ignition key to the on position without starting the engine and wait for the ABS and the VSC or slip like to start flashing now they're both flashing notice how they're flashing faster now and flashing together again the manner in which your lights flash may be different again this means it's now been recalibrated now turn the ignition key off and remove the two paper clips from the obd connection port now turn the ignition key back to the on position and it's been cleared now you'll need to drive the vehicle as straight as possible at 25 miles per hour or faster for 10 seconds and that's how you perform a zero point calibration also your radio presets and the auto down function of the drivers window any back window or moon roof may be lost recalibrate your windows by holding down the button a few seconds after it opens all the way and holding the button a few seconds after it closes all the way and that's all there is to it so I hope this helps somebody out there and if you like this video please hit the like

gallons worth right here and Sam's oil CVT which for the TR 580 transmission which is in this 2.5 liter naturally aspirated Forester the TR 580 transmission is one of the transmissions that AMSOIL claims that this fluid is compatible with also meets or exceeds the fluid requirements for the turbo version of CVT the high torque Orange fluid which is actually more expensive OAM fluid and the green or blue stuff so yeah pretty good stuff we'll find out after we get it in if it's going to work well of course you're going to need to jack up your car so what a nice floor jack some jack stands you want a these dealios to a creeper to get under your car easy and we're also going to use a fluid pump here got this off Amazon I'll link it and I picked up from Home Depot some some clear tubing so it's 1/2 inch outer diameter 3/8 inch inner diameter so that we can hook that up to the CVT cooler and that's where we're going to drain from so we can try and get as much of the old fluid out as possible the factory service manual recommends that you don't mix different grades or brands of CVT fluid so if we're going to put in a different spec fluid we should go ahead and remove as much of it as possible I also picked up one of these Rubbermaid measuring quart containers goes up to 8 quarts so we'll build this measure how much we're draining out of the pan we'll measure out how much we pump out later when we're doing the fluid exchange I got one of these Blackstone oil analysis kits that we're going to send off we're going to use one of these turkey basters to what we'll do is we'll take a sample after we drain out the pan we're going to take a sample from the middle of this container and send it off for analysis you're also going to want regular set of gloves and then some of these nitrile gloves when you're dealing with the fluids a couple other tools you're going to want to do this job hammer breaker bar torque wrench your hex bits and you're going to want a battery to hook up your 12 volt pump - that's pump your fluid and another alternative if you don't want to get the pump and a battery as you can use one of these lubrimatic quart pumps this is really better for a differential fluid change because there's less fluid in the differential I wouldn't recommend somebody pump five gallons with one of these that's going to take you forever so yeah let's oh yeah you're also going to want a crush washer for your drain plug so you can get this I actually got this on Amazon so I'll link I'll link that to I think it's the same crush washer that use for oil changes so it's a few bucks okay so first thing you're going to want to do once you get your going to get your car jacked up I like to jack it nice and high but do it safely and you're going to level it so you're going to put a level right along here make sure you're nice and level and then you need to remove the the under cover so I placed it in the orientation that it is under the car here so so it's just up under [Music] this way on the other it runs along right here right here you'll see it they look like this and just use a regular socket to get those off 12 milli 12 millimeter first thing you want to do is just off right here okay I got it we got a cracked open uh but I can't pull it off yet so you just got to get that cracked loose so now you know that it's crap yeah okay go ahead and his bucket [Music] alright alright this measure here looks like six and a half almost seven courts have drained out just let that keep going and while that drains we'll go set up the other stuff okay so while we're waiting for that pan to finish draining we're going to go ahead and clean up this drain plug a little off they're not when I learn difference and I wasn't I'm sorry generally not intercepted happening buildings or the running model but they want to be because and I will probably missing here with our packages or a lot for societal norms I'm looking for responsibilities around that's a wobble wobble wobble there's two sides this washer has a rounded side and more of a flat side you put the flat side up the flat side facing the pan so when it crushes down the rounded side is on the plug plug swishes that that's ready to reinstall we'll get on to the card put the plug back in oh we have the factory service manual here it shows to torque the drain plug with 23 foot-pounds so that's what we'll work it out all right we're going to take a sample of the fluid we drained and we're going to send it off to the lab I'm just going to kind of stir it around a little bit make sure we're getting egg and then I'm going to draw it right from the middle oh okay and then in it goes need a little bit more that should be good in case they need more a little bit more in there okay we got our sample we drained almost seven course out of here looks like we drained like six point six point seven maybe 6 point 7 quarts drained out of there which is right about how much we should have and we'll do the paper towel test here to just kind of measure the integrity and yeah actually it doesn't look like it was destroyed so I mean it's it's definitely still viable if it was still really black when I pulled it out then that would mean you have a problem that means you waited too long looks like you know it needed to be done I have a hundred thousand miles on this car so yeah it actually looks a little bit better than the differential fluid so we're getting the pump ready here we have those lines picked up and what we're going to do is we're going to prime it first using that hand pump that we have we just hooked it up it just happened to fit into that line nicely so open take two on the pumps test here had a little issue there is some air in the line for some reason but now that we have the pump primed I don't think it's a problem now so here's our just to demonstrate our fastest pump okay so we're going to really we're going to remove and fill plug now look don't drop it like I did okay clean Gasquet was stuck on it so don't leave your gasket unless you're replacing the fill fill plug gasket all right we're going to hook up the pump to it now it'll kind of tell you how much you're coming again as you do this so we should be able to get four quarts back in and then stop it after you know not long after that so here we go yeah this is good to kind of get crack with that because we don't want this to happen while we're oh oh we're good perfect yeah well fulfill blog anatec bug cuz that's where you'll italy so we'll let that drain a little bit more so that when we open this pill for later we don't get blasted okay so now we're going to tap into the CVT cooler and that's going to be located if you're facing facing your car this way it's going to be right in here so you can kind of let me get a light light down here so there's your CVT cooler you can see that big hose is your coolant line and then that little hose to the left here they may free up my other hand so I can show you better what's going on lighting in here sorry I'm an amateur cameraman so this this right here is your coolant line and then this is the outlet hose on your CVT cooler so you're going to want to disconnect that one there's a there's a hose clamp down there that hooks into the CVT you can pull that off and that's where we can hook into it there we go whoo first warmest our office what about Cara oh there we go got that off there so uh what we'll do is let me go get my there we're going to hook an extension on to this just like that and that comes that if that that piece comes with the pump that I ordered on Amazon probably won't have any issues but just to be safe we can go ahead and clamp that back on there so I'm gonna go that far there we go just like that now we're secured so now we have our drain line hooked up this is where the CVT is going to pump the fluid out and we'll pump it into a bucket monitor how much we're pump okay so we have our line hooked up here here's the outlet hose on the CVT cooler and it just follows this way into a drain pail here it's not going to splash it won't so we're going to just as our extension hooked on here and we're going to drain right out in it here and then we move the pump down here ground level to make it pump more efficiently because if you have the elevation changed too much that's when we've been running into problems and then under here we have our line hooked in right there to the fill the fill hole so we'll be monitoring that while pumping in we're going to monitor our fluid levels here as we drain and make sure we're pumping enough in as we drain here so we go fired up [Applause] there we go we got the black fluid come outside [Applause] Oh [Music] and set it off bit off engine [Applause] [Applause] all right good yes okay get it back off we gotta let this pitch back up [Music] [Music] [Music] alright go ahead and turn it back on [Music] they cycle see over here [Music] again rock rock [Music] okay yeah it's running out now go ahead and start up all right we're full here go ahead and shut off the engine shut it off yeah that looks a lot better now this I mean it's not perfectly clean but ya gotta wipe it out yeah so we can do a comparison here do a comparison so that's that's our what we flushed out and this is what the line looks like so that's what's coming out of the cooler the CVT right now and then this is what our fresh stuff looks like so it's not quite there but let's let's get this drained and then we'll okay we're ready for round two here we're going to start engine up shortly here you don't want to run out of ink we really think we're right no we're good we're good to watch it okay [Music] cycles and years little more [Music] [Music] all right thank you thank you helper so this is a what the return line looks like now from our CVT so this is at this is what the fluid looks like after it's ran through the whole CVT and this is what it looks like when it's going in so it's actually looking pretty damn good comparing you know this is how this you know this is what it would look like what looking like while we were draining it so I think we we removed a lot of contaminants from that transmission right now so one thing that I noticed after doing the flush is that where I disconnected the outlet this CVT fluid outlet so you can see that nipple down there I think what happened was when we when we were running that there's a there must be a little bit of pressure or something it dribbled out some CVP fluid and if you notice down there our exhaust system is right under it so you have flammable CVT fluid that's sitting right on that exhaust so that clearly needs to be cleaned off before you you know take it back out I mean or you know you'll get smoking or potentially a fire so just be aware of that when I got all the fluid back in and ran the obd reader app to check the CVT fluid temperature was still a little too high in temperature side to cool it down with the swamp fan okay where I've got this big swamp fan blowing at my car so hopefully that'll cool things down faster because I'm impatient after about an hour and a half this is what I ended up getting the temperature down to 97 degrees and that's when I added fluid back in to top it off so the temperature was slowly rising it was within the ideal temperature change so that's why I continued to pour out because the fluid was expanding so at that point I knew I was pretty much at the exact CVT fluid level that I need to be at so that's when I put the fill plug back in and torqued it down to 37 foot-pounds just use the torque wrench there till it clicked and we were done okay we have an engine on there's no check engine lights or CVT lights that's a good thing we'll go here and check check where we hooked in make sure that didn't pop off or anything no that's looking fine no no fluid catching on fire or anything it looks like I'm all wrapped up here the only thing left to do is put the cover the under cover back on that's just the people clean up my huge mess so I used a I want to say like 18 quarts probably to do this exchange so I'm definitely glad that I got five gallons of that cbt fluid you could probably not flush as much as I did but because my transmission was so dirty it needed it so I'll do one last check of the line that I disconnect down here make sure that's take it for a test drive okay we're on a road test and everything feels normal feel good like I mentioned earlier the shifting between years that's all want smooth there now let's go on T maybe at the valve body run a cleaner now yeah everything seemed to be doing great thanks again for watching", "t5TfgaAx6jc": "hi there izzy from digitalgoja.com showroom and today we're gonna take a look at how to use the altura photo 58 252 millimetres step-down ring and when do you need a step-down ring well here's a perfect example this happens to be one of my favorite mackerels this is a canon 100 millimeter 2.8 macro it's great for close-ups and I love to do a lot of jewelry photography so this guy comes in handy but here's the thing it has a 58 millimeter diameter threat I don't own a 58 millimeter diameter thread CPL but I do have a 52 millimeter diameter thread CPL but how do I get this on here this is where the step-down ring comes into play because this is gonna allow me to now be able to use my 52 millimeter on my 58 millimeter thread size so it threads on just like a filter slightly you don't want to over time this a lot of us get into the habit of what we're tightening these things and then it becomes a hassle plus you stripped the lens thread now we again thread on the CPL now what's very important is since this is a macro lens and it has one to one ratio magnification I'm not gonna have any vignetting due to the fact that this is a smaller thread size lens but you have to be very careful make sure not to use this in a situation where you're working with wide-angle lenses because if you do you're gonna get vignetting and that's that circular area around the outside of your image of course some of us can fix it in post production but the ones that want to do it initially correct you gotta keep an eye on that so you got to make a decision this way you can save some money and not have to keep buying some expensive filters over and over and over again if this video was helpful to you click the like button underneath and remember to subscribe to our channel happy shooting", "KuHbsuGnE_g": "[Music] hello my name is Tina and today i'll make an adapter to put any camera on magnetic arm i was thinking how to put the camera on machine closer to cutting tool with articulate arm was the answer I got a camera arm but got only one quarter treat on boot and it's fit pretty much everywhere but not on machine so I got an idea to use magnetic arm I used four measures with micrometer that arm got magnetic stent but another side is clamped for two type of micrometers that means that I need something between two mount the camera on that arm so let's make it first of all I draw a sketch make some measurements and write dimensions for easier work okay this is what I want to sketch really simple adapter on one side is 8 millimeter axis to clamp into arm and on other side is 1/4 camera treat in the middle is a bigger acknowledged part for a better grip then I take a piece of aluminium elided from side and turning to dimension 6 point 35 millimeter for treat about 8 millimeter long [Music] repeat that step another side I'm a here X is about ten millimeter long and eight millimeter diameter I want that diameter precise so it will slip easily into clamp but still hold solid when tighten it cut the edges and make some space for treat cutting tool and now the treat I got this engineer book but can find anything about the tree tinta so I just make some measurements and try to make it this ship treat is just rolled so it's not good for taking measurements well ok  try to measure it metric treat gauge and look like 1.25 pitch fit just okay so I can set the gear ratio on my lathe to pitch 1.25 that means that the return of the chalk cutting tool will move for 1.25 millimeter and then simply cut the treat I cut about 0 1 millimeter at once make a test and do a few passes more when the treat matches send them to nice finish then I mount ignoring tool it'd be better if I make that step when I got solid piece of aluminium because forces there are pretty big so axis and treat can be damaged for extra support I helped with Life Center when the grip is nor late I just cut the edges and the parts done [Music] and that's the part I need treat fits perfect and also shaft it's ease into arm clamp but before I put it into use I'll make one more thing anodizing with anodizing quick and paint aluminum parts and also make a thin protection on its surface so it won't scratch that fast and as the finish adapter I'm pretty happy with the result now I need to make a test it's fall to go pro without problem but in GoPro 7 I got aluminum housing can treat here need to be shorter so I make a plastic washer the treat one damage to GoPro now I can attach the arm on any steel surface and mount the camera in almost any position I really like the term you'll just set the position and block it with a single knob and it's surprising rigid I definitely go to buy Oh 11 inch version that one is 7 inch let's take a look a few examples now as you can see the clips taken with the GoPro seven back is not that good because it's too close and the GoPro isn't that good at McCrone look like I must buy a macro lens adapter for it but today I try something different yes I take off the GoPro and try attach sony a6000 to the cell turkey macro lens arm itself an adapter don't got problem with weight at all but the clips was bad anyway because of vibrations caused by the camera the day 6000 got really bad treat on the button I already got a province with the gimbal because of that so I try also it Sonja is 6510 say is 50 macro lens on much much better here I got arm attached to a spindle so it's normal that there's some vibration I also try on all eight where is less vibration but a clip is even worse that's because the Sonia is 6500 got stabilized sensor look like small vibration really must have the stabilization of sensor when I turn stabilization of the clips become awesome smooth now let's see a few more photos and clips and that's it for today like share and

in the first place well I have this lens which is 2 IX 150 micro lens with a 77 thread which I can show you right now take off the lens hood take off the lens cap and it on the list in front of the element is a 77 thread but the inner thread which is the outer ring here it's actually 67 so I needed to figure out a way to not spend another $80 on it indie or polarized filter so I decided to go with the cheaper route and this is way more efficient than anything else step down ring called fotodiox this is a 77 to 72 which and basically how these step off stepped on rings work or actually let me just make sure you guys history anodized aluminum very soon as well so I have a ND filter and also have a polarizer these are both 70-72 turrets so the polarizing ND filter this is a variable ND filter which is phone Saamy which is spelled Z or 0 M II I and this is also Tommy product so what I'm going to do here is fit the threads so the inner thread which says photo fotodiox 70 72 72 I'm sure you guys can see that basically it when I'm going to be doing oops hmm it's starting this on we threaded this on the reason why I went with this option is because it's the cheapest route instead of buying to say in the future what I could just use my indicators that I already have especially when the the iris 150 micro lens has an inner turret of 67 sold the next step you can also see that it's actually a slim profile so it doesn't but true and the benefit of this one also is that when I screw on the ND filter if it's percolated over the front element and not only that I can actually use my mint hood with this see the tail on I'm not able to use the lens hood and it's really hard to get the thread out and you can't use the lens hood on a 10:1 SP 90 ml Michael and so this will work better for me in the long term but you can see the ND filters on there the lens hood comes off very easily and does have a nice snap but you can see well now I can take video and photos without any unwanted glare on highlights or in the video footage so I suggested if you are a photographer and you have nd filters now keep in mind I suggest that if you have a smallest thread in the filter but the inner ring of the element has a size filter of 67 62 it's best that you do whatever thread that it's higher than the inner story account if that makes any sense and make sure like for instance this is this every summer thread this is a 72 indi filter inside the element is actually 67 so therefore I'm not gonna have any of that unwanted vengeance in the corner at all so pretty pretty good and I can also use the polarizer as well so that will also help in the process so this is why I invest in a step-down rings instead of buying a new ND filter which would cost me about $80 what is ami which is this friend so and I accident a semi one but they did not respond so I did end up find a step-down ring so I wanted just about a week ago takes like 10 days for free shipping to come here to the Amazon locker so yeah so I get also get to protect that front element for many unwanted scratches or damages to that front element because their front element on this particular lens it's not scratch proof at all but it does have a nice coating to eliminate some of that color fringing that ghost in and that flaring as well this lens does not have any flare so this is gonna help and I don't even need to push my ND filter that watch and the real war outside this is a six to seven stop six to eight stop in the filter so what that said everyone thank you for watching hopefully this was informal and educational and this is why I recommend by step down rings or step-up rings but I definitely recommend buying stuff that ring so if you have a bigger ND filter that you want to put it on a small ND filter that you want to put on a bigger and lens that does have stopped on which you can just make sure when you do that that that inner filter thread is smaller than the filter so it helps

guys take care have you shooted", "tsTCCHpqDXQ": "okay let me explain what I did here I made this video of how to make one of these levitation devices using ring magnets and cylinder magnets and the video ended up so long that I figured nobody would bother watching the whole way to the end so what I did was took the end clips and put them upfront and save the save the other part of the machining and assembly for another video later on so you can see I'm putting the other shaft through the center of the ring magnets now and it's a little hard to get the alignment going but once you get used to getting it in the center it doesn't go too bad oh the targets in there okay so here's the Mendocino motor rotor and I'm going to try to put that in the fixture and see how it works a little bit of a trick in it there okay so there we go and a baby here now this will jump off of the other souther fixture that I have the other stand because of balance issues is something that I have to talk about later there's there's some anomalies between the magnets and the the balance let's see how it holds up here all right I'm not sure I have optimal positioning here it's certainly not with the magnet so it's moving pretty good though and by now on the other base it probably would have jumped off so capturing the the the shaft with these ring magnets and a solar magnet seemed to do pretty well I'm sure that's caught several thousand rpms right now okay okay so that works okay here's the shaft its quarter-inch and that put a quarter inch cylinder magnets oh my gosh and as you can see the points there so right there is an anomaly about these maintenance now if they're uneven it gives you a false reading of the balance now see it seems tune little mark here you can see it it seems to stop like the shaft is out of balance really it's it's not it's probably perfect I would attribute that to being having some unevenness in the green and some meat unevenness evenness or the magnet on the shaft itself so as it rotates it it creates a little bit of a cog or a place that wants to stop that's not serious but it's there you know I can try turning the magnets maybe switching some and maybe I can get rid of that problem but we'll see but there you have it so the shaft is in there I don't have the other end plate on it I don't need probably had a little more pressure on the point that is necessary but she's swinging around in there right now you can see the shift is in the center of the ring magnets and of course this will work in any direction so now the next experimental you to try to put something on it and see what happens okay let's have a whack at this and see what we get this is a Delran rotor that explore many with earlier and put it aside for a while oh look at that I almost want some run by itself already okay so there we go all's we need is some magnets and then run away suspend it nicely close soon Center I don't know how much weaknesses support I don't think it would support the rotor from my other window motor but all I need is some quarter-inch magnets for this and we can give it a try I'll get back with you later you", "ocAXp-yJsyo": "hey guys rhino bones here with another quickie today i've got these stress relief magnetic ring fidget toy things i've got some for my class and i got some for my kids let's open it up and check it out we go it's a nifty

take your picture pose you can see yourself that's part right here is magnetic magnetic car phone mount and if so that this will just get magnetic to here is easy to come off with no residue and is easy to go right back on press it down and it's still sturdy I also like that you could put your finger in here to hold your phone and it's sturdy um it also comes with these and these is like a little hook so you would get head take this sticky part off hook it for something and then your phone would be like that I've been told by a cup of my subbies we know you love iPhone C but not everybody has an iPhone because these can be hooked to anybody's phone um it doesn't matter what foam you have so you say what about if I got a phone case how is that gonna work so I'm gonna show you this what a phone case turn it this way it that way this is my friends iPhone five you see she's got a nice case on it and I'm gonna take this one that I've used just pop it off I'm gonna put this on her case now if you notice this is one of them heavy duty cases huh foam has ridges her case and pop it up and okay and look it works okay and she still hold it and see now if you notice I've taken this off three times and look how sticky it still is okay and there you go you can use it for a tablet I don't own the tablet so I can't show you it's able and then you're taking off now I want to show you how sticky this is I don't know if you can see it up close remember I told you her foam has little bubbles you see that there's nothing here that's sticky look how sticky this thing is they

to cause any damage to the inside of the unit so once the unit is fully charged now for this one let's bring the camera in really close so remove a little protective film off the display case that's where the digital readout is gonna be you notice you're gonna have three buttons here this one's your power and fire button the small button closest to it is gonna be your plus button which is going to increase your temperature or intensity and the button next to it furthest away from the power button there's gonna be your minus which is gonna decrease your temperature now really quickly this mod is one of the only mods concealers that can do full temperature control on 510 thread prefilled cartridges so when you get a cartridge you pop it in here you're gonna be able to dial into the Fahrenheit or for all of our European customers degrees Celsius of where you want your cartridge coil temperature burner this can be very useful for certain types of oils and you can also really hone in and get a special taste on it we're gonna run through exactly how to function on the mod but there is not many batteries on the market that can bring you this kind of scalability until a lot of you guys out there you know who you are you guys want your vape to vape at a certain temperature and this mod can deliver that but it also simple watt controls so to turn the unit on we're gonna click the button five times and then we're gonna have a digital readout screen here that we're gonna zoom in on you guys see it says arrow B which is the Model D unit and then it's gonna click right in to watt mode that's what we ship our units on is it comes in watt mode and to increase watts you would just simply push little plus sign as you can see look at the watts go up this little unit will go all the way up to 20 watts that you can control in order to switch from watt mode to the temperature mode you take the power button and you click it three times consecutively within two-second intervals so you're gonna click it pretty quickly so let's go you see it clicked over and now it goes right into Celsius mode it's at a hundred degrees Celsius now you can either operate it an increase in celcius mode if that's your preferred temperature or if you want to switch it over to Fahrenheit just click the plus button and cycle up and once it goes through its maximum Celsius it will automatically switch over to Fahrenheit see how it's got the degree F next to it now and keep cycling and keep going up and down and once it hits its maximum Fahrenheit which is 600 degrees it'll automatically kick back down 200 degrees Celsius now this is a smart mod so when you turn it off once you have it on your setting it will remember the last setting that you had it on now that's pretty useful knowing that if you optimize it for a certain cartridge that you're vaping on you're not gonna have to remember that and reset it all the time so don't worry about remembering what your settings are because this will remember for you now how to get started on vaping let's just take a little sample cartridge that I have here it's empty but it's a nice gold thick cartridge looks real nice you take one of your magnet adapters they came with the kit and you're gonna make sure that the little indentations in the magnet adapter the little grooves are facing up then you're gonna screw it into the cartridge and make sure that you screw it on there so it's nice and tight don't want to over tighten it to strip the threads and make sure it's nice and tight because this is gonna make your magnetic connection then you're gonna take this and you're gonna drop it into the unit now when you drop it in it's gonna say whether it's a new coil or an old coil to have plus or minus plus if it's a new coil what you want to do is if it's a new coil to the UN so it's not the previous one you definitely want to hit the plus sign because what that's gonna do is it's gonna read the cartridge and what the ohm settings are and what the resistance is and it's gonna optimize if you click - Eska mean it was the last cartridge so it's going to use the same settings that you had on your last cartridge in terms of its electronics and its programming so in order to be safe whenever you drop a new cartridge in there and it asks you new or old cartridge hit that plus sign which is a closest one of a power key that it's gonna give you an OL murid out up there let's see what it says 1.2 ohms on the cartridge that's generally with these kind of high-performance cartridges go at it's usually between 1 & 2 the lower that the ohms are the higher performance and the faster heat of time you're gonna get in those cartridges and if you have a cartridge that starts creeping up in resistance in the ohms this is a good read out then you know either that cartridge might be close to the end of its useful life or you need to clean your cartridge so keep your eye on the ohms guys while you're vaping and then all you do is you put in whatever temperature you want based on what we went through and you push and hold the power button you'll see a little timer go up which is digital and then you push and hold inhale throughout the duration of holding holding the button down and you're off to vaping so there's also a couple other little features I wanted to go over with you guys here some people right or left-handed when they're vaping they want to see this screen read in a different way you can flip this screen over in case if you're right or left-handed or based on how you hold the unit when you vape so you can see the screen while you vape the way that you do that is you click the button four times consecutively you see how just flipped over there now that's flipped over you can vape and you can flip it back using the same thing and it flipped right back the other thing you could do is if you're carrying this thing and you're not a good person when it comes to always turning your unit off when it's not in use you can lock the unit how you do that as you push and hold the plus and the minus for two seconds consecutively and then it should say that locked yet locked right there and then push and hold for two seconds again and it should be unlocked yep see it's moving now I want you guys to see it so you could that's another cool feature so this arrow B is probably the most little sophisticated concealer unit on the market right now has plenty of big power lets you really hone it on your cartridges now in terms of size let's just show you here we got a beekeeper 2.0 beekeeper 2.0 is taller but the arrow B is wide and slim it'll fit into the grooves of your pocket the ladies out there will fit in that small little slit on the side of the purse it's a very cool transportable durable unit so I hope you definitely check it out and try it if you're looking to really dial it on your vaping really sophisticated put all the predictability back into it so for the arrow B and

"cye8LBzdOvw": "right now we'll show the are AP - 339 which is the RAM and magnetic base plate what you see in front of me here it is a rubber base which holds the magnet so you can see there's that three slots and then the other side of the magnet which is the base which is stuck down or sticking to things then you can see there there's three magnets around the edges and there's hardware to connect this to a plate so basically we put this together you need to purchase a ram beat or two or Ram tore - which has the matching plate I'm just going to look at the V size here and what you're going to end up doing is placing this plate on here so now this base is a magnetic base so to get this all stuck together and put together first need to carefully put these magnets in because you've got three magnets they're going to want to pop around a little bit so the best way to do it is to start off by putting two in and then holding them down and slam the third in bring that across and there we have it so now we just need to match up the whole pattern here there we go to the 120 degree offset holes and then you have the hardware here which just needs to go in so basically flipping this over you can see there the screw goes in each hole because they've just got a little recessed hole there so we put the three screws in and then you tighten the nuts on the back obviously I'll do that right now so there we have it we've tightened up all the screws you can see there they're all in and the nuts on the back and now we have a magnetic base so that's regulate there we go a metal plate stuff on there you can see that force those three magnets in there are amazingly strong now you've got a base you can stick that on and then you can stick a diamond plate if you already have a cradle or you can stick a Garmin GPS on this case or a cell phone or whatever you need to mount on a until its surface I guess the one thing to be really careful of with this magnetic base is just you don't stick it too close to anything with a hard drive and otherwise it will you know ruin that hard drive on that machine whatever so they have it that connects it and then everything does not go anywhere so there you have it the r AP - 339 magnetic base", "Nics1hJm8AY": "good morning everyone thank you for joining us this morning we have our ABB webinar presentation our speaker this morning maybe only Jacob Perkins he is our the global vice president of sales with ABB and I will share a short bio Oh Jacob organs is a Norwegian native with the master's degree in mechanical engineering from the Norwegian Institute of Technology and a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Colorado growing up by the sea and being around boats the marine industry and working with ship design and technologies was a perfect fit through his more than 20 years of experience in the marine industry ol Jacob has held senior positions in Europe Asia and North America working with Olsteen rolls-royce subsea global solutions and now ABB outside of work he enjoys an active lifestyle competing in Ironman so I will turn the mic over to mr. Jergens and we will get started Thank You Brenda we'll dive into it so today's presentation will have three main sections I'll give an overview of the latest developments on podded propulsion technology within ABB highlighting some of the unique features of this technology compared with more conventional mechanical options we will then look at a specific case for a modern rope ax ferry comparing traditional shaft line systems to that all that potted alternative the last feature topic is going to be around on the water radiant noise especially focusing on ferries and coastal traffic and I will tell you a little bit about what a bee-bees approach is to this challenge of minimizing on the irradiated noise and how it effects that potted thruster propulsion units that ABB is offering and hopefully we'll have time for some questions as well at the end but first let me just give you a brief introduction to the ABB portfolio of thrusters so the a support system as you can see on the screen is a gear less terrible thruster that means that the drivetrain is integrated with the motor itself in the underwater part of the thruster the power from the inboard steering module is transmitted through a slip ring unit allowing the thruster easily to rotate 365 360 degrees the steering system is either electrical or hydraulic depending on the application the system is as with the very few moving parts is designed to have minimum maintenance outside of the dry docking intervals and in some cases especially with condition monitoring installed we can push the service intervals of major components to beyond 10 years I said that range of podded propulsion from ABB is developed as satisfy different parts of the market we have robust ice units the occiput ice and as urban VI that are applicable and designed to satisfy the highest ice classes typically for ice breakers and vessels operating in heavy ice conditions the larger EXO and XL units are focusing on high and power demands and is currently the leading thruster propulsion alternative within the cruise industry but the main focus today is going to be on the medium range of thrusters typically first is used for ferries and passenger medium-sized passenger vessels so those would be the D range and the end range so with today's portfolio ABB is delivered all the propulsion systems to a vast variety of vessels anything from small luxury yachts to large offshore vessels cruise ships and ice going tankers all in all 28 years of experience with poly propulsion has given us a lot of good data which we then continuously use to improve our technology and better the performance and experience for our customers so that's the little sales pitch so now we're going to go into a little bit more detail I'll talk a bit about some of the technology developments as as mentioned earlier I'll focus today on the medium sized so that means thrusters from let's say three megawatts up to about 13 14 megawatts size and open-water units so let's focus today on applications for DP thrusters and thrusters nozzles and those kind of things so if we look at the basics of an electrical propulsion system typically consists of a power plants switchboards transformers frequency converters and propulsion motors the power plant may be AC or DC depending on the power and application and the power of course can be generated by from diesel engines gas engines or hybrid solutions with batteries or even fuel cells so the focus on this in this presentation is going to be on the propulsion system which we in terms of scope we limit to the transformers frequency converters and the propulsion motor as and you can see a little illustration of that on the single-line diagram on the right side of the screen the unique thing with the pada thruster obviously is that the motor is part of the underwater propulsion unit and I mentioned earlier that the power is transmitted through slippering unit from inboard part to the outer part so the specific model that I've drawn up here is a 11 point 6 megawatt Azipod unit for medium voltage ATAC system the transformer is used to divide the system into several parts in order to obtain different voltage levels but also for phase shifting the transformer isolates the two sides electrically a ABB uses a dry type transformer the output of a transformer supplying a pod system is adjusted to the input rectifier stage of the converter and for this specific acid but unit at 12-pulse rectifier it's used the purpose of the frequency converter is a control that speed and torque of the motor by changing changing constant frequency into variable frequency we use the voltage source inverter vs I type Drive in the case of acid bottom and it's unique in the sense that it uses controllable switches instead of there are stirs the vs is the result of the technical development of power semiconductors the power switches can be turned on and off so the output voltage can be controlled by pulse width modulation PWM the converter is therefore often referred to as V SI p WM electric motor is used for converting from electrical to mechanical power in poly propulsion we use different motors for different applications so main categories being synchronous motors permanent magnet synchronous motors and induction motors the synchronous motors are ideal for large pots because of its high efficiency in the higher power range the motor is called synchronous because the rotor runs at a synchronous speed meaning that the rotor spins at the same rate as the oscillating field which drives it the rotor in synchronous motors is applied with current by an Exeter with which the constructions which makes the constructions a bit more complicated the Exeter is applied from an excitation transformer and an excitation converter the Exeter convertor is a three-phase converter with back-to-back thyristors which can regulate the power for the subject a support em will eleven point five megawatt model we use a permanent magnet synchronous motor this motor has a magnet instead of windings in the rotor which give no losses in the rotor and fewer components the development of rare earth magnets has really taken off in that past few years and has made this type of motor available for our higher power applications but we still see the availability and cost levels of these metals as kind of constraint in terms of moving up even into the biggest thruster Pro products that we have the third type of podded motor is the induction motor which is the most common motor and then industrial application because of its robustness and simplicity construction and we use induction motors for some of the smaller pods especially in more price sensitive markets where top efficiency is not necessarily the highest priority a few words on the development of the permanent magnet motors within ABB so the key to increase the efficiency on a permanent magnet motor is to increase the power density and we've done this by studying and better understanding the magnetic composition in the rare earth metals then using full-scale tests to optimize the motor construction and also using mass computing and evolutionary algorithms to optimize the motor design so through these iterative processes we have been able to increase the torque density by more than 50 percent compared to the early generation permanent magnet motors as a cost and this then has allowed us now to introduce permanent magnet as a standard option for this mid-range a thruster size another key focus area abd is hydrodynamics and we're continuously looking at ways to perfect propeller designs by combining specific operational data for the project with reference data from our data base and and and the a support is hydro dynamically optimized using CFD tools verified by a bb's past full scale and all tests experience structural loads are defined using dynamic simulations including crash top and solos turn estimates and every propeller or a bb's ossicles is tailor designed and optimized for each vessel so that we can assure the best possible efficiency for the muscle when it comes to the ceiling and system the potted system has water lubricated face sealants primary interface and in case of primary see it break down to oral lubricated back up lip seals provide an additional two years lifetime even if your primary seal has a breakdown an air chamber between the face seal and the lip seal is periodically drained with pressure air by an automated system and can be constantly reviewed through the condition monitoring system this is done by a bisection through an injector pump from the pod bottom so this system meets the general permit compliance of EGP and there are some case especially in more in the offshore industry where where the draft exceeds 10 meters then we have to do a couple of modifications and they use spring-loaded face set of rubber below loaded term early for the slewing steel assembly 8 compare comprises of three individual grease lubricated radio ellipsis the seal grease is of environmentally friendly type thus again fulfilling the PGP compliance and the seals operate against the hardened liner ring and this is a system we have been using for 15 years and with with with you hiccups and problems maximize the output of the permanent magnet motor we have introduced additional cooling of our system so all parts obviously will have water cooling from the ocean around the thruster unit itself you can also see there on the on the sketch some of the the holes through the thruster so that we get a bigger surface area for the water to the effect in terms of cooling in addition to the water cooling we have also air cooling inside the ossified unit so the air is circulating through the pod unit and then through a water cooler ins as part of the steering module inside the thruster room and the freshwater cool base is connected then to the fresh water supply of the vessel so this hybrid cooling design has helped us improve motor efficiency by 45 percent so combined with the permanent magnet motor technology so if you worry about maneuverability I took an example here from from a study that was done together with Carnival some years ago two sister ships so what we found here was in terms of tactical diameter in in safety hard turn operations we could reduce the diameter by 38% and then similar our results we obtained from model experiments so so this was predicted and obviously it's it's a it's a demonstration of the superior superiority of the steering capability you have with the occiput system which again can can be a huge enhancement in terms of safety and avoidance of collision etc crash top is accomplished by the pod way by steering the acid but units outwards 180 degrees and thereby keeping a positive propeller rpm during the whole crashed off moment and we have similar in this case being able to demonstrate that you can shorten that a crashed off by at least 50% heading can be controlled throughout the crashed off even in heavy weather conditions which is not so easy with conventional shaft line people the currents of crabbing performance we also see here that in this study that we did together with with Delta Marine one of the leading rope axe designers in the world we could see a drastic improvement for a rope axe vessel especially when you had a tailwind so an improvement of crabbing performance of up to 57% when the wind was coming from the back you here's a couple of tracks for rope acts ferries coming in and out of the port and and again we can do these simulations now with specific vessels and specific ports with the simulation tools and the simulation center we have in ABB so actually something we have started offering to our customers not only can we do the simulations and modeling but we can also provide training and the captain's and the crew can come in and actually operate and test their vessels in the early phase of the project to see how this fits into their plans and then their experience this particular case we were able to reduce the hole in and out of Harbor by six minutes with a support offline option there is a great video on youtube if you're interested that's labeled the great a saccade race where we go through some of these examples with a couple of cruise captains and so if you have time recommend to go in there just search for the great support race go get a a nice entertaining video it's not too long kind of demonstrating so just a few more words summarize some of the technology so these open water as about units typically can handle speeds up to 25 to 28 knots as I said the maintenance should be minimal we cannot guarantee necessarily always ten years some of our seal suppliers recommend at least an inspection every five years but it dis totally depends on the operating or how you operate the vessel and and how you're monitoring the the seals and so on and if you're going into drydock anyway we recommend that you do an overhaul of the seal system be preventive in terms of any wear and tear the maximum staring rate for these units is typically six degrees per second in transit at higher speeds might be a little less and in maneuvering speeds typically nine degrees per second but it can't even go to 212 degrees per second in the extreme cases for this particular model the motor is single Wanda type and the slippering unit is single three-phase they're very compact design specifically to to accommodate ferries which often have constraints in terms of a height for for the car like above but in most cases come with monoblock Browns propellers four or five blades but we have also the option to build up propellers and even stainless steel propellers in many of the ice class vessels we would go with stainless steel propellers the acid boat can be tilted both magnitude '''l and transverse and also the the struct height so the kind of the rudder surface of the thruster can can vary in height so it's flexible within some constraints for instance the minimum tip clearance should be thirty percent of the propeller diameter that's kind of a rule of thumb but this gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of playing around with optimizing the propeller efficiency in the wakefield of the vessel so to get the right position all right I'm into the specific case study for a rope axe vessel as I said comparing a support and shaft line or the same case vessel this study was done together with Delta marine as mentioned other so the case vessel we're going to look at it's 225 meters with a service speed of 22 knots in terms of engine power the shaft line version have 35.8 megawatts installed whereas the a saccade had engine power of 33 megawatts installed and I'll come back to the reasons why there's a difference in the two but the sharp line version you had in addition to the bow thrusters also stern thrusters to thrusters of two megawatts which was not mean the Icicle version and he also had a shaft generators with so one of the first things that became apparent is that the a support option allows for a more flexible machinery arrangement and that frees up space in this case the designer was able to free up 255 square meters so machinery footprint compared to the the shaft length version a lack of fixed rough lines gives more freedom for locating the propulsion and the power plant machinery and also enabling rearranging for for higher pay a payload and clearing additional space needed for especially for alternative energy sources such as LNG tanks or battery rooms or even fuel cells it's compact design for a C pod units could fit directly under the car deck and by rearranging the engine room from the freed up space we could also gain more space for cargo and passenger cabins midship by moving comprising that that might miss you machine room more together compared with the shaft line you also drastically reduced the onboard noise and vibration of the vessel though they did a comparison and there was that there was quite a big difference in the measured noise or thing they didn't know if I should say now let's then go into comparison or or actually how we derive that the efficiencies so the first priority was to optimise the whole line as much as possible obviously if you're going to get the most benefit you want to Mai's the whole line to each alternative for the isoquant alternative the following factors then contributed to an overall benefit of 10.3% we got smoother hull lines narrower skeg the parts were located wider so no no need for a partial tunnel shape you also were able to move some of the appendices so stern thruster tunnels Schacht arrangements brackets support shaft itself and so on and obviously the rudders so all those who are contributing factors summing up to a ten point three percent advantage in terms of hull resistance the next consideration is relating the hydrodynamic efficiency of the propulsion system so for our case vessel the service fees was 22 knots which then also became the basis for optimizing the propeller design in the table you can see that the power requirement of the propeller over the speed range of and to 24 knots and at our critical service speed of 22 a study found that a support option would achieve the same speed with 13.1% Lessing's full power so from a hydrodynamic perspective the key contributors was to optimize the flow over the propeller in a clean flow the pulling propeller less resistance from from the appendages like the stern thrusters and rudders as you can see demonstrated on that on the figure on the bottom left then so to calculate then the actual savings in required install power we have to subtract now the losses in terms of mechanical and electrical losses so for the shaft line version the estimated mechanical losses were three point five percent mostly from the gearbox on the bearings on both shafts the asset but obviously had a lot less mechanical loss since there's no hardly any moving parts just just some bearings but then again of course you have losses in the electrical system and in this case this was estimated to be nine percent to adding this all up the net improvement turned out to be seven point nine percent on the required engine power with a safer alternative for then to calculate savings in fuel based on the power savings we have to match the fuel consumption data or from engine makers with actual operating point of the specific ferry route so we compared fuel spend over six different routes on our Brij the comparison showed 12.6% improvement with the electrical propulsion using lng as fuel and 11% when using MgO I'm going to numerous felonies given crime here but obviously the transparency and availability of data from from both operators and engine makers are crucial in order to make these estimates accurate and as you can see there the average savings estimated was 1.4 million annually for these routes so then in addition which was not calculated in this study but then of course you have other benefits so the the faster maneuvering so how much time you save report call and thereby having to go with top speed to catch up added car and passenger capacity onboard improved operational safety which might lower your insurance costs less need for management maintenance and lower lubrication oil costs we didn't go into that but the NASA boat system uses hardly any lubrication oil so in other studies ABB has found dependently that we could see complete or total fuel savings up to 20% now it's fair to say that the capex may especially in this higher power range be higher with Paulette propulsion than shaft line system but at the same time with those kind of opec savings the total business case will make make sense that's why we also see a growing interest in bothered and has a thruster propulsion or ferries also we see green technologies excel at being accelerated now in terms of batteries and fuel cells Helen jeans been around for a while and as I mentioned earlier that the compact design freeing up space and even reducing weight will help vessel designers so those are benefits incorporating the passive part or podded propulsion alright so the last main topic then is underwater radiated noise and how we at ABB are facing that challenge so following emission standards and ballast water and basic species issues metal and petroleum type pollutants I would say that the next hot agenda topic for regulators and industry to deal with now is is related to underwater noise our understanding of underwater noise in terms of its impact on marine life is growing all the time and I think it's it's only natural that one of the first focus areas has been on large marine mammals so for the sake of of an example here I have some reference data for orca whales which is a hot topic especially in the Pacific Northwest now regular regulate regulations are still under development but as a propulsion system provider we see a growing demand for silent notations on vessels especially in coastal traffic and cruise vessels that are operating pristine areas with lots of marine life so the main noise polluters in terms of underwater noise is from commercial shipping along with oil and gas industry especially size making high plane type activities and of course there's also military applications boys guns sonar and even submarine construction contributing now along with understanding of the impact of underwater noise we should expect regulations to develop and have a greater impact on the shipping industry DNV GL has put forward a set of underwater noise notations that's already setting standards in part of the business for a long time we've we have met these notations for research vessels for instance the most strict notation in from DME is the silent are you know on the red line on the on the graph another example is the flourish of expedition polar expedition cruise ships that has been coming into the market the last few years that typically operate in these pristine Arctic environments so they also typically have a silent notation so if we first try to paint the big picture the typically three categories of underwater noise from propulsion so first we have mechanical noise from the engines and the shaft line systems transmitted through the ship and for the whole these tend to be lower frequencies and for some older vessels the transmitted noise could come close to 200 decibels the second category of noise that we come across this cavitation of propellers sub optimized propeller designs and creates significant noise from bursting bubbles shutting off the propeller blades and there's a lot of vessels with wood sub optimized propeller designs the third category is electromagnetic noise and that's especially irrelevant for potted thrusters given that the motors inside the thruster so for podded propulsion I would say an optimized propeller is key reducing the noise of the motor whereas the mechanical noises is less of the problem I've also put in here just for illustration some of the critical frequency ranges for and noise levels for the orca whale so in terms of navigation communication and hunting so there you can see also a little bit the typical areas where this could become a conflict so they meet the challenge of underwater noise ABB has developed its own way to simulate noise from propulsion system so the red line is a typical noise print footprint that we've in this case come from a full-scale test it's actually measured measured from a vessel and then we have different models that B we have used to to kind of find a simulation that that comes close to the actual result so we use the Wiccan method for mechanical engine noise I said less relevant for for a C pod then we have the light brown line which is propeller cavitation curve and then the blue line noise from the electric motor so we're going to go into a little bit the types of simulations that we do to estimate these factor I said the island for a C pod is to simulate and predict the propeller noise using various high dynamic tools and also looking at the electric motor noise and here we will use magnetic field computations and structural impact analysis optimize the propeller dynamic performance and cavitation predictions we apply numerical computational method referred to as boundary element method or been underwater radiated noise hydrodynamic noise signature is estimated with a dynamic bubble app and tip vortex noise model for the electrical noise the also use two models firstly with finite element method for magnetic field computation and then we use structural response analysis for of the electric motor and the poly structure we can then use high frequency boundary element method for the noise summation competition so put this together to a total picture we can create a noise signature going through the following steps so we first have to define the operational conditions so the RPM the power the propeller design and the size and type of pilot unit let me go through the a support structure electrical noise motor noise response with finite element methods then we look at the asset but noise emissions characteristics with high frequency boundary element method then we measure the noise in here with specific simulated converter harmonics so can do that in our factory connecting it to our drive system and then using the reference data we can then transform the air noise to water noise using our database then we get a prediction of the Hydra ohmic noise and we can then sum up electrical and hydrodynamic noise to create the total noise footprint so item 2 and 3 needs to be done only once for each type of potted unit whereas the other a factor our our project specific so with the simulated noise footprint we also tend to do a double check of our simulation through testing in conjunction with the FTE and the factory so we can do that by measuring the vibration of the pod surface as we have found the direct correlation with simulated noise peaks at given frequencies in addition on during C trial we look at the correlation between the output from the drive and the acceleration response of the a support motor so again we found the correlation so we we can verify our simulation so the propulsion motor drive the frequency converter Drive provides the power to the proposer motor and the propulsion drive cannot provide perfectly sinusoidal of waveform but it imitates it so the closer to a perfect sinusoidal curve the the more quiet your motor will be so the only way to make less motor noise is therefore to decrease decrease sorry motor losses thus increasing motor efficiency increasing the propulsion motor efficiency we increase the motor switching frequency so which is normally three kilohertz we also can increase the motor for the realization so friends was going three-phase modulating instead of to face modulating and you can also use filters to provide more suicidal waveforms in propulsion motor feet problem with increasing the the motor efficiency in this way is that it decreases the propulsion drive efficiency so you cannot optimize the propulsion motor efficiency without any limits because if you do that we're gonna build up temperature and current level you know the propulsion drive which again can affect and the durability of the system problem with sinus filters is that they are not yet really available for the most ethical propulsion motors so and it would also have a significant cost impact if we were to install the system so there are some limitations to summarize here you see a specific example made for a research vessel with required silent our notation the key conclusion we did through this simulation is that the a support electrical noise on the underwater noise footprint is highly dependent on the the voltage supply from the drive and the natural frequency of the electric motor itself so by optimizing the drive supply and motor combination considerable noise reduction can be achieved so we played around with a switching frequency and we also played around with the motor design and material itself so in this case example we did a few iterations and we were able to optimize and improve the results by 15 decibel reduction at 250 Hertz and 30 decibel at 4,000 Hertz were critical to getting below the silent our notation so just going back to the starting point for typical passenger vessel in operating coastal waters and perhaps in that Orca habitat it is possible with with optimized for the propulsion to meet both the critical noise levels and frequencies for for the winds but also to meet that overall targets for another water noise in this case we use silent e which is typical for for passenger vessel yeah I think that covers the material I plan to have to present today so see we have think we have time for some questions I have also put my my email up there and phone number I'm sure what we might run out of time so feel free to contact me as well afterwards if you have any more detail follow-up questions that you want to have answered the Brenda back to you for now yes thank you so if you have any questions please feel free to enter them into the questions box and I actually do see one that I'll read right now so how does the capex investment of Azipod stand out compared to mechanical thrusters and conventional shaft line propulsion so the key there is to make sure or you have an apples to apples comparison so very typically we when when we see these comparisons we are not getting a fair comparison so you have to look at the whole propulsion system including the motor you have to also look at installation costs and and and when you do that I would say for a typical ferry and there's no reason why an icicle system should be have a higher capex at least when we're talking in the power range so let's say three and a half to two 1012 megawatts for the smaller units it's it's a little bit more challenging but that I think it's a severe reflection on that question great okay so I have one more this as a pod indeed need more service than the mechanical thruster so with with so few moving parts would not expect so and I would say that our experience also is which would showcase that I think as we get even more experience day that we could probably the service intervals further I think there is a perception out there about a/c pods and the fact that you know it is underwater it's hard to access and so on the a lot of operators are on the cautionary side so even with with kinesin monitoring equipment and following all the basic maintenance steps they do tend to follow our basic recommendations of of changing seals etc in every drydock and and hopefully we can we can come to a point where well that's not necessary and I would say probably were even there today so it's hard for me to say I think different operators will will give different answers to that question but if based on the design and the principles of an a support system there's no reason why the maintenance cost higher than a mechanical system okay and then I have one more in the example what is the weight difference or in that specific example I actually don't so that's something I don't have to come back to but if I talk in terms of a generally speaking for a typical ferry with twin shaft line versus two isopods it's it's not a whole lot of difference but there might be a little bit weight saving especially if you can reduce the the engine power so much that you get rid of one one gen set so we have seen cases where the the weight comes out to favor of the isopods and they're to be fair there are can also be some challenges with icy pots given that you have quite a concentrated weight in the aft chip so you might have to conduce um some considerations of that when you design your vessels but but all overall I would say it's it's fairly really yeah even on that all the weight all right and we've got one more and with regard to killer whale pods I believe you said that as a pod has less harm than mechanical systems is this assumption correct well I'm not an expert on that of the Orca the way of species and and so on I all I can say is that based on our understanding of the critical frequencies and interactions of whales we believe that there should be an advantage with a support given that the noise footprint as we can achieve the noise footprint that we can achieve so I've seen examples from vessels with that I've done noise measurements coming up much higher so obviously any reduction of noise will be positive but of course there I think there's a lot of work still to be done there and also you know maybe we have to look at different modes of operations but when you're when you're coming and coming across the whale pod should you read and reduce your speed obviously that's gonna help a lot in terms of reduce the noise and so on but so all I can say is when we look at the actual noise curve this is what we can achieve with our pod I'm sure there are the system that it can also achieve that but at least for the when you look at a typical conventional vessel out there noise tends to be a lot higher alright and then one more question what is the service interval for a regular offshore vessel for this type of pod so again it depends a lot on the type of operation and how heavy-duty the units are operated we have had potted units on on oil rigs where we have happily guaranteed and promoted 10 years services and in some cases we've even seen that the products been more or less untouched for 15 years but 10 years we typically say is is reasonable for a BP offshore thruster all right for fairies what operating speed would you start looking at nozzles and what type of nozzles do you use so so obviously a nozzle crazed drag so typically we it depends a little bit on the vessel on the speed but we typically say that you can consider nozzles up to 14 15 knots and beyond that you not gonna get you're gonna get a lot of additional resistance and drag and therefore therefore you out weighing some of the benefits the other thing of course to note that when we use nozzles we were not using pulling propellers other than the propeller will be pushing the vessel so there will be a little bit different characteristics there as well and we can we can supply different types of nozzles I don't have really a standard answer to that type of nozzle alright so we've got a couple more minutes for any more questions if anyone has any more okay you have any questions later then feel free to contact me and I can also be in touch with my colleagues there are experts in the various fields so happy to entertain that later on great and then we will also add a copy of this presentation on to our steamy webinar library which you can find on Sami org and thank you for joining us thank you very much you", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works perfect for you for lots of cool products that you've seen here today you can check out our website

fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "qnJnuDTWlms": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you

the environment a lot of people demonstrating and talking about the environment we're very fortunate on alternative views today to have John Milton with us if you haven't heard of John Milton well you should have because he is one of the originals talking about the environment and doing something about the environment all around the world he's one of the founders of Friends of the Earth he's written eight or nine books about the the environment as an ecologist he actually wrote the first basic book on the environment called the future environments in North America and another one of his many books was called the careless technology the results of what happens when the World Bank and some of those people go in and have these different operations and different constructions which particularly in the third world John also has set up ecological activist coalition's around the world he set up national parks all over the world and well gosh if I continued on talking about what he's done it cuts into the time we have to talk with him so John we're really pleased we're going to be here a pleasure and that you flew in all the way from Colorado to be with us what we want to do is to have a general overall survey of all the ecological problems that face us and then talk about what is being done what we can do and whether it's too late or not and also who is responsible for the environmental problems which we have right now well you're specialists in the rain forest particular you've been all over the Amazon and in many parts of the world but is the rain forest destruction really as bad as what they say if anything I think it's a little worse than what you generally hear in the media and one of the things that astounds me is that we're now calculating that within the next 10 years most of the rain forests left in Southeast Asia which had one of the most diverse rain for us anywhere in the world it contains somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of the all the species that are found in the tropics that that forest will be virtually eliminated within the next ten years and what is causing that is that an aftermath of Vietnam and the Indochina Wars our economic development part of that is involved in the sense that the the whole movement of industrialization in that part of the world began to happen at that time but there's there's so many players now from so many different countries that are beginning to move into the into the Southeast Asian picture that you want the major players for example that's become Japan and just as you both I'm sure quite aware of the role of the Japanese in causing the everything from the killing of tuna but we're fishing in Alaskan waters tremendous devastation in terms of the ocean environment in the same way they've been a major factor in the destruction of the tropical forests of Indonesia and Malaysia and very recently began to move into Burma now Burma is a country that because it's been so closed off from the outside world and because there's been a war going on between those tribes in the north and the government down in Rangoon Rangoon in the South Burma has effectively remain closed to development interests from the outside the Japanese just recently negotiated a contract to go in there and do massive deforestation of the teak forests and the rainforests of Burma for the first time and that was the last place we had in Southeast Asia that we've helped at least in Burma those great forests would be protected and if there was a chance for the the reforestation of many of the other countries at least Burma would be a pool at which the reforestation could occur now even that is up in the air because of this Japanese initiative now they say that they and the multinational corporations in the various countries say that they want the raw materials or they industrialized countries North to use so this is why they're doing it and they say that it's worth the price what is the price of these raw materials no destroying the rainforest well that's the whole problem with the economic system with that we've got there is basically all of the environmental costs are not factored in virtually all of them are not factored in when it comes to the way that the cost-benefit ratios are calculated in classical economic theory when you do a cost-benefit ratio in general the air of the water the genetic value of the genetic pool of resources that that's involved all of these kinds of things are have no value whatsoever they're not factored in it in any way another problem for the way in which we've we work our economics with the living web that is that by and large the cost-benefit ratio tends to favor particularly if you have a high discount rate it tends to favor very rapid consumption and utilization resources in the near-term future to make a profit as quickly as possible this allows you to pay off the discount rate to pay off the interest quickly to the banks yes and if that is a higher rate than of course you want to do it even faster this means that you basically in a cost-benefit ratio which balances the costs and the benefits in most cases because the your you're running to make that profit and to pay back the banks or whatever the loan institution may be most of the costs most of the impacts are very very long-term costs and yet you may get the loss of an entire ecosystem or devastating floods in the in the Ganges could wipe out the homes and the livelihood for millions of people but in the near term you might get two or three years of productive agriculture up in the hills before everything starts to wash away what terms the cost-benefit ratio it makes sense to go ahead and plant those two or three years of crops make that profit and forget about what happens 20 years down the road it doesn't matter because that's so far down the road in terms of the cost-benefit ratio that it comes out in the ratio is a very tiny little figure it's not amazing and that's the way our decision making is made in terms of the environment we frequently read about in here about Brazil and what is happening there terrible destruction not only the rainforest but of people in their culture the vicious massacres of the Indians native populations in addition to this I've read some really scary things that because this is the play the enormous rainforests produced the oxygen which we eventually which we breathe as being recirculated around the world it mean is there really possible that the world could run out of oxygen because of the depletion of these rainforests it could certainly enter into a major of a major contribution in the depletion of the oxygen on the planet the oceans also play a major role in this but also in a rain and in the in every way rain in every way this could cause perhaps gravitas droughts around the world in a good example of this and people don't generally realize this but the the tropical zones are acting like a huge weather generator if you go into the into the Amazon basin it's amazing because those rains start out in the Atlantic Ocean and they start rolling across the Amazon basin a great rolling wave of weather and as it moves across the Amazon basin and you have the rainfall which then of course nurtures the rainforest the rain comes down and then approximately 75 to 80 percent of that rainfall is immediately that put transpired back into the atmosphere only something like 20% of it goes back into the river systems and then much of that actually gets pulled out by the roots again and also we circulated so perhaps only something like 10% of that that moisture actually goes back out to the Atlantic sly of the Amazon all the rest of it moves in a tremendous rolling wave of moisture and humidity that goes all the way across amazon waters it and then moves to the north in the south to water Venezuela and down to in the case of to the north - water Venezuelan to the south - water the Argentine the Chilean territory as it moves to the south it waters in particular some of the very fertile lands that we have down in in northern Argentina in particular it is virtually the major weather generator for the entire breadbasket of that part of South America which is probably the most productive area in South America with it was interesting when a series of multinational agricultural corporations moved into southern Brazil and Argentina Chile they saw that there was very very rich land in that part of the part of the world they decided they wanted it so they developed a scheme in collusion for the Brazilian government to basically buy out the settlers the people that had farmed that land the small farmers that had done a real good job for hundreds of years and that really rich agricultural land they worked at a deal with the Brazilian government to build roads with World Bank and a ID money from our country and then provided very attractive sending 160 plus hectare pieces of land in the Amazon rainforest not telling anybody that that sells only cultivatable for a few years and then it becomes infertile God solely infertile forever or can it be retrieve infertile forever under conventional agriculture thanks Tom and not only that it often becomes hard laterite and becomes a desert but that's another story the point is that the basically had a forced exodus of millions of people from this the zone to the south which then settled the Amazon becomes the Amazon deforested vast areas the multinationals ended up with a good agricultural soil in the South that was not subject to the heavy leaching and loss of agricultural nutrients and soil nutrients that you find in in the tropics and the people that used to live on that land it ended up with soil which then produced for one to three years dig quite well and then suddenly they began to find that the protein yields my dad then they found that their overall yield just the amount of biomass amount of agricultural material that they can grow period began to drop and then suddenly they found they can hardly grow a thing because the leaching of when you have an agricultural system with its put into a rainforest the original system there is a very complex multi-tiered rainforest that basically has many strata to the forest and so you have high trees deep root systems broad root systems and layers underneath that with different networks of roots stand into the soil and enter an herbaceous layer with again a whole nother network of roots when the leaves fall because of the high temperatures they break down very fast and break down into soluble nutrients high rainfall high temperature those nutrients very quickly get leached out of the soil and immediately picked up by those root systems and recirculated back up into the living system so most of the fertility of the rainforest is literally in the living organic system it's amazing when you cut that forest of course what the first thing that happens is you go and you plant your crops but it doesn't the the network of roots only covers a very shallow area on the surface plus there many areas where there's no crop at all lots of spaces in between so after a couple of years of rainfall under those high temperatures and high rainfall the nutrients start getting leached deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper meanwhile what's left of the old roots of the old rain forest system begin to go and die off soon there's nothing left to capture those nutrients and they're lost forever eventually they go down into the earth then if you continue with your insanity your agricultural insanity what often happens is that that soil becomes a rock-hard laterite which means that it binds and becomes literally as hard as rock you have to take a pickaxe to it to break it up so you can't then refine a chef in any way then it's very difficult for roots to to get anything down into it it becomes baked and this is already happening as a result of the destruction exactly over what diamond expanse oh is it massive yes last year I remember the reports we had from the rainforests or something like they were reporting between fifty and a hundred thousand fires burning major fires printing just in the Amazon alone as as the Amazon was being cleared and the paradox and then the tragedy of this is that those people who were the victims the people that are being brought into that territory the whole motivation was to provoke to give the land away cheap to these multinational corporations that voted out for the south where you don't have those high temperatures and you don't have that heavy leaching because of the high rainfall and high high temperatures John Young would like our own Midwest you'd mentioned the devastating effect this would have on all of Latin America if the rainforest dries up because the weather from that goes as you said throughout the continent what effect does it have in a more global dimension in terms of global warming trends or then weather patterns that go to the United States Europe and the entire world is it a big impact on that as well yeah definitely because basically in the same way that we were talking about that rolling mass of moisture that moves across the Amazon two things other things happen when you can destroy the rainforest you destroy the entire winter weather generator for the countries to the north and the countries to the south which means you basically eliminate the rainfall base for Argentina Chile Venezuela Ecuador and so on it doesn't just affect the Amazon basin it affects that entire area in addition just like an air conditioning unit when you remove all the vegetation all the transpiration and evaporation that's occurring and you leave behind a kind of hot desertic kind of environment you completely change the rate at which the upwelling occurs of hot air along the equatorial belt and the related sub-material belts because they're being deforested too that means that the whole weather generation system which basically depends upon a particular rates of you of the lifting of hot air up into thee from the equator its descent again further north all of that has a very powerful effect on wind patterns on rainfall distribution and so on all that gets totally disrupted all of our crops are entirely in all over the world are entirely dependent upon a stable weather distribution pattern if you change that suddenly the trees can't live because they're not getting enough rainfall or it starts getting too hot which you cold you basically introduce massive destabilization into global environments and totally unpredictable ways it's much more serious than just the loss of oxygen which is serious but the main saying that I feel is the issue is the total destabilization of world clinic and when you think that just to loss in our Midwest let's say if we have an average reduction of five inches of rainfall a year that's it you've got a southwestern desert back to the Dust Bowl yeah and we're at the same time we're running out the we've already mined all the water out of the Oklahoma aquifer in the in the high plains so there's no fossil water to fall back on because we've already wasted that and we're poisoning what little is left with fertilizers and artificial fertilizers so we're left with a situation where I can see that directly impacting our American breadbasket and already it's happening it's already happening well you see these documentaries are news stories about how the water is disappearing from out west because the big farms are using it up this is just another one of the ecological disasters and the aquifer poisoning at the same time even if we had didn't have the problem with the e with rainforest destruction what effect would that have on the United States of the aquifer poisoning and the water depletion from overuse well basically this country under the wise and careful custodianship of the Native American peoples maintained a tremendously rich series of organic systems ecosystems and resources which amazed me when you look at the other parts of the world like China most of Asia relate for that matter answered made the universe tremendously rich organic diversity had been maintained here under the under the custodianship Native Americans how did that work what did they do to preserve these systems well you know there's one value produced I mean there's one value there that is interesting and we were talking earlier about the cost-benefit ratio and how basically the cost-benefit ratio says if he doesn't pay back within two five years it's no good doesn't matter what the cost is further down the road that's just a tiny little thing the only thing we care about is what we get back in two to five years and that's the fundamental value of this culture that we've got that's the basic problem right there and what did the Native Americans do differently well the Native Americans said we will not make any changes unless we look ahead seven generations minimum Wow and we can see that it will be good for that seventh generation if it would be good for that seventh generation and for all the other living beings of the earth that are who our brothers and our sisters and our mothers and our fathers and our grandfathers and our grandmothers and our cousins then I change is good and beneficial I will go ahead that was their basic economics and what did they do to preserve the systems in terms of their technologies that is just that they didn't pollute them they didn't they were cautious as to what waste went in them where did they actually cultivate the aquifers digging irrigation ditches or whatever there was some but the basic Native American ethic said that you will respect the the skin of mother earth mother earth is a living organism and to go deep into mother earth and to and to take out her lifeblood through by trying to mine the water or mind the deep minerals is is like doing surgery on your mother when she doesn't need it when she's perfectly healthy would you go and take your mother and and cut her open and start taking her organs out uh-huh so that's what's basically there you and now we might look at that and say well this is ridiculous but I mean take a look at what we've done we've mined out the Ogallala Aquifer it's it's just about dead there's no where is that here well basically runs from near the Canadian border and it runs along the whole Plains short grass prairie on into the tall grass prairie country from up in the Montana country then through Kansas run into into Texas and it's the major aquifer for the western plains district of the Rocky Mountain region or just going up to the Rockies and it was the main water resource that we had other than the free-flowing River systems themselves what we have done has come up with in through our technology and incredibly wasteful system of mining that water and then spreading that water out on the land no concept of even the most fundamental things like a drip irrigation system which very carefully meters are just a little bit of water at a time the minimum you need to keep the agriculture working instead of just massive utilization of the water no cost placed upon the fact that it's a fossil water that's not going to last forever so basically what we have done is to take the gift of Mother Earth there we've mined out the fundamental organ system you might say the Monroes you mean stuff like iron and coal and same thing the same thing isn't water we've taken the the copper and we've taken the the iron we've taken all the minerals and just ripped it out of the earth what happens if there's a breakdown in culture following a major global catastrophe if there is a either some sort of catastrophic war or some major breakdown within the overall structure we do not have concentrated sources of minerals anymore it takes a lot of energy to extract those minerals concentrate them bring them back together again but the only source over some dumps and it's an interesting there I think with Harrison Brown that came up with the thesis that the decline of civilization may be due to the fact that we've already wasted all of the concentrated mineral resources of the planet if there's ever a major perturbation and breakdown of the Organa of the basic culture of the planet human culture will never be able to come in constantly concentrate all those mineral resources to achieve any level of technology in automotive technology it's an interesting idea well there's another thing that this happened and that is soil depletion not only through erosion but through chemical fertilizers not to mention cut and burn tactics in third-world what's the status of our soil of course it gets blown away during dust storms - what we talk about the water without soil you know well I should also say just finishing on the water the fell excuse me in the case of our Iguala we basically it's almost gone we just have a few years left now people are frantically trying to grab water from from the Rocky Mountains la is just sucking the Colorado dry the Texas and Colorado are both trying to go into the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado and steal the water away from all of the farmers of that region that have lived there for for hundreds of years and take that water and pipe it into Texas in Colorado in order to bail them out for a few more years and there's some interest groups that are ten make several billion dollars of that project but it will devastate the farming community southern Colorado which is already a poor it's been a community right you know for the most part in a poor angle it'll poorest panic community wonderful people but there's not lots of money and the only thing I depend upon is their agriculture that's what they live on you take that water you destroy their livelihood totally and we're talking now about destroying the few self-aligned I was angry cultural systems we have left siphoning off water for the cities and for the very wasteful agribusiness farming operations which is a tremendous amount of water much more than it's necessary at least the small farmers by and large tend to be much more conservative about the use the corner and the same thing the soil now the loss of the water resource is happening everywhere it's most apparent in the southwest because there the water resources are very scarce and critical and so we're coming up to that fine edge much earlier but it's of course happening a major issue in California and becoming a major issue even in the well water a relatively low water East Coast simply because we've polluted so much and we've wasted so much even in a incredibly well water period in fact let's talk about pollution for a minute before getting into the soil in 1962 I think it was rachel carson's wrote her book Silent Spring that was one of the first dramatic documentation of the poisoning of our rivers our lakes and the sea through chemical and other industrial pollutants what has the situation been with pollutant since then we didn't learn a lesson early on in the early sixties you also were writing about this topic at that time and despite the scientific knowledge and awareness that tremendous amount the pesticides and chemical and industrial pollutants were destroying what was left of our water these ways continue did they not absolutely and what is the magnitude of this today now 30 years or so after I was just thinking while you were talking about part of the year I lived down in Baja California conducting wilderness solos which I believe to be a very powerful form of environmental education and sort of an opening up to a new kind of philosophy that sees the the earth as an organic living being we're directly without any interpretation just a direct experience of that but at the end of my work period down there this year I had those in this paradoxical situation I was working for a group called the Conservation Foundation back in the 60s and we gave Rachel Carson the first grants to write that block I say spring and supported her work in the back in the year in those days and I suddenly found myself being subjected with ten broad-spectrum applications of malathion in the little agricultural waste as I lived there in toto Santos this was about four weeks ago my partner's down there wonderful when women from Texas another wonderful woman from from that area myself had to evacuate and was that when they were spraying for the flying for the mid flight see the net flies to mallet flies bad stuff it's very benefi it's teratogenic which means it causes genetic mutations it's how it causes many different forms of cancer and it destroys the entire organic base of the natural self-regulating control system for pests the problems were too damn greedy in most Native American cultures another ethic was you give something to nature everything in nature needs to be taken care of all beings have equal value including the insects so you offer a part of your crop goes to to all these different beings it's just the way of nature you don't try to take it all you know it's like sitting in a family table and mom and dad take you know the whole meal we don't treat our families that way why should we treat nature that way it doesn't make sense particularly in an organic system it's totally interconnected so basically that's what we're trying to do with our contemporary agricultural systems our whole approach to the earth and it's into the resources I mean they're not really resources they're basically our family and down there that same sort of greed took over we banned a lot of that stuff here in the States like DDT a lotta that's getting exported into the Latin American countries and into Asia and I mean you're getting places that are having 50 to 60 and up to a hundred applications of pesticide in a year and coming back to us and food that we import things right we imported all this stuff too but on the malathion issue the the paradox is that we already have the techniques and the approaches we know that if you sterile second sex attractants you can kind of trap the fruit flies in two traps which then move the the fruit fly you can simply do nothing and the natural wasp population will build up and wipe out the mint flower bring it down to a low level you don't have to do a thing nature will do it or if you want to speed it up a little bit you can use some of these newer techniques like the release of sterile nails when you swamp the population with the sterile male fruit fly and basically that brings the population down very radically of the fruit fly and I guess that was done here in Texas for the screwworm fly very successfully doesn't affect any other species redeye screwworm fly in the sea in the case of the sterile males but in any case the point being that we have many very biological control all terms we are not using these things and and we're certainly not trusting the basic inherent natural controls of nature yourself and what is the extent of pollution Sensei Rachel Carson's book in the 60s is the percentage extent growing dramatically or is it pretty much the same or how would you rate it globally in let's say in the u.s. in summer is it's dropped and in other is it's increased we have been able to eliminate some basic pollutants of air water like lead using some of the PCBs dropped however some of the nitrogen based pollutants have increased I'd say that we probably have a greater problem of fertilizer contamination of the soil and organic contamination of the groundwater systems we had and 10 years ago 20 years ago by far on a global basis I'd say were much worse off many of the toxic chemicals that we produce here in the United States as we've developed more environmental consciousness here we have exported these chemicals through Dow and the other two chemical companies we've exported these these things into other parts of the world and they still want to make their profits and they do so they sell them to countries that don't really know what the hell's going on or don't care they have governments that do not care so ironic also you know this also relates to smog and the stuff we breathe and two things which we eat which have all these chemical additives and are as a result of the fertilizers chemical fertilizers then you add on top of this the fact that the tobacco industry gets export subsidies to sell cigarettes overseas and they're forcing cigarettes on a lot of countries that don't want them so that the the internal ecology is being fouled as well as the external environment of the of the world what about the soil now we've talked about the water being bad chemical fertilizers being bad we've heard for years about erosion and planting certain crops which destroy the richness of the soil what's the status of it a few years back I guess it was around 78 78 79 80 oh I took a a job I was was working as a professor of ecology and regional environment so the University of Colorado College and central versus our University of Illinois facility in central Illinois and took a very deep look at what was happening to the soil of our our American Midwest which is really our basic breadbasket these are the soils we really depend put in Illinois in Iowa and places like that what astounded me was that we were given a birthright in terms of our tendency of this continent this Turtle Island the Native Americans call it and Turtle Island Islands the name North America because on one hand it kind of looks like a journal if you look at the continent as a whole but also because the Native Americans saw saw this incredible continent is riding on the back of a great cosmic turtle whereas traveling through through the universe and it was an interesting the way it's their view of data I think a very clear view of things like continental drift a long time ago they had different analogies for all but very perceptive in any case when I went to Illinois I was amazed that area which used to have 36 inches prime topsoil jewel is what that is 36 inches of topsoil when you talk about wealth Gold is nothing compared to that we took that 36 inches and in less than 100 years we brought it down to 10 to 18 inches we wasted between 1/2 and 2/3 and how does that happen how do you deplete or waste the soil in that way what you do is you introduce a lot of mechanized agriculture util a great deal you till in such a way that you leave the soil exposed we used to have a mixed agricultural system in this country small farming and agriculture so they tended to be a broad scale utilization of many different kinds of crops and you had animals also as part of the agricultural system as well as the crops with that you tended to have recycling of organic manures which helped soil structure and also protected it crop rotation give the crop rotation you had many techniques in the old days which made a lot of sense many of those techniques were picked up from the Native Americans the Native Americans were doing a lot of really good thing we should have learned a lot more things in the Native Americans when we first came here we had closed minds linear we were not looking at the totality we were not taking a holistic view we just looked at ok we want this and we're going to get it this way real greedy productive outputs and ratio is just trying to produce more in a shorter time also a technological hubris thinking that big technology is going to produce more and better just like big assembly lines in factories produce more cars or more steel likewise big farm mechanized farm equipment is going to produce more goods or more food but it's going to actually destroy and deplete the soil and the nutrients through then what happened with in the case of the Midwestern soil is that was definitely part of the picture but and on top of that we phased out the mixed agricultural system when you had mixed agriculture it meant to basically had to work there year-round which means you could fine-tune the agricultural cycle to the time of the year knows you could plow just before you plant it or shortly before planet with the arising of eliminating animals as part of your crop ecosystem then a windfall cane well to save some time in the spring since you had your your tractor out there anyway you went ahead and ploughed and you had a cover crop and you plaid that under and then you just let the soil I bear until it's time for spring planting that meant that the soil laid out there under the winter rains and all the wind erosion for say three to four months out of the year that one simple change led to most of the solar erosion yeah loss of our heritage and why was that it was because people wanted to take a vacation and go to Florida well what about agribusiness so they're there they're a year-round operation right they to tend since they can't grow in many of these areas in the winter because it's more efficient from a pure business standpoint to get that edge as close as possible if you do your plowing and fall after you've got the last possible crop in and then you do your you do your plowing and then you get that crop in as quickly as possible in the spring as soon as you can get it in there if you and you can do that if you've already planted it back in the fall same thing agribusiness is right in there with everybody else what about use of chemical fertilizers what that do to the soil when you introduce chemical agriculture the basic problem is that the particularly a lot of the nitrogen based chemical fertilizers tend to create the very blocky hard soil structure it becomes difficult for the soil to hold water and to maintain a structure that is relative fairly friable and easy for plant root systems to work with and over time it actually can make it increasingly difficult to plow even it's not unlike what we were talking about with the tropical laterites in some ways the other thing that happens is that you over time begin to make it more and more difficult for other kinds of nutrients to be up taken by the root systems they can tend to get trapped in the soil itself there are many many different things that happen we need to introduce chemical fertilizers a major impact is that many of the much of the excess of the nitrogen and phosphorus that we apply to cells washes off goes into the streams and becomes a major source of chemical pollution which basically wipes out the the flora and fauna of the streams and is another major source of organic pollution of our rivers people don't again don't recognize this either but the thing I was going to say about the breadbasket is that this breadbasket we're down from let's say thirty six inches to perhaps an average of ten inches in a hundred years hey soil yeah I mean that's let's say two-thirds I'll say well at current rates we're talking about wiping up the agricultural foundation of our economy within I'd say 20 between 25 and 50 years depending on how we manage it may be basically a desert than our breadbasket will be and I'm talking about just through erosion and think about it I just did I go ahead I'll be dead by then you don't hear this being talked about in the media very much I mean your show is one of the few I've ever been asked to even mention the subject we're into trendy things I mean I birthed a is an important initiative don't get me wrong but and it's very important to do things like recycling but we are ignoring the fundamental core ecosystem issues what is it particularly that's polluting the air what's causing a zone pollution and smog and air pollution and global warming trends obviously the air is part of this ecosystem that's under assault just like the slough in the water gosh everything totally if you think about it we live in such a highly technological and industrial system that we're becoming increasingly depend upon our no synthetic cheers just look what we're wearing yeah I try to wear natural Cotton's as much as possible and I'm wearing shoes made of cork but I still have a little rubber that's partly synthetic cotton socks if we just analyze ourselves and start looking at what we're using what we walk around with this is organic in a sense this is natural this Peter caisson it's quite astounding and we write from our clothing line on out into our environment we're increasingly living within a cultural ecosystem that sucks resources out of the natural ecosystem can calls it natural resources converts it into stuff that we place value upon and in the process of all the transformations that occur particularly when we shift into things like synthetic plastics and many of them highly they're all the different or official kinds of chemicals that we've created it's astounding there's so many pollutants in the atmosphere at this point that I don't think we even have a book the tiniest clue of what each one of those chemicals is doing when you when you take a look at the windblown fertilizers the pesticides all the traces poisons in the atmosphere from all the different kinds of chemical plants and different kinds of processing plants and you take a look at the then you look at the gross ozone release from the automobiles and the nitrogen and sulfur gas and releases might have lived in the area in southern Arizona that was being impacted with some of the heaviest so2 pollution in in the world from the copper smelter it's built by Phelps dodge down there so2 being it's a sulfuric acid okay and for about seven years my friends who were asthmatic so know what several of them died babies were being born with in horrible condition and people were walking around coughing wheezing phlegm coming out of the lungs every day of their life it took myself and two others decided enough and we had a series of strategy session sessions in the early we constructed a campaign to basically turn this around close that smelter den or list the three smelters involved and we then kicked off a campaign that drew tremendous local support groups we had a group called gasp and then it caught on a little more get more attention from a few national organizations that joined in and helped and eventually we actually closed the smelter I think it was two years ago we closed the smelter down but we had to have many very direct actions in front of that smelter which is right on the Mexican border route 666 dead ends and that's milker which the Christians will appreciate that that's we basically had a series of what we call die ends because at that time the EPA was except that it was acceptable to have cept or a risk to have 128 129 deaths in the immediate area of that year or to know it was okay we shouldn't really put too much pressure on filming on so we had a Dian where we went down and we had hundred and twenty-eight people die in front of the smelter and just to publicize that attitude that value not to mention the fact that that smelter was the source of virtually all of the earth the major source of s rain for the entire Rocky Mountain region that meant that the Rocky Mountain region only had a few years to go before the lakes and the forests began to die in the same way that the forests and the lakes of the Appalachians have already died okay that's what I know so that was a unique opportunity for us to actually go in and take an action and to do to take an action in a peaceful way but basically a direct action which would hopefully get some results and it actually did manage to turn things around there's a lot that people can do if they're willing to be good ecological warriors with compassion once they're fighting the same thing now with nuclear plants that not even to mention the nuclear weapons that have been set off a nuclear bomb testing that is has occurred in the air in the past and they on the ground still but now they're finding that the death rates and other health problems have skyrocketed in just within the areas of nuclear plants similar to what you're talking about but you can't see it and it's difficult to measure so they don't do anything about that well the nuclear level is such a it's such that represents such a level of insanity I can I heart I find it almost impossible to conceive of that level full of demonic force being consciously brought into the planet and that means nuclear energy as well as nuclear weapons yes both of them have the same he struggles with nuclear energy is a total - fraud fraud right because basically every xi is no friend of mine did one of the best analyses of this process of anybody that I know he runs the Institute in the Rocky Mountains now for resource analysis and excellent group in any case Emery pointed out a number of years ago after doing some very careful research that the fundamental reason for building the nuclear nuclear power plants for peacetime use was to actually breathe plutonium they can then be used for right missiles and this was the main purpose and that all of the talk about low cost electrical usage was farce now the other thing that we did nobody has taken into account with these nuclear plants I mean they don't work they work for a few years and then something generally will go wrong closes it down they're very inefficient they're costly to build in the very inefficient the cost of decommissioning a nuclear power plant has rarely been taken into account and the commissioning costs we know estimate on the average will run at least two to three times more than the cost of building plant cash they say nobody has thought about those costs in terms of what we're adding on to our future generations you know what they will have to pay it's making profit today and then leaving that consequences for tomorrow saying the federal deficits another example of this mentality yes and if if this is the case I mean no well it's it's it's it's awesome because we're talking about heading ending on the cost here that is going to be incredibly massive before for the future on top of all of the other burdens that are that we're passing along and then we have on top of that things like Chernobyl which which happen and those kinds of things are going to happen increasingly if we shift towards nuclear I read recently that the cost of cleaning up Chernobyl will be in excess of 300 billion dollars that is the as I recall about the size of our entire military budget let's come true that's just to clean up one nuclear power plant catastrophe 300 billion dollars and and people talk about peacetime peaceful use of nuclear energy as a wonderful alternative to fossil fuels and various other things the thing is that when Reagan came into power there was a man named Dennis Hayes close friend of mine who is working for solar energy research institute and Colorado he was building is that now will the actually the chairperson for Earth Day interestingly enough Denis came out to visit and give a talk in Illinois just after the Reagan administration came in and Dennis I saw Dennis at the airport he looked kind of pale I've heard he had our time as to what was wrong he said well I've been fired and I said well what's going on and he said well the Reagan administration is going to dismantle and basically put out a business except for a little bit research all solar energy initiatives in this country and he's going to put in place atomic and nuclear energy honest that man Ronald Reagan our great president put us behind on environmental initiatives that we could have really put us ahead we could have gone ahead and prepared ourselves for an entry into the only kind of energy system that makes sense which is renewable energy source all the plants do it they depend on the Sun we depend on it in almost every way if we think about a little bit Reagan put us behind it at least a decade during a period when all the curves the crisis curves flowing out the Fed rate and I'm not sure we'll ever get past that period that he put us behind the ignorance the vast ignorance of that period people do not realize but it will come home to wrist and unfortunately in the near future the only way to go is a good strong renewable energy resource program which depends on things like solar wind small mini hydro plants and a variety of other sources that basically work with the energy of the earth and the energy of the Sun and can i generate enough to keep up a sustainable sonnet of love insurance he's John we've talked about these various separate different things that are ecological disasters and big problems we didn't even mentioning mentioned things like TV monitors and video display terminals which they start kids in kindergarten in first grade they radiate and can hurt hurt people I think they're kind of like many nuclear plants in that sense what well the first question is what can you tell us about that and the second question is all these things we've talked about they certainly must have some type of interacting synergistic relationship which to make all these worse right well the electromagnetic pollution is the subject to interest me very much because it has been relatively ignored I think we began to become aware of it when there was a lot of the the use of it as a military weapon I guess when the Russians were zapping the American Embassy in Moscow but in point of fact electromagnetic pollution is has become a major source of imbalance of the human body and in the mind the emotions in almost every American city it's interesting that direct-current tends to be a much smoother kind of electrical current than alternating current alternating current literally introduces jerky vibration into the human body and it lives near those fields and they're constantly going like this and pretty soon you start literally none at a very subtle level doing that too now if you live near high tension power lines high tension is probably a good word for it and you add on to that all the different kinds of radio and television and all the different kinds of waves which are constantly bombarding us my feeling is that we are it's having a major effect on the health of the energy body we're just beginning to realize from studies in Chinese medicine which again the American medical community would like to ignore but unfortunately acupuncture is so we'll proven by now that they had to acknowledge that in fact there are energy flows I'm having a treatment right now with an acupuncture a couple of acupuncture points for a bad tooth maybe when they began to see the pain control was so effective with Juran I began to see that certain kinds of Qi Gong and Tai Chi movement exercises were so beneficial in the hospital center of China they began to say okay there is something here and maybe there is something to this theory of energy flow through the meridians of the body the basic thing about electromagnetic pollution is that it completely imbalances the natural energy flow through those meridians of the body and I'm convinced it's one of the sources of dues about disease I mean disease is basically this ease lack of full bodily and mental and emotional ease and it seems like we've done everything possible to move out of that state and maybe not intentionally but if you think about it the human organism evolved over millions of years in nature surrounded by natural organic materials leading fairly natural food like nuts and seeds and tubers and leafy shoots and things of that kind probably some things from Jesus see and then oh we were living with relatively organic materials on our bodies with clean air and and environments which were very close to nature that was that was the way it was for millions of years we lived in relatively small extended family environments and tribal environments and we had people occasionally going out for periods of solo time to reconnect deeply with with nature and then would come back into the family we're so far from that now I mean everything in our life is totally artificial and the urban industrial era has only been with us for what several hundred years if you were to take a look at the tendency of human beings on the planet how long we've been here and that was an hour on a clock we're this urban industrial culture is just a tiny tiny fraction of a second for midnight and [Music] and we're using this we assume that this is the standard as if you know this is the way it always was and this is the way it always will be that's a vast illusion and this culture is not sustainable it will not last it is on the way out the question is what will replace it what will replace it depends entirely on the actions that we take now and in the future and it's one of the reasons that the ecological awakening is so important but the main point I wanted to make is that our whole being our emotions our body our mind evolved rikuo volved with the organic system and fabric of life of the planet over millions of years in a few hundred years we replaced that with a totally synthetic and artificial existence how can we possibly expect to be healthy emotionally mentally or physically it is no accident we're having diseases that are breakdowns of the immune system breakdowns of the basic cellular system like cancer cancer is behaving like we are it is simply chromatic control it's the reflection in our bodies of what we've become in relation to the planet so if you think about it cancer is a cell that is is does not regulate itself it grows without any control the cancer spreads it kills you it kills the body in a similar way it has created as only wants to consume the resources of the rest of the organs of the body the organ systems of the body it doesn't care it just wants to grow without limit the human being and it kills it kills it kills us the human being is growing on the planet with no regard for all the organ systems of the planet for mother Gaia it grows without any limit it will grow until the planet is dead that is how we were actually behaving so of course our bodies are now reflecting cancer which is simply the natural microcosmic reflection of behavior the behavior that we're inflicting upon mother earth or self so to talk about synergy which was your other question synergy by the way means synergy is where you look at the total netis of the interrelated effects of all the different actions and reactions of something and you may have let's say a cumulative effect of we have in our environment stresses coming in from driving to work four hours a day and beating on the steering wheel I was talking to somebody about it was a mechanic recently working with air conditioning units and I saw him down in Baja driving a Toyota and he said I said what do you what were you doing up there in California said well I I used to repair air conditioning units in San Diego and I liked it I said well why'd you leave and he said well too many years of driving on those freeways to get bigger and bigger and more and more stressed out I began to see people literally going crazy on the road there pounding you hear about the you know the shooting what you're doing here about is the thousands if not millions of people screaming pounding on the steering wheel or trying to bottle it all up inside you don't hear so much about that but that's what's going on and you take that kind of stress you add it to chemical pollutants you add it to pesticides you add it to poor nutrition and so on and the cumulative impact of all that did you take in together is synergistic if that means that when you add one kind of toxin to another toxin you get something usually that's far more toxic than just one thing alone most of our tests of the effect of environmental pollutants or poisons of one kind or another Veta physiological stress or a literal toxin Thaksin is single factor analysis it means that we don't look at the total system and the total range of impacts that are working on that system simultaneously as they actually do in nature in the actual world and through the single factor analysis the EPA and the rarest engines of government set their standards for what's allowable in terms of a pollutant for example there's no interest in finding out what the sum total of all that is if you took each one of those impacts and and took a look at the the impact of that on a human being or an animal another kind of animal I should say there's no question that the cumulative impact would be far greater than the single factor alone far far greater a quantum shift greater and we are not measuring for that nowhere in government nowhere in science and yet that's what's actually going on it's amazing and now we want to talk about what we can do what we must do in order to group to prevent all these catastrophes or less maybe heck maybe Homo Sapien and worth it maybe we should just you know shuffle off and give things back to the to the good animals of the world but anyway for going to do something I guess we have to look at Earth in a different way than we have in the past and do you have that some other people are doing this aren't you yeah I think simile hopeful signs one of the things that is particularly interested me is the growth on the one hand of a different philosophical view of what the human being is and what the earth is and the relationship of the human being to the earth and also to the the matter in the mother might air the earth that we live with right here in our bodies and there's a new of a friend of mine Jim Lovelock has been working for some years with a close friend of his they came up with a theory entitled the Gaia hypothesis several years ago Gaia yes got expelled because GA ia ji and basically this hypothesis says that the earth is behaving like a living organism and that may be sound a little radical to those people that tell our thinking about the earth is basically just a bunch of stuff out there you know a resource system that you go and exploit and you pull stuff in and you transform it into your BMW but in point of view the earth has been here much longer than we have it gave birth to us in our species we've been here maybe a million a couple million years the earth has been here for billions and billions of years and we don't really know what the earth is it's a great mystery we have something that we call science but just imagine if if our whole culture were a little cluster of cells somewhere down on the left side of the liver and that little cluster of cells was trying to figure out what is this what is this that I'm living within hmmm it would be very difficult it would probably be give particularly if it was a series of cancer cells living on the liver and starting to grow it would probably view the rest of this body that it was living within and on as simply a rather convenient kind of mass of organic stuff do utilize an extract stuff from for its own growth and then it would prove put together a philosophical system that would you know fit that view of unlimited growth of an egocentric view of the species now the eco-centric view eco-centric guru basically says that well the earth is a living organism it's alive just as the human body is it's a vast body of which we are part we're cells in that great body all the living beings in that body have different roles and interrelationships that play a part within the that great body of Mother Earth some of them are acting like different tissues some of them are acting like different organs of the body like the tropical rainforests and the oceans are producing the oxygen and helping to uptake some of the carbon dioxide and maintain the atmospheric cycles and the rainfall cycles and so on and so forth Oh basically the self-regulating behavior of the whole planet so that all life is supported is what AIA is all about and what the Gaia hypothesis is all about the original idea came about when they discovered that the oxygen levels of the planet were exactly maintained at that level that if went any higher the if you had a forest fire you could not put it out they were just everything would combust if it went down below that level at a time we wouldn't have enough to respire properly and somehow over millennia it has maintained a perfect oxygen equilibrium for the perfect maintenance of all the different species of the earth and when Lovelock took a look at all the different possible mechanisms for this he came to the conclusion that the only way the earth can do this is through a basic self-regulation system that would be just like how the human body self release regulates itself to maintain the equilibrium and the homeostasis and stability of the body as well as the growth of the overall bunny oh this is a revolutionary idea of course then they went ahead and began to examine that principle that hypothesis in light of evolutionary theory and they found the same thing began to hold true again and again they found principle examples within evolutionary biology that that basically pointed the same truth that the earth was behaving like a living organism so suddenly we're beginning to move into a view that says is saying something very different than what our forefathers said that the earth is just dead thing but interestingly enough with a few species living on it to happen to be you know to survival of the fittest and all that kind of craziness doing what they're doing we've never really given much attention to the interconnectedness of life the symbiotic cooperative nature of life but of course it probably began in a fairly small way and then somehow managed to grow out into this rather amazingly interconnected and mutually supporting system and cooperation probably has been about at least 90% of that process then there's competition in there too but competition is just the flipside of cooperation the two are completely intertwined just like the Enna's is a part of the young and the young is a part of the end so in a sense I think for the first time we're beginning to look at life as a and of the earth itself as a guest organic being whose intelligence we can't there's no way to even begin to you and speak of that because it's beyond us it's beyond us to know what that is or isn't but what we can say is that the a of the living process of the earth the flow of you might say of the life force through the organ systems and the tissues of the planet are definitely behaving just like a body of course now the earth evolved itself how does this hypothesis into the various stages of the earth the Aleutian knew the earth that's a very interesting question because it occurred to me the other day that nowhere does the human being fit into all of this are we destined just to be cancer you know are we the Earth's cancer is that it it's an interesting question and if we take a little more up to this view some people would say oh no what I mean we may be the cancer now but actually were destined to be the intelligence I was a planet I love that one if we were truly the intelligence of the pilot I doubt we would become the cancer of the planet I think it's more likely that we represent a highly developed ego structure for the planet you might say with the planetary ego we're the sense of separate self we're the part of the planet that can say we are here and everything else is out there subjectivity young and but that's more the principle of modernity started beyond the Renaissance and the era of capitalism and Protestantism right tied in with that that also at that time the vision of the human is the master of the earth exactly which you have also in the Bible but the command to go and master and conquer you have dominion right dominion over all in the fields of flowers etc the interesting thing is that if we look on ourselves as the the development of the ego structure for planet Earth which is my personal theory it may be that the next phase forth since we've been caught up in being very egotistical as a for quite a while and manifesting that that new exploration of what Earth herself is and exploring that for Earth maybe the next step is actually to join with other really the step beyond which is where the ego structure begins to see how yes there is separation and self-identification but there is also tremendous interconnectedness also a level of ended indivisibility a level of which we're all in great being again and obviously most interestingly if we are to survive as a species or maybe if the earth ourself is to survive at least in the organic richness that she now manifests we may have to go through that transition into valuing all the species and all of life in the same way that we value our own life and the life of our own species is in other words we'll have to make that philosophical leap and gives that same value to other forms of life that we give to our own if we're actually going to survive ourselves and that's a curious thing is you think that Homo sapiens is the first species that is Paris has a parasitic relationship with Mother Earth rather than symbiotic and is this a fatal flaw that's a hard question to answer I mean we've had so many of many other species that have been here and going extinct like the dinosaurs dinosaur species and so on but I think we can say that there are other systems of vast intelligence on the planet right now I've spent a lot of time with the whales and the Dolphins and there's no question that those those animals are beings of tremendous intelligence when you think about a a frontal brain system that we identify with rational consciousness and intelligence that is so much larger investor than ours that you can put the brain of some of those things who would fill an entire pickup truck compared to our brain and their communication system is so incredibly complex as I click that is alone as an indication of intelligence and they're vastly superior to us the feeling I've often got from spending time with whales down in Baja where I do these these wilderness solos in some that their intelligence is oh I guess an analogy would be to say it's like a galactic level awareness of course the Dolphins the purposes are extremely intelligent too but they're a little more I have a feeling a little more accessibility somehow there's a tremendous open hardness to the whales and the Dolphins both when they come in when folks go out and do a wilderness solo down there and we've been doing this solo so that people can make a deeper connection with nature directly heading out by themselves any out by themselves and basically spending seven days after three days of doing some awareness training together and then they go out for seven days they're completely alone but but it's comfortable and they stay completely present working with their senses to connect deeply with the truth of what's in the environment without any Theory just experiencing and what they experience is particularly for some of the political and social leaders that have gone through this process is absolutely amazing one man went through this recently as leader of a major technological university publishing house and when he came back he was his entire view of what the world was but did what earth is the diak quality of earthy organic beingness of Earth and his placement had changed and he has started up a major ecological publishing magazine and is going to host two major conferences on Gaia through this university which up until now has been largely focused on technology and industrial development that's the kind of impact that a direct connection without any particular theories with mother earth can have if you just go direct and that's of course the kind of thing that the Native Americans did through their Vision Quest and I think it's no accident that the Native Americans because they had the Vision Quest were able to cultivate they would go out at least once in a lifetime and usually three or four times or the medicine people would go out sometimes once a year and because that direct perception linked them with with levels of truth that one can only know by going through the experience out of that truth came the kinds of values we talked about the Ethel on the last program which said we will make no major changes in in the earth and in our local earth unless we know that will be beneficial to all of our children and all beings out to the seventh generation that's a value system that really understands the working so the planet and honors it so the reason we've been doing these these wilderness solar programs is to basically reintroduce that kind of a process into our culture so that we can create a different kind of value system which will have that kind of a organic wholeness to it and in John what kind of practical ecological measures come out of the gaia philosophy to preserve our earth we talked earlier of the pollution and depletion of the air of the soil of the water of the oceans what sorts of measures does this sort of philosophical meditation lead to to preserve these aspects of our natural environment if you some people call this deep ecology I prefer just to call it the ecological view or since it's a sacred view because you you have a tremendously sacred feeling about life after you go through this kind of experience the what happens is you no longer can view your your own life or the life of the other beings of the planet as something apart from you you literally feel connected to everything it's not that to say that you're totally caught up in in unity but it's to say that you feel completely interconnected you feel the relationship with all beings and you begin to perceive all beings as having meaning and direct relationship to you and you to them again it becomes more like family now when you begin to have a relationship like family with all the different ends of the earth your values shift when your values shift then you begin to place priority on things like well if I build a power plant down here or I'm going to put a nuclear power plant over here or I'm going to put an industry over there that's polluting the river it's going to kill all my brothers and sisters who live in that river it's going to kill part of me what I'm connected to my part of my family the Native Americans called the the plants and they have the four-legged sand and the wicked people and the stone people and they saw everything in that way as family I feel that this kind of a process particularly for a widespread a basic part of our education the wilderness solo or the Vision Quest that it would completely change the way in which we relate to nature and that all of our laws all of our the way that we create technology would shift we would then say well obviously we're going to have technologies that work in harmony with the whole fabric of life that's important that we value that we place that just as important as social security Jon we only have about ten minutes we want to talk about what needs to be done we talked about a need to change philosophically but the world isn't a very philosophical place when you talk about multinational corporations and capitalism and banks and social Eastern Europe and the government's they've had their Stalinism all just destroying the earth for power and profits and production from the things you've told us last time we're facing incredible disasters we must take enormous steps immediately I would assume there's a lot of levels for hope I personally feel that one of the best things that people can do is to take direct action in their own lives on issues that have they have a direct relationship with I mentioned last time that they work that we did to stop I measure copper smelter in Arizona that was directly affecting polluting the air of everyone in southern Arizona everyone living in this country has issues directly affecting them in their lives today and I'm a strong advocate of taking direct action to to make the changes if government is resistant to the kinds of changes that need to be made get together with your friends and take a direct action go ahead and chain yourself to a bulldozer if necessary the main thing is when you take a direct action and you make a statement like that a very strong statement put your life on the line if you do that to keep a good compassionate heart a good ecological warrior has a loving heart Gandhi always honored and respected his opponents and saw the basic humanity of them underneath but he was a warrior at the same time he took the courageous action he put his life on the line where necessary and I'm saying this because I feel that ecological activism is on the rise people are really fed up and there's a danger that activism could fall into the pit of becoming filled with anger and hatred then we would just be in the situation of the Lebanon or the Middle East we have all the factionalism and the fundamentalism and the hatred only feeds on itself so it's very important for activists to radiate compassion and love to their opponents at the same time they're taking the action there needs to be a real understanding this it's not easy if you're sitting there change of a tree and the logger is coming at you with it with a chainsaw with hate in his eyes but it's good practice that at another level there are many many actions that people can take in your everyday life there are all kinds of shifts that you can make to bring solar energy into your into your home to bring recycling into your household to bring a reduction with a simpler lifestyle into your life if you live more simply you'll have lower taxes you'll have fewer worries have fewer possessions to worry about I I'm amazed when people go out and solo the one thing they tell me consistently is and what in them when I go back John I'm going to simplify my life tremendously because I realize for the first time that I really don't need very much to be happy because these people go out with basically nothing and spend a week was nothing and realized that they're blissfully happy just being in nature with nothing so why do they tie themselves up and knots back in the cities to support all this stuff which is making them unhappy basically they're suffering as a result of their stuff so lonely sexist you you simplify your stuff and you boil it down to a more centralized form of living that's that's in harmony with nature and reduce your consumption if we can reduce our consumption we could dramatically reduce our impact on the environment the United States is consuming probably close to half the world's resources we have what 5% of the world's population I've seen estimates as high as 60 percent of the world's resources Jim what about on the sort of national and even global level these environmental problems are global the air the water the earth all of these ecological systems are interconnected so what can people do to stop pollution on a more national level well one of the things that I've been doing give you another practical example there there are some very good organizations doing important work Rainforest Action Network San Francisco is an excellent group working on the tropical forest issues our threshold foundation has something called the environmental crisis fund at the philosophy behind that is to basically have people tie the portion of their they'll say their salary their gross salary and then that salary and maybe five percent of their gross salary goes directly into environmental crises where a small amount of money can have a powerful impact usually if you're trying to get a grant for a project you're at you may sit back and try to get that money for a year if you're going through a federal agency or a major foundation very often rainforest is lost before you can raise the money to do it about it so we thought it was important to have a fund that can I could immediately provide cash immediately to help support flying for example a rainforest person perhaps in a tribal elder from the rainforest to testify before a congressional hearing in Congress maybe an appropriations committee meeting that was that's that's being called on whether or not to give a big hunk of money to the World Bank to build a dam that will flood the rainforest where that man lives and it has to be done within a week so you can put your own energy your work and your help towards those kinds of outfits and you can certainly help them through your through your financing I think it's very appropriate to tithe yourself and help out the environmental organizations that are doing such hard work today when you look at the amount of money going into all of the other often very socially questionable causes and you look at the poverty of the environmental movement I think it's about time we at least tide ourselves five or ten percent for the earth and is there enough of an environmental movement to save the environment at this stage in history it's building I don't think we're anywhere close to having a sufficiently powerful movement to to solve what's ahead of us that's why I'm saying we have to really get to work we don't have the power the people have the power the ones who are benefiting on the short term from exploiting the earth and destroying it are these people getting increased sense of consciousness consciousness in a few cases perhaps but there's a tendency for folks that handle to have a lot of power to hold on to their power at any cost and uh my own feeling is that at this point in time we have to put a tremendously strong pressure on all of the channels of change in government corporations government George Bush claims he's the environmental president earlier show you critiqued Ronald Reagan for his disastrous ecological policies do you see any shift in Bush or is this just rhetoric I think Bush is a much more enjoyed politician and he basically reads the currents of and the winds of change says the right thing and then does what he really wants to do hind the scenes just to develop what's a wide for example I saw in the paper today that yesterday he made a big pronouncement about how wonderful Earth Day was the next day what did the Interior Department do it went out and announced that it was opening up a whole new spectrum of oil leasing opportunities along our coasts I mean what does that tell you judge the man by his actions not by his words what would you be your final message to the American people out there place the environment first in your life at least for the next 20 years make that number one and put your energy a good hunk of your time and tide yourself some of your your money your income to put directly towards turning things around and come in the creation of ecologically sustainable society and not just helping your own immediate life in your neighborhood and your town and your County in your state a region in your bio region but also putting something into helping the global issues of tropical deforestation the true this destruction of the oceans which is upon us I mean we're just beginning to address the tremendous loss of the oxygen producing plankton that we have in the oceans we're seeing the need for having all of our fleets of oil tankers I think triple hulls not just double hulled and we need to do something about the unbelievable overfishing", "Hf7Ek0W3hFY": "what's up everyone welcome to today's video in the video today we are going to be going over the our low pro 3 and comparing it to the our low pro 2 and the our low ultra so stay tuned hey real quick I want to let you guys know that we are going to be doing an our low pro 3 giveaway at the end of this video so stay tuned for that all right back to the video I shot this morning so about a month ago I posted my initial thoughts on the Arlo pro 3 opened it up took a look at it got some test shots for you guys and asked you what you wanted to see it compared to the ultra or the pro 2 it's pretty much even between the two cameras so I decided that since I've got both of them let's just compare all three cameras together in this video so that's what we'll be doing today I've got the cameras all set up here on the fence shooting out to the yard so we're going to be able to get some ideas on what the audio sounds like what the color difference is one thing to note too is that prior to this weekend so me shooting this video right now the Arlo pro 3 has been having some issues with color it seemed very muted I actually spoke to Arlo about this they have improved the color on here so the color does look better however it doesn't look as saturated as the pro 2 so the pro true is a very saturated picture it would look good if that's something that you want to be posting on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that but the reality is it's just oversaturated it is not realistic one thing Arlo said is that they want to try to make their colors as realistic as possible and not some oversaturated video like the pro 2 is I asked them if they were planning on fixing the colors for the pro 2 they said as of right now that is not something that they are working on but at least for the ultra and the pro 3 they were trying to get those as true to the natural color as possible and looking at the footage I'd have to agree that those are probably more realistic in colors compared to the pro 2 so you know what before we start comparing all these cameras together let's head into the office take a look at the pro 3 compared to the other cameras and see what offers okay so I wanted to talk a little bit about to the Arlo Pro threes and exactly what they're offering in comparison to the pro two and the ultra so if we take a look at the front of this we see that it has a spotlight in front of the camera it's got the much better audio like the ultra has because if you guys haven't noticed before during the testing at the pro two has awful audio so much better audio here on the back we have the standard mounting screw back here and then on the bottom we've got the charging port I mean I guess charging port is what we'll call it that is magnetized and waterproof so you just have to bring the magnet close up to here and it will automatically connect which is really nice and then we've got the button to open up the case now this thing has what they're calling a catch so if the camera is pointing like this and you want to take it out without taking it down you push the catch on the bottom and if you notice the camera popped out enough to where I can grab it and pull it out but it hasn't fallen out so now that we have the shell off inside here we've got the battery so the battery is here these are the same batteries as the ultra so different from the pro two so this is going to be very similar to the Arlo Ultra and then on the where is it's on the bottom here we have the sync button so you're going to use that to sync it with the base station and the main difference between this and the ultra is that this is a 2k camera or the ultra is going to be a 4k camera and then we also have the pro 2 which is a 1080p camera so out of this new design my favorite part about it is the new charging port if you guys have used the pro 2 you know how difficult that can be to try to get the cable in there and then also make sure that no moisture gets in there because it is an open to these circuits but this right here I absolutely love you just get it close enough it automatically connects and you don't have to worry about water getting in there it is so much better than the pro 2 one thing that I am NOT a fan of though with the new system here is that it's not magnetized in the back anymore so at least with the old pro 2 you could it take that and stick it to things that were metal and not have to connect amount unfortunately for this even though it is much heavier in the back with all of that metal in there it is not magnetic so you do have to use some kind of mount to connect this to another question that I keep saying a lot of is does this come with free cloud storage and I'll tell you it does not it only comes with 30 days of their smart subscription which gives you 30 days of cloud storage in addition to a few other things I think that there are low smart feature what it'll do is it will analyze your data and tell you if that is a person vehicle an animal or an other I believe it is and it'll send you notifications with that category already selected one thing that's nice about that is for example I have one at my front door pointing out I have a lot of activity in front of my house and I've only selected to get notifications when a person is detected so normally I would be getting dozens of notifications throughout the day because of all the cars passing in front of it but I'm only getting notifications on my phone when it is a person now there is a recording for everything that happens is just the notifications only if it detects a person do I get a notification so that helps a lot with they're just being floods of notification on my phone so I actually like that feature the problem with the smart subscription is that you have to pay three dollars a month for per camera that is or you can pay $10 a month and that will cover I believe it's up to five cameras I'll put a number up here to show you guys what it actually covers with that ten dollars a month but the one problem with that is when it detects something it has to then upload that footage to their servers analyze it detect what it is person vehicle animal or other then it sends you the notification so I've noticed that the notification takes about 15 seconds to actually pop up on your phone which a lot of people don't like but I would say that now that I've been using it for a while I actually really like the feature I'm not just getting flooded with notifications all day long I am actually only getting notified when it's a person and I would say that accuracy wise it's about 90 95 percent accurate it's almost able to detect a person every time one thing though that I will mention is that especially in my backyard when it's windy I'll get a lot of times where it categorizes it as an animal I go back and I look I don't see any animals it's not like there's a bird flying through the shot or anything like that so the one where it's trying to detect if it's an animal or I guess a random object that one's kind of a miss so if you're planning to use that notify if you you for an animal if it's a windy day that one's not as good but for the person one I really like that one so a couple other things that that are included with this camera is that it does have the colored night vision will show you some examples of that but if you don't want the spotlight to turn on it does have the normal night vision also this does shoot in 2k and it has the HDR which is much improved from the Ehrlich Pro - that allows you to get a dynamic range in the darks and the lights so you're able to see both where in the pro 2 there was a lot of times where the sky would be blown out or other things if they were too bright would get blown out in the picture but the HDR really helps with these new cameras we've also got the two-way audio like I mentioned before the integrated spotlights these do have built in sirens although they are not very loud the viewing angle is a hundred and sixty degrees and like I mentioned before it does have the magnetic charging port on the bottom and rechargeable batteries okay so in addition to all of the changes between the pro 2 and the pro 3 on this camera we have had some changes in the base station here so now the space station looks a lot more like the ultra base station the problem with the ultra base station is that you had to have an SD card they got rid of the USB port in the back of that which was a big disappointment to a lot of people I am happy to say that for the pro 3 the USB port is now back here you can either plug a thumb drive or an external hard drive into this however the SD card slot is gone so you don't have an option between the two of those for the pro three it is now only the USB ports on the back and I will say because of that USB port that I have actually stopped using the base station for the ultra I have actually connected all of my cameras into the pro 3 version and now everything is running off there with an external hard drive plugged in to be backing up all of the footage onto this guy ok so now that we have covered the hardware for those of you who are new to the Orla system let's quickly go over the app and I will show you some of the features of there and then we will jump into the comparison footage of the cameras okay so we have the app loaded up here the top video that you're seeing that is my Arlo pro 3 and then below that I have the or low ultra cameras but if we take a look here under the probe 3 we can see that we have a battery life we have Wi-Fi signal we have the audio if you want to do your 2-way talk and then right next to that that circle with the lines is if it has any kind of motion so right now with it being black or kind of a grey there's no motion but if it was yellow that means it would be detecting a motion next to that the 65 that's how many notifications it has had since I last checked it and then next to that is that little gear wheel so we can click on there to dive into the different settings here get a little bit more in depth in there we can go ahead and check video settings so we do have to cable live streaming turned on auto zoomin tracking I am NOT a fan of that I don't turn that on so that is off you rotate the camera upside down we've got low lights right now have a spotlight off it would turn the spotlight on you can see that you can have a color night vision on we've got the brightness and all that stuff we're gonna back out of here go to power management I have it for the testing set to best video and then the video modes you can see the different angles that you have here so field of view we've got that set up right there so if we back out of all of this you can also set up activity zones you can click the plus arrow up here and you can name each zone if you wanted to you can drag those around change the size of all of those and back out of here you can also go to your audio settings so here are your different audio settings and I think the last one here is device utilities so you can set up camera position here and then you can also do the motion detection test so that's another thing that you can go through alright and then also if we look at the tabs on the very bottom we see the libraries so here's the library of all the different shots that we have we can go through the different days up on the top we've got modes here so depending on what you have set up like I mentioned I'm not even using my ultra hubba any more I'm just using the pro three hub so here are some different things if you want to set up you can set up arm disarm schedule geofencing I've been using the geofencing one a lot that's a nice one back out of here and then we can go to settings where you can change some of the different settings here but now that we've covered the app really quick let's jump outside and start comparing these cameras together and see what they look like the cameras that we have here so we've got the arlo ultra the our low pro 3 and our low pro 2 first thing in the morning on all of these cameras all right so now we are going to be doing an audio test this is the our low ultra we're doing a test this is 10 feet away I'm going to slowly be backing up and talking so you can tell what the audio sounds like we're all the way up gonna be about 30 feet away right here so we have 30 feet away from the ultra and this is what the quality sounds like and the video altra all right now we have the all right this is the proof three with the spotlight turned on now so this is what you can see with the colored night vision let's take you back all right so there we have it 10 feet away now we're back to 30 you think all right so here is the ultra width D coordinate vision on all right this is the Arlo proof - we're testing it it has no colored night vision so this is just the regular IR night vision on this all right this is a test of our low point three we're testing it out with the night vision no spotlight on this one this is the probe three alright here we have the our little ultra so this is the ultra camera and we are 10 feet away and take it all the way back and see what it looks like yeah hey everyone back in the house did you want shoes I took baths kids okay let's go alright so I think that we have compared most of the big topics with these three cameras right here for the sake of time I'm gonna cut it off right there and give you guys my final thoughts on this camera so initially when I did the unboxing I thought that this camera was gonna be exactly the same as the ultra except it was a hundred bucks cheaper and just had two K quality after doing the testing I didn't notice and I don't know if the quality will actually come through to you guys in this YouTube video because of the downgrading and everything but the Arlo Ultra was noticeably better in audio in quality of video color accuracy I noticed was all better with the Ultra now these are some things that can be updated and firmware so maybe they will be doing that down the road and as far as the pro 2 other than that seven days of free cloud storage and the oversaturated image that I will admit it looks great but it is not true to color compared to these cameras here so I leave it up to you guys to decide at which camera is gonna be best for you and we'd like to know in the comments which camera you liked the best which ones do you have or which ones are you looking to get let me know in the comments below I'd love to hear from you but now that we have gone through all of this let's talk about the giveaway I've been

be doing some OpenCart surgery I'm just kidding we launched we've all been there a kit that is gonna take care of a problem that I know everybody who's in oil vaporizers has encountered which is your vaping your favorite cartridge and all of a sudden it stops working or you're vaping it down to where oil is no longer going into the orifice holes and you have a bunch of your valuable oil stuck at the bottom of the cartridge or your heater gives out or your disposable runs out of battery life but you have a cartridges no longer functioning which still has some of your precious oil CBD e-juice terpenes whatever and you want to try to excavate them so what honey stick did it was we made it really easy for you by launching our oil recovery kit which is everything that you need to help get a non-functioning cartridge that still has valuable oil in it out of the kit in today's episode we're gonna briefly run through the contents of this kit and how to use it to excavate oil out of your cartridge now just to backtrack a little bit the way that that we got this idea is actually one of our authorized distributors and my buddy Darrell over a rich mountain distribution he sent me a picture which I'm gonna make the video guy find and put up here on the YouTube screen as it said modern-day roaches and it showed a bunch of vape cartridges that are you know like quarter full or half full and not working laying around like you know people would have these Roach jars of these little collections of people have these little graveyards of non-working cartridges and vape accessories with oil left and so I was like man I showed that a couple of our employees just to get a laugh out of it and they were like oh I have one of those I have one of those I was like wow you know everybody must have one of those so let's make something to try to bring those non-working vape devices or the valuable contents in them back to life hence our oil recovery kit and let's make it affordable and easy to use so oil recovery kit available on WWE stay calm is gonna be selling for under ten bucks if you use the promo code that I'll give you guys at the end of the video you get an extra couple bucks off so let's jump right into what the kids contents are and how we generally use it so just to come this real simple plastic container which a lot of stores that because we whole sale and distribute a lot can have them just hanging in the stores so they have a little hanger here you're gonna get your kit you're gonna have your contents of the kit on the back let's get a little close-up so two filling syringes four blunt tips two syringe caps and some VG PG solution so let's go ahead and jump right in you just gonna open your kit and it's gonna slide right out you're gonna have a nice tray to keep all your stuff organized in and you're gonna have a really nice large instruction card here that basically explains very simply how to use this kit but we're gonna go through all this in the video so let's even though I briefly ran off the contents let's go through what we have here so you have two syringes these are two medical grade plastic syringes that you can use and this is used for excavating or rejecting your oils now these syringes they have a thread on them right in here which you will screw your your syringe blunt tip the into nice and firmly to pull pull the oil out or to re-inject the oil and when you're not using it if you have any oils in them you're gonna have these syringe caps right here which you're going to be able to use to seal up your syringe to make sure that you have no leaking all right so let's go through what type of blunt tips we have and what really they're used for on this side over here you have different you have different lengths of syringe needles because you're gonna have different cartridges and different devices where you might have to get down either deeper into the device or you might need a skinnier device to work with because certain cartridges for example they have a center post which doesn't give you that much space along the edges so you might need a skinnier needle to fit down in there or with certain cartridges you might have a thicker oil that you need a wider gauge needle just so that you can draw it out so here we have our thinnest gage oil and I'm going to use this just to kind of pry out here you have a very thin gauge needle let's get a close-up of that this is like a teal green color in our kit very thin it's about a about an inch in length the the shaft here is about an inch and a half and then no it's about an inch and it has a very thin opening you're not going to want to use this for any oils that are really thick you would mainly want to use this for thinner terpenes or for very thin oils or for CBDs or even for a liquid if you have it trapped in a cartridge don't use this for thicker oils and you might also be forced to use this if you have a very thin area between a cartridge and a center post to excavate your oils so this is a needle used for those devices now if we come down here to the gray needle blunt needle tip you'll notice it is slightly wider but the shaft here is only about half an inch now what you would use this for is you'd use this for slightly thicker oils or CBDs cartridges that aren't very deep because when you get down inside the cartridge the oil is more than likely to be trapped around the bottom so this would be more for larger tanks that have very open areas Torrey you can actually put the whole needle down in there to excavate your oil and this is also a good needle tip that is used for dispensing oil so once you've recovered your oil from being able to shoot it back into your cartridge because it's a very small it's a very agile you know you can you can point it down into places you don't have to worry about using something that is much longer that might be a little bit clumsy or when you're dispensing your oil so that's what you would use this needle for here it's a blunt needle tip so here we have four even thicker oils you have your kind of a kind of a Shrek green colored cartridge here or you know like a little Oscar the Grouch shade you have a thicker needle with a longer base this is gonna be for also for excavating out much thicker oils so the thickness and the needle you're gonna use for what type of thickness of material you're trying to draw out of your cartridge so make sure that you use the right and you know because if you have too thick of contents you use too thick of a needle it is just not going to draw out or it's gonna be very difficult so you have this needle is slightly thicker then if you come over here to the very far end you have a needle that's slightly thinner but longer so this is probably gonna be one your go-to stand that's why we showcase it because it's nice and long so you can get down inside cartridges it's not overly thick but the ring gauge of this needle is thick enough so it's gonna be all draw up a lot of the the thicker oils or sludgy oils now the other thing that we have that we explained here earlier is your needle covers they're gonna cover your syringes these don't cover the actual blunt needle tips but they will screw in once you've drawn oil out and you you're gonna store a syringe for later use you simply screw it in to the syringe and then it's sealed it makes a nice airtight you don't have to worry about leakage or anything like that you can put it up for storage now here we have some pg/vg solution now before my purists jumped into the comments section of this this video and start saying you don't want to mix out with your oils this is really only to be used in circumstances that you cannot draw the oil out that is too thick you cannot heat up the oils it's not it's not going to come out or there's just too little oil in there so what you would do is you would take some of this pg/vg which is available and you take it you put some into your cartridges close the cartridge up mix it around it'll give you something to draw out because if you're saving oil saving some oil and being able to vape it is better than being able to save no oil and vaping it so this is only really to be used in very difficult circumstances where you're not able to draw your oil or there's not as much oil in there to draw out it's really just you you add it in there you mix it around let it sit for a little bit and then you would go on with your excavation process so there's really for emergency situations where you would have something difficult to draw now let's go into what the procedure would be we're gonna do some much more specific videos of some of the customers if you guys can drop into the comments section below what cartridges you guys have had difficulty with so we can get the type of cartridge and make specific videos for how to excavate oil out of those cartridges that would be really helpful to us and we can make some really specific videos for other people who are having problems with and getting oil out of a specific cartridge how myself or James would go in there and go about maximizing the amount of oils you can salvage out of your cartridge that fail but I'm just gonna run through a real general kind of basic procedure of what you want to go through when you're looking at any cartridge to save some oil and as you guys comment we'll make some more specific videos and get them up here on the channel for you so first thing you want to do is you want to have your cartridge now I have these little styrofoam blocks in our shop because when we're buying a lot of cartridges that are made of glass it's really safe to ship them in these but what you want to do is you want to have a cartridge and you want to have it standing upright on a surface where you can get at it and perform a little bit of perform your excavation process without worrying about the cartridge falling over there falling out of your hand and breaking so these things are just really useful to have you can really easily just cut out a piece of foam or whatever use a small vise or something but you want to have your cartridge standing upright in on a stable area to where you can use both of your hands and not really worry about what you're gonna do this was actually a child lock cartridge so it's locked but you want to have it to where you can access it you can see it and you can use both hands to jump in and perform what you have to perform in there second of all most these oils especially colder temperatures a thicker before you start any excavation process you want to get your oil as viscous as possible you want you want that liquid to flow okay and be as thin as possible so you can pull it out easier so what I recommend is once you have it sitting there get a hairdryer and heat up the cartridge if you're in a warm climate state we're in Florida a lot of you guys are in sunny you know Southern California you can simply just walk outside and leave the cartridge outside for a few minutes and it'll it'll get really nice and thinned out take a hairdryer if you're gonna use a lighter make sure you don't put the lighter directly on the glass or plastic or whatever you're drawing it out of because you could compromise the cartridge you could you know burn it you can have it react with your oils you can melt a plastic one so if you're using a lighter or something be extremely cautious to hold it at a safe distance so you're only using the outside of the heat cone to get your cartridge warm you don't need to get hot you just need to get it warm and then once you're your contents in there they're about as thin as they can be then you're gonna go through and you're gonna select the appropriate tool that is gonna fit down in there but still be thick enough to draw out your liquids if I have a thicker oil that I'm using then I want to make sure that I'm using a nice as we mentioned before a nice wider gage syringe tip blunt needle tip which we're going with Shrek green and you want to make sure that it's gonna fit between the center post this one does fit however because this has an edge here I might want to use something a little bit thinner just so I can really get down into there this one is gonna work a little bit better now the thing is is because this come this specific cartridge comes in so close here I'm never gonna fully get everything that is around the orifice holes I'm if I kind of heat and then I tilt it and I come in at an angle so you're gonna have to play around with each specific cartridge certain other cartridges you're gonna be able to just jump right in there but it really depends on where the where where the base where how the base is how the center post is and how big of an opening you have to work with not each cartridge is gonna be the same you're gonna have to tinker and tamper around with them a little bit which is why I'm really encouraging you guys to drop into the video section brand names of cartridges you guys seem to be having problems with so we can do really cartridge specific videos but I've taken our performer tank for example which has a really open surface that you can get into so it's really not going to be picky as to which blunt needle tip you're gonna work down and get in there with okay and I've even had our sub-ohm which for example if you had a heat or go out and you're trying to pull your oils out I have it open here it's not gonna be picky you could basically fit the whole syringe in there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna select your proper cartridge make sure there's the needle plunger here that's what they call this a plunger it's completely pushed in okay then you could take this and you can make sure that's firmly screwed in there so it's locked in there then once you've made it down heat it up the cartridge you go down in there and you very slowly place the needle down to the bottom but you don't push it down to the bottom to where the needle cannot draw up the oils or get off air this works on air suction from you guys who aren't familiar with it and then you're gonna very slowly just draw up the oils don't reject them and draw them up so that when you're drawing it the oil doesn't get stuck here in the in the the syringe valve and the so as you draw it up the oil is gonna travel up here even if you see that you've pulled all the oils out give this an extra pull so you don't have any oils that are stuck inside the blunt needle tip because if you just take it out of the cartridge and you stop you stop withdrawing and you take this off you can have a significant amount of oil stuck in any portion of here so you want to make sure to keep drawing so the oil makes its way past the blunt needle tip as well as the base and makes its way into the syringe and once you've drawn it out take one of your syringe caps here with the kit take off your blunt needle tip you can drop this in the isopropyl alcohol right away to clean it if you do have some stuck in there then take whatever new cartridge you would be filling it in to use your other syringe [ __ ] it back a little bit screw it on and then push down and it will shoot the oil the air pressure will shoot the oil into whatever the little remaining oils into whatever cartridge you are placing it into so that's just a little tip there once you have this sealed you can store these syringes even though it says discard after use that is for safeties you don't want to be constantly you know mixing stuff but these are cleanable you do have to clean them after every use if you're gonna reuse them we will be selling extra bulk syringes on the website so you guys don't have to buy the whole kit at one shot we will be putting those up a little bit later but this should serve as a very useful kit for those of you who have experimented with cartridges or just any type of oils or CBD mixing or injecting you definitely want to have one of these definitely come in handy I mean we've already had half of our employees have already taken them to go work on their graveyard of cartridges so definitely get a lot of use out of this get it will be available on WWE stay calm make sure to LIKE this video if it was helpful make sure subscribe and on this

environments which may affect total carcass life and serviceability make it an inadvisable to prescribe arbitrarily the maximum number of times a high-speed tire should be retreaded this aspect therefore is controlled by a thorough inspection of the carcass before retreading question if an airplane equipped with master cylinders and single disc brakes have excessive brake pedal travel but the brakes are hard and effective the probable cause is answer worn brake lining question the correct inflation pressure for an aircraft tire can be obtained from answer the aircraft service manual question what should be checked when a shock strut bottoms during landing answer fuel fluid levels question how is it determined in a master cylinder brake system that all of the air has been purged from the system answer by depressing the brakes and noting the brake is firm and not spongy question the left brake is dragging excessively on an airplane on which no recent brake service work has been performed the most probable cause is answer foreign particles stuck in the master cylinder compensation compensating port question if a brake debooster is used in a hydraulic brake system its position in the system will be answer between the brake control valve and the brake actuating cylinder question the hydraulic packing seals used in a landing gear shock strut are answer used only with

for watching part three i'm gonna sign off you'll see part four next thanks you", "Yhwg7LaGK0g": "welcome back folks back to your macd garage and i have this 2005 toyota highlander limited clocking in about 175 000 miles give or take and i did struts all the way around and after i got done i had a bunch of lights so let's check out what lights i have and then uh maybe we can get it fixed for this much money wheel speed sensor what's the problem let's check it out now as you can see i have the low tire i have the abs and i also have a vsc uh don't pay attention to the blinking seat belt light because i got it running without seat belt on i'm not driving i'm just taking and checking this thing out now these lights did not appear until after i got done replacing the struts and uh what i did is i had to grind off the sway bar links and under this code as you see here in the inset it says metal on wheel speed sensor so i'm thinking all the grindings got onto the sensor and clogged it up so we're going to go ahead and take the wheel off and we're going to give her a good spurt with compressed air and maybe a little brake cleaner and whatever we can and we're going to see if we can't get this wheel speed sensor to function and then make all these lights go away so let's check it out and see if we can get a free fix out of this deal or do i have to replace the sensor well i was thinking it was going to be some metal but uh looks like this little gal ate her first rodeo uh somebody has been here before me and that feels a little weak right there so i guess i will take the tape off of here and what do you think a broken wire something is going on right here so uh let's go ahead take the tape off and see what kind of mess i'm gonna be dealing with do i need can i fix it or am i gonna have to buy this whole new wiring i know it's a good hundred bucks for this thing so i can see why they probably taped it they probably got another sensor someplace from a junkyard who knows and i went that route but let's go ahead and see what we can do now we gotta figure out how they have this taped up here hello i think we had a bird and ernie going on here bird and ernie's garage that ain't looking good there we go not sure where we're going with this what do you think folks there you go what kind of deal is that huh don't know yeah we got her broke ain't no saving this [Applause] this is broke right off that's where it's at right down here you can see try to tilt it down here nice and close right there so we are going to have to order a new sensor there ain't no fixing that uh it looks like it's just been through too many and it just broke off so we have to order a new uh sensor and it's a whole harness thing so we'll have to wheel our way through all that mess to get this fixed and replace the whole sensor so well i'll be right back with the new sensor everything seems to be in order this is the cable two connectors it's got a metal frame and it's zip tied to the metal frame connections and loops all look like they're supposed to be clip and then of course the sensor now when you put this in you want to make sure you got the right one so based on what i'm seeing right here it all goes up in like it's supposed to now i gotta take the wheel well cover off but it's gonna bolt right up and it's gonna loop around just like it's supposed to it's going to connect right here and then this will fit right like here and the sensor goes down like it's supposed to so overall it looks like it is the right fit for the right side now i have to remove the wheel well bolts you got one here one here uh i think you got one up here someplace got one here one here some others underneath so then a few fasteners here and there so we'll pull her off get it off of and i don't know if there's any up underneath but i'll check them out but this wheel well covers got to go off because it goes up underneath of it and i pulled the bottle out in this hole right here is where it comes out at but i have to remove the power steering reservoir to get access and i'm not even sure i can get my fingers in there so we're gonna shoot for the wheel well route to get it out but that would be one option if you wanted to avoid removing the wheel well i guess if you could somehow fish it in there and then out and get it connected good on you but we'll just take the wheel well off fairly self-explanatory i think i think they're all 10 millimeter we'll find out here shortly yep we'll just start taking them all out hope for the best and that one broke it looks like i got another one down here see if it's gonna break off from rust [Music] nope it came off and there's another keeper on there we're not gonna make this easy are they oh this one wanted to cooperate this is what broke off i might have some more of these in the toolbox here [Applause] that's all these are just little plastic expansions holding it in you know what that's all you need to do we got it down enough that we can actually see this so let me show you you don't need to take the whole thing off just this front part right there she is in all her glory that's all we need to disconnect so you only need to take you know a little bit of this apart you don't need to take the whole thing off but they gives you plenty of room to reach up in there and grab that thing as you can see the hole you can probably disconnect the whole thing and force it through and then reconnect it so it might be doable up through there but then you'd have to remove the power steering reservoir so six one way half does another i guess now let's go ahead and disconnect this you just squeeze on this end right here the gray piece let's push and it comes undone easy [Applause] and did this one here it's a 13. so we just undo that now we'll go ahead and do this one and it's a 12. [Music] helps if i don't go the wrong way there we go got that out this just done clips right here real simple now we'll get the sensor now we'll get this sensor off of here 10 millimeter pulls right out as you can see they had the broken wires somebody did a hack job on the repair cut it right off holy cow that thing was ready to go guess we just toss this bad boy back in here get the nut started there we go nice and tight for that let's get the rest of it going and this just slides right back into place snaps right in there so that's nice and taken care of and then nice and tight in there so got that done i'm gonna bend that just a little further away from this brake line uh i think we're set all we gotta do is tighten up this one here it's tight to do this connector and that is set put the wheel well back on and uh we will cover and we'll be all set to test her got her in everything is installed so now i guess the proof is in the pudding when i go to taking for for a drive let me show you the fasteners uh kit that i used to uh replace a few of these uh fasteners in here that were uh needing to be replaced like up in here in other areas that required them i have this kit and it has all sorts of different fasteners in it and it really does pay you can generally if you buy one of these kits they're cheap on amazon and they're a lifesaver when you lose a faster you can usually make one of these work good so little kits like this come in handy for all those little plastic fasteners that can break it's better than spending three or four bucks for two pieces at the auto parts store when you can spend 14 15 or whatever i paid for this for a whole kit so keep that in mind when you're working on your vehicle these fasteners break and it's nice to have a little kit like this handy now let's see if we got anything that [Applause] changes well that's a good sign no low tire no abs and no uh vehicle control code as far as traction control so let's take it for a spin maria is the car truck truck fixed for you now yeah toyota's good good all right all good all good folks check you next time thank you for watching mac t's videos and remember to like and subscribe this is a mercy girl production [Music] [Music] you", "-WNFJaF25Qg": "clear skies and welcome today we're going to be looking at a modification for rotatable ota rings for reflector and telescopes like this which is a mac newtonian or schmidt newtonian anything that really has the eyepiece hanging out at a 90 degree angle from the ota versus the standard caster grain or a refractor this is my six inch uh explorer scientific comet hunter what i'm going to be showing you is a modification that i read about on the internet and first things first here what we have to look at is how do the ota rings join together so this is obviously the cradle here you have the handle the two rings the important thing to know is some rings go together and these screws right here are actually you know cap heads where they stick out so what you want is you either need to drill a countersink drill them so they're perfectly flat and then do the same thing for this opposite side which luckily the explorer scientific rings are both flat here so that's what we want so what you're going to do is you're going to take a single ring this is another single ring that was made for the common hunter and what we're going to do is you just place it in front of the cradle you see the cradle is attached to the dovetail on this cgx mount and you're going to attach the new ring and you want to butt it right up against on both up and down you want to butt it right up against even just like that now what you're going to do is you're going to tighten this down all the way like you would uh you know if you were actually installing this on the cradle you want to balance the telescope first of course i always put it in this configuration first then balance it then i'll move this back to wherever it needs to be in relation to the cradle but now if we loosen the the axis here let me just turn it to a funky position so let's say you're trying to observe something that's right up overhead you can't quite get to it well the trick is now this acts as basically a hard stop so it the tube doesn't slide down through because when you loosen these two to adjust the ota this one can't move so if you have this one tight like it should be you pull these off and then your whole tube is able to rotate in its own assembly to your desired position and then you tighten these down and now you have the eyepiece over here now let's say you slew back to another position let's say now that you're you know over facing this direction and the mount is kind of like this where it's facing kind of towards the ground same thing you loosen these grab the ota i'm just using this because this is just easiest for the video rotate that optical tube tighten these guys back up that locks it down and there you have it there's rotatable tubes so that's the easiest modification you can perform usually rings are you know anywhere from 20 bucks all the way up to about 65 70 for just generic ones from orion or you know whoever sources them scope stuff etc this one i just happened to come across it was an actual explore scientific made for this telescope exactly the diameter of the ota that i needed but you can find anything as long as it just fits the ota properly and as long as you have enough you know grab on the ota to basically to hold it you're fine so real quick and easy modification super simple not uh doesn't cost all that much but adds a ton of functionality especially if you're using something like a gem like this to do visual observing because after you know the alignment on a gem sometimes that eyepiece is facing towards you know straight down towards the ground there's no way to get down there so hope you enjoy this hope you perform this on your telescope and it helps you guys all out thanks for

made out of anodized aluminum housing so they're pretty sturdy they have an LED indicator on top which lights up when you charge and when you use it let's see I'll show you the box and what's inside it so on the box you can see that it says there's the palm battery inside the microUSB charging cable to metal thread adapters and those will fit 510 threads this does recommend ac cell type battery I have used it with others but I'll definitely make sure it works before if you're afraid to not on the back it says it's Anil activated stealthy breathing LED indicator quality circuit board with multiple protection the battery size again and the Magnetic threads included and like I said they recommend the C cell cartridges for the best performance so it comes in gray blue and pink and as the microUSB once again I stay up pretty good oh yeah and the size is about the size of a chapstick would say a little bit shorter and a little bit skinnier where the battery is so they'll fit in a small pocket definitely fit in a palm of your hand which hence the name so let's see I'll show you what's inside the box here so you open it up and you've got the battery and then you've got this little cover with an instruction on the back it says to put the cartridge and thread adapter and then you put it in the battery and it seems simply stays down with the magnet of course it's in hell activated so you don't have to press the button you just inhale and it will provide vapor so in here you have the two thread adapter x' right here you're the micro USB cord and a battery itself also I believe there is a warranty card underneath and I think it's 180 days but I'm not positive on that so here's the battery that's where you'll put the thread adapter so here is a C cell this is a C sell em for 7-7 you take the thread adapter which I already had one out and you throw it on there like so pretty simple you guys can see that just threads on and off so you throw it on there and then you just simply place it in there and it'll be held by the magnet and then just to get it out you just pull it and then it will simply come out and there and it stays in nice and tight and then it's pretty discreet you can just put it in your palm if you don't want anybody to really notice and let's see if I can show you that LED indicator so I don't know if you could see that and it produces pretty heavy vapor as well and you know it's not too heavy or anything like that so and then I'll just show you that it works with the other types of cartridges as well here's the hop gram one that one was a gram one simply place it in there see if you can see though what led so it's pretty good it's very good actually and that's the blue right there what else it does have a ten-second time out when you're inhaling which is about normal most have like about a seven so it will start producing vapor at ten seconds but then you just stop and you can keep hitting it again if you still need to and I

want to document that on video so I'm using my regular video camera which is aimed in this direction from that side but I also wanted to have a secondary angle and I've been discussing this with my other videos on the action type cameras and I have this contraption here that I was able to put together and basically is out of GoPro accessories but I found this magnetic base on amazon.com and the beauty of it is that neodymium type magnet and you're gonna see how strong that is so what I do with this is once I have a configured to the angle that I need I attach the magnet to suppress this portion of my bench and then I just attach the camera to it and then I can simply adjust it the way I want it in this case I wouldn't want it like that in aim toward the bottom now keep in mind that this is sliding a little bit because that secondary magnet is supposed to be actually adhered to the column with the adhesive back it would stay put alright so so you can see this affords me the beauty of having a secondary angle and anything that I am building and that will give you a little bit more diversity to the video and I can switch back and forth during post editing give you a better look at what I am doing here alright so that's gonna be part of my future video production tech strategy and I hope it works out and produces better videos for all of you ok so if you like this please like it if you have any questions please ask below I can answer anything about these types of cameras and accessories that you might want to get into if you're doing this type of video yourself so

the C cell palm battery now this battery here has an all aluminum anodized exterior to it giving it a very sleek and minimalist appearance it's very unique in that is a drop in style sort of battery so it has a little metal connector here on the bottom of the cartridge that simply just gets screwed on and you can transfer this little metal connector here from cartridge to cartridge but once you place it on a cartridge you simply screw it onto the end of the cartridge here and drop it right into the battery it magnetically adheres to the battery does not come out and it allows you to adjust the mouthpiece position to any sort of orientation you prefer and it makes it so that once you use this battery you can simply place it in the palm of your hand and use it providing maximum discretion another thing that makes it very unique is the fact that it is Auto inhale activated meaning that it does not need push-button activation making it extremely simple for the beginning or advanced user to use another great feature of this battery is that it has passed through microUSB charging so and whatever you want to charge this battery you're simply going to flip it over and down here there is a microUSB charging port you simply insert your micro USB cord in here and then plug it into any USB outlet and you'll be able to charge this battery within about two hours in terms of branding options you can see that this battery has a very large back plate area as well as a front plate area both of which can be branded however you choose there's multiple different silkscreen and/or pad printing options that we can engage with up to a maximum of two to three different colors for your logo so this is a great battery it's brand new on the market it's actually 550 mah or mah meaning that the capacity of the battery is such that the typical user can probably use this battery for two weeks without even having to recharge it whereas the typical stixxay cell battery which is actually 350-mile will usually need to be charged after about one week of use but this battery is discrete sleek has passed through USB charging meaning that if it dies and you need to charge it you can actually use the battery while it's charging which is a very nice feature and it has a high capacity of 550 ma allowing you to use it for an extended period of time without having to recharge so there you have it the C cell palm battery available right now in blue black gunmetal gray or a champagne finish but there are other colors that will become available very soon please give us a call and ask

your phone and hook to a ball and that's how you hooked it up to your car well we're gonna be looking at another magnetic phone now today it's called the clever grip Pro and yep magnet power this is by Bell & Howell anyway we'll see what it looks like this is Jeff with Jeff reviews for you and my channel is dedicated to reviewing mostly as seen on TV items I look at some consumer gadgets other household items once in a while I do a little bit DIY just because I think it's a lot of fun if that interests you I would love it if you would subscribe to my channel and click that bell so you're notified every time I release the video just like this one now let's see what this clever grip pro really has to offer I'm gonna unbox this clever grip Pro I purchased it for $10 from my local acid on TV retailer let's see you open it from the bottom here alright so in the contents I have this part right here this actually hooks to a vent in your car it's got a little wedge like that you just stick it in there and it's spring-loaded and you're supposed to be able to hold it lower on your vent so your vent stays unobstructed alright so in here I have a magnetic piece that I'm guessing is gonna be hooked to the back your phone and then I've got some directions and I'll look at those off-camera so I'm anxious to check this out with sale strong this magnet is first let's see that's not that bad see if it'll hold my phone now okay I took the case off my phone and this is where I had my fastball phone mount here and so I'm gonna try this one actually on the phone and I did a little measurement test and I think right about here where the Apple is is where I want to put this now the directions do say to wash the spot you're gonna be put it on there either with an alcohol wipe or something to get the oils off and I've already done that and I'm just gonna sit here and push this in the center as best I can let's see them out there no I'm just gonna sit and hold it there for just a little while and hope it just sticks on there really really good so I'm holding it in place the directions don't really tell you how long but I'm just making sure it sticks they don't I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take it out to my car and see if it works so I held it on for about a minute and another that's it for a few hours so could fully cure and now I can hook up the clip and really check out to see if it works so you can see here it's gonna leave my air vent completely unobstructed and what I like is I can either use the phone up and down or if I wanted to I can actually turn the phone to a landscape mode and use it for navigation so let's go check it out to see if it works so do you have your favorite portable phone mount that you just can't live without is it the clever grip Pro from Bell & Howell or is it something else let me know down in the comment section below I would love to hear from you alright so here we are in the car you could see my fastball phone mount that I've been talking about now this thing is said to be able to be just hook in here and not block your vent so let's we put that in there let's see what happens well I noticed immediately that my vent dropped down and it won't hold up I guess it's just because the weight of the phone well that's interesting what I'm gonna do here though to test this out I'm gonna leave this out here in the car all night just to see if this magnet holds so it's been about 12 hours since I originally put the phone in the car on the Mount and I am hoping that it didn't fall were you know check it out in just a second and then we're gonna drive around town I'm gonna take it down the long drive I want to see if it shakes if it jostles exactly what it does also we're probably you'll take a look at some other vent Styles just because the first one I did I wasn't too impressed with so let's head on out to the car and cross your fingers hope the phone didn't fall so this was been in the car all night last night and it held up you know what it got cold last night so I had to come out and charge the phone if you remember for my recent videos I have the magnetic phone charger have done here and I will link that to you so you can see it I will say even though this is holding I've been driving for about 30 minutes or so I am real frustrated that it does not angle towards me watch this so I pull this up and if I let it go it falls right back down just because of the weight of the phone on the vent so what I'm going to end up doing is I'm going to end up trying it on a few other vents just to see if I have similar problems in different cars so the first car I checked on the vent I didn't really care for it because when you change the vent the phone weight would just bring it down no matter how you had this even though it doesn't block the vent so to say I also can't use it I'm if I want to point in a different direction and that's a little frustrating for me let's try it in a third vehicle so this is the third vehicle I'm trying this one has a different vent right so this is the kind of vent that you can spin and turn it opens like this so I can turn it like this and it doesn't go down anymore so if I wanted to hook this in sure enough so clip the phone right on no problem and I can even move it or do whatever I need to do with it there so if you have this kind of a vehicle or this kind of event this is a Ford that might be the best bet for you so the directions only talked about installation and earlier I told you how to clean it with an alcohol wipe and make sure you get all the oils off and then hold it down I held it down for about a minute but the directions don't tell you how to take off this metal piece if you wanted to so what I end up doing is I just took my nail here just did a real quick pry and I took it off it actually came off really really easy so therefore if I did not end up wanting to use this I am didn't have to now that being said if you take this piece off you're gonna wear down the 3m glue and you're probably going to render it useless I just want you to know that let's continue on with the review so we have been looking at the clever grip Pro Bell and Howells newest portable phone holder for your car the idea behind it is this goes into your vent and then there's a low-hanging magnet that you're able to mount to a metal disc that it comes with so your phone does not cover the vent and you're still able to access it it's a great concept I actually really like the idea because I'd use I used to use those clips that cover the vent and I noticed that the back of my phone will either get really hot or really cold depending on if was the air conditioning or heat and I unfortunately just was either hot or cold right so I couldn't feel the air and I couldn't feel the heat so I like this idea now practicality use of it little frustrating so you saw from the video that when I plug this in the weight of the foam fell down or made the vent fall down so sort of like facing down I would have liked it if it could have stayed up so I don't know if there's something else a different way they can do it and one of the vehicles I tried I was able to get it just because the way the vent was I just turned it around so it couldn't go down and that I guess would work I will say that I chose to mount this melt disc high on the phone because I wanted to sort of see it more right I guess you could have more mounted in the in the middle the disadvantage where I mounted it is that if I had the phone sideways I noticed that when it when I was bouncing whatever driving it started going like this right so you may want to Center it more in the middle in the end what I recommend a buy or deny for this it all depends on what you're looking for right this thing was only ten bucks pretty cheap so if you're looking for something quick and easy and like a really low profile this might be what you want remember the fastball this was supposed to been a low profile but it's pretty thick right this one is slim to none I actually can stick my case on back on and I don't even know it's there right so that's kind of cool so like I said it's all up to what you're looking for me I'm on the one side I will not be utilizing this I'm actually gonna be going back to the fastball I just liked it better for me it was more versatile anyway that was Jeff with Jeff reviews for you as always thanks for stopping by I hope you have a great day I am so glad you stuck around for my entire review of the Bell & Howell clabber grip Pro the newest as-seen-on-tv portable foam grip it works there's just a few things that I don't like about it that was just my review of it you know what though a year ago I referenced it earlier I did the review of the as-seen-on-tv fastball I'm gonna link that video right here if you hadn't seen it already oh that being said a few months ago I did a review of the magnetic phone charger and I'm gonna link that one on this side so take your pick they're both great videos I would love it if you would check them out go on click the link I promise it's safe", "62Lp5CnrKtQ": "hi everybody today we're going to take a look at the Ram mounts power plate three magnetic holder this is the AR AP - 300 - one this mount is typically going to be used to hold devices such as radar detectors electronic toll passes or even satellite radios the way that this works you have two rectangles here there's a larger black plastic rectangle on the outside a smaller red metal rectangle on the inside those are two separate pieces the red rectangle is inside of the black on the other side those two gold pieces you see there are actually magnets they're very strong magnets they're holding that small red metal plate in place now that red that you're seeing is actually just a layer on there that peels off and when we peel it off it's going to expose adhesive underneath so that plate will attach to whatever device you're mounting with the adhesive it'll attach to that plate and the plate is being held in place by the magnets on the bottom as well you have that circular shape that circular hole pattern there that is designed to accommodate this piece Ram - B - 2 0 - which is a round plate with a one-inch B sized ball this piece does not come with the power plate 3 mount this is purchased separately or as part of a bundle but what you can do is line up those two parts the round plate will bolt onto the power plate you'll have your device mounted on top and a one-inch ball on the bottom which you can then use to mount this to other Ram 1 inch B sized ball components so what we'll do now is we'll take a look at how to attach this round plate to the bottom of the power plate the first thing you're gonna do is just slide that red rectangle right off and when you do those magnets are gonna fall right out the bottom so just push that forward or off to the side and those will just whoops those will just come right off now you can put that red plate off to the side we're done with that for now so we'll separate the magnets and drop those back into the bottom of the power plate two sides to the magnets one has very straight edges kind of a dull color to it the other side a little bit more rounded more of a bright gold color and you want that bright gold color facing up toward you so drop the magnets in there and make sure be careful because they might jump out at you try to escape so just be careful when you're doing that drop those magnets in there one at a time and now you are going to take that round plate and line that up whoops line that up with the whole pattern on the bottom of the power plate so there's four holes on that plate well line up with the whole pattern on the round plate so get those all lined up now you're gonna take the hardware that came with this came with four nuts and four bolts so take one of the bolts drop that in from the flat side from the side of the flat plate and you can take one of the nuts now and get that started on to the other side just get that started by hand thread it on there a little bit and once you get that thread started you are going to need to take a wrench and a screwdriver you're gonna need the the wrench or something to hold the nut in place there so you can hold that on there take the screwdriver and get that tightened up the rest of the way good and tight so we have one on there now that's what that looks like with the first one done and we're going to pause here for a second and get the three remaining nuts and bolts attached to the power plate three so I've now finished mounting the round plate to the power plate three I have that one inch B sized ball now mounted on the bottom and I'm ready to complete the rest of my mount so now we're going to take the adhesive plate that I showed you earlier this small red rectangle again that red coating comes off there's adhesive underneath you have that black metal on the other side so you'll take whatever device you are mounting which today we have this deck of cards deck of cards because it's about the same size as many radar detectors or electronic toll passes so take whatever device you're mounting you want to make sure that the surface that the adhesive is going on is clean and dry the adhesive that you're put on there is pretty strong stuff and you really only get one shot at it so make sure clean and dry before you put it on the good news is that if you do happen to make a mistake if you need to try it again this plate that I am holding is sold separately so you can buy an extra one or two if you need it so there are actually three layers to this plate there's the red layer the outer layer a black layer on the bottom and a gray layer in the middle and the gray layer in the middle is actually going to stay with the metal part of the plate with the black part and you're gonna get your fingernail or your thumbnail in there and just peel off the red layer just pull that all the way off and that gray adhesive is gonna stay on there you can discard that red part so take the adhesive and you want to get that centered on whatever you're mounting and get it on there make sure that it is press down good and tight on there and that's about all you need to do you're now ready to use this with the rest of your power plate three we're now ready to use all of these parts together so here is our power plate base from before you have the round plate attached to the bottom and the two magnets underneath it we can take our deck of cards with the adhesive plate and just attach that right to the base and the magnets are gonna take over and hold everything in place here the plastic base does have some grooves in it so make sure when you put your device on there everything is centered and aligned to remove your device from the power plate base just grab hold of the sides you're going to twist and slide it off at the same time as I mentioned a moment ago you can purchase that adhesive plate separately which means you can keep the base mounted in one location like on your motorcycle or in a vehicle purchase a few of these plates and you can put them on different devices and just swap them in and out take one device off put another one on the last thing we are going to do here today is we're going to get a bar set up here and show this to you as part of a u-bolt mount so here I have my u-bolt base such as you would find on the handlebars of a motorcycle it has a one-inch B size all on it and onto that ball I can put an arm like this standard length B socket arm into the open socket I can put the one-inch ball from the bottom of the power plate mount and then I can adjust it as needed when I'm happy with it just tighten up the knob on the side of the arm and now I can take my deck of cards with that adhesive plate on the bottom drop that on to the power plate base make sure everything is centered in the grooves there and I'm all set to go so that is a quick look at the Ram mounts power plate three magnetic mount this is the AR AP - 300 - one", "q3KEeMaCL1A": "what's going on guys angel from discount vaping today we're gonna check out what we think is the best device for our cartridge we're going to dive down up and close we're going to give you a detailed look at all of them and I'm going to tell you what we think [Music] alright guys we're up close and personal now with mysticus we're gonna go over them we're gonna show you in depth what the features are on them and we're gonna pretty much show you why they're the best unit to have so this is a standard Mystica very very sleek design very small cartridge sits inside with these so basically you have a magnet on the bottom I'll show you this here this is your magnet this pretty much will screw on to any 510 cartridge so if you have your own it's not you're not limited to this cartridge and it does come with basically screw that on and now your cartridge is ready to go with some cartridges you're gonna have to adjust the magnet just to make some sometimes you will have to adjust the magnet that 510 pin won't be in the right spot which is not a big deal you just adjust and then you drop your cartridge in and it'll make it to connection just fine he have your button here this is your regular button just five clicks he'll turn it on five clicks will turn it off just like any other beep and then obviously you're gonna have to hold it down to inhale and when you're done you let go does have a USB charger the USB charger is included plugs in right here it's just a micro USB so if you lose it very easy to replace in the kit you'll get the device itself the empty cartridge and you'll get two magnets [Music] it is a concealed unit so most of the cartridge is inside of the unit itself you're not gonna have to worry about snapping the cartridge off like if it was on a pen that's the regular Mystica next on the list we have the Mystica menu very similar to the Mystica as you can see there's no button on this one so this is a vacuum activated or as they like to call it the auto battery all that means is when you go to inhale it will actuate the battery it'll start to fire and when you stop inhaling the battery or stop fire no on and off on this one which is nice because if you do put this in your pocket you're not gonna have to worry about hitting the button it's not gonna fire on its own you do have to actually inhale for this to fire this is another option charge port on the bottom same thing microUSB comes with the kit that's the mystic a minute the last Mystica which is the one we prefer at all of them is the mystic a variable voltage this is gonna be the best just because you're gonna be able to adjust with any cartridge you have looks like the regular Mystica you have your button up top your charge port here your USB charge port now doing different repetitions of the button for example five clicks to turn it off five bucks to turn it off you do two clicks it'll adjust the voltage you do another two it'll adjust it again the light inside will change colors to let you know what voltage wrong some cartridges require a hotter burn which is why you would want to adjust it some of them require less of a birth so with this you're gonna pretty much be able to use any cartridge the only thing that will limit you with any Mystica is gonna be the thickness of your cartridge most of the standard 510 cartridges will fit there is only a few maybe maybe four or three cartridges that we've ever seen that won't fit because of how thick they are but at most of the 510s they'll fit in here no problem this is a thicker one as you could see compared to this one it's a tad bit thicker and it fits in no problem it just sits in there so that's the only thing that'll limit you but with the variable voltage you're gonna be able to adjust like I said if you have you know cartridge that requires a little bit more you just click it set it a little bit higher and it'll work just fine that's our open/close of all the mysticus all right guys so we dug down we showed you what we think about dom\u00e9stica showing you all three options of them pretty much this is gonna be the best unit you can have it's concealed it's small you can adjust the wattage if you go with that option if you don't like that you get a regular option with a button works just fine if you don't want that you can get the auto battery you just have to pull on it very simple to use and the Chargers is also probably our favorite part because you micro USBs are everywhere you can find them anywhere if you like what you saw in the video check us out at discount VF end comm give us the thumbs up hit the subscribe button [Music]

to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our

guys this is gonna be our first look at the Uni by yocan this is a really cool box it's got some really cool ideas it's pretty much gonna be catered to using whatever kind of cartridge you happen to come upon or you prefer use them so at first glance we'll just look around at the packaging it shows you some of the cool features about it but when you really look at it in person and see them being used as where it ends up getting really cool so you just some of the little features along the side packaging it's nice we open her up what we get right here is gonna be the device your magnet which will sink down into the hole and that there's a whole bunch to say about that so I'll get into that later I'm gonna force your charge cable which is a microUSB pretty standard and then a little instruction manual on the back so the first thing the unit itself just to give you a quick 360 of it it's very lightweight um I think they do use some kind of metal to make it but it's a really light metal that's one thing you'll notice right away when you hold this thing is it really doesn't have any weight to it even though it might be a little bit bigger size it's not gonna weigh your pockets down too much so it's an easy all-day carry ruc nice and grieving with their logo right there this is gonna be a battery indicator for the voltage so it'll show you what setting you're at right here is a cool little adjuster so what this will do is actually raise or lower the the cartridge on the inside so depending on if you have a full milliliter or a half milliliter no matter what it's gonna work well because you can pump this up or down pretty cool idea and then the main feature here is gonna be this little knob which will rotate and that will spin out teeth that will grip onto your cartridge it's really cool once you see it used in person so here and then of course you have your charge port on the side it's gonna be micro USB so for example now this is not the magnet that comes with it this is just a cartridge that we have but it'll the concept is gonna be exactly the same so what you do is you just drop this in here sink right down and then what you could do is you could lower or raise how high that sits so depending on what size that is you could get it to the perfect level where you want to hit it from where you're come drawing on the cartridge from and then the other feature of course is going to be that you have these teeth here that you can rotate let me just show you how that works without a cartridge where you could come in and you could totally adjust for exactly what it is and I'd set it in the place so that it'll grip into it really good well that is really cool I mean that's pretty innovative we haven't really seen anything like that unique idea by yocan so you see there's some wiggle here but all you have to do is just come in and lock that in and then that removes almost all the wiggle really cool really cool right there any other cool things about it is it's got a big battery life so it's 650 milliamps that is way bigger than most of the batteries that are gonna be in class with this so comparatively it will have a great battery life um like I said before you have your standard adjustable voltage so this is gonna go through three different presets depending on how you pick it you do that by click on the button I believe three times will change the voltage up here and overall just a really solid boxing it's a really cool concept it works well and we have not seen really any issues with it it works exactly like advertised so I mean no much more to say a lot of these boxes are simple but it's gonna get the job done it's gonna do it well and the cool part is no matter what cartridge you throw at it 9 out of 10 times I'd say even almost 10 out of 10 times it's gonna it's gonna work well with it and they'll fit everything so it's about gonna wrap it up that's our first look at the yocan uni box alright guys those are first look at the Yukio can mooney really really cool features with this one this is probably one of the more innovative ones we've seen just to highlight like we said you have the first adjuster which will adjust the size how far the tank protrudes and then you also have your little knob over here that you could twist to come to bring the teeth in or out and really fit into your tank you got three adjustable voltage settings just take a little sample hip for you guys you can get an idea but it'll be like again each cartridge is a little different so take that in mind but awesome so if you liked

both look really similar and the way they pull and just everything about them is pretty similar but I like this he's so calm way more than the beep so first I'll show you the remod and how it works so if you want to turn it on you click 5 times and the yellow is a medium temperature you click 3 times we take change the temperature the first thing that's bad about the v-mon for me is that it started twitching out on day 2 it stopped working basically and everything on to go to preheat it which is - it's supposed to go in to that that's preheating that's normal but every time I'll do that it would just start flashing different colors it does when it works I'm like what is this I tried searching around the V mod all that and basically there wasn't much about it I did one video on YouTube explaining how to use it but there's nothing to help you if it breaks nothing so I had to figure I got it to work again at first I was hitting it like I was like you know what maybe if I drop it it will work and it actually did I dropped it in the night I went to go preheat it and it wasn't passionate cause it was just being normal so I'm like oh my gosh so that's so janky that I have to drop it or hit it for it to work so I'll doing that for a while then I realize that it's it's like the heating thing I don't know the technical name so sorry if you're watching this you know the technical name but I don't know the name but that thing he down there is something to do with that so instead of dropping it so like that was just moving around this thing because the problem is something with that if you got a vimana it broke try wiggling I'm a cart around in there and just like put in different positions I tried twisting it wiggling on a different position on the little heating battery part of it whatever I mean the whole thing is called a battery but I think you guys know what I mean so I'm gonna show how it hit then - its preheating what a prison I would say it so if your oil is like filled a lot you really don't need to preheat much but if it the lower it gets I think the the longer I like to preheat it the max the Max's said was 15 seconds but that's honestly a one time he preheating I thought you're wasting your oil at that point so I'm gonna preheat oh you guys see it's doing it look at that that's exactly what I mean thank goodness that it happens I could show you honestly that and then even when I tried it just not pretty and just hit it James so if I keep trying to hit it while are you doing that all of a sudden it just starts burning like my oil just started burning smoke starts coming up it's that not super janky guys like so [ __ ] days is pretty I like to do you can just tell like when you're comparing the seesaw palm in the demob like this just feels heavier this feels like more expensive materials feels like I'm gonna hold in a little phone or something this is very much made out of like metal material but this feels very very light for some reason I mean it's just Jane so I'm gonna try wiggling around see if that helps I'm gonna turn it off wiggle it around turn it back on let's see no I'm gonna cut the camera and just keep trying to hit it and wiggle it and come back and hopefully it works so I could show you guys how it hit because I do want to show the comparison between hubby's alright I successfully got it preheating so much so how it is to stop preheating you just press it and start hitting it so yeah the vimana the good thing about the vimana is it gives off a lot of smoke it seemed really smack like you will get lit quick I spent like it's in it's a nice battery for that like you get five hits you get a lit but it's so [ __ ] Genki like you could just get another brand just like the seesaw palm like it's like the same thing but better [Music] so really a good amount of smoke and it's just an Android charger so that's good and I really like to see so palm because the packaging came for a little tutorial the warranty this comes with a warranty up to all up to 180 days that is a long time something could happen to this so we got you movie I have to watch it cause II didn't mention about the vimana it's the same thing on the seesaw on the v-mon it comes with this little connector open it comes off like that and you need that because it's magnetic and it sticks it to the heating thing but the seesaw is it comes with two in case you lose it like comes with the extra in the package because you probably wounds are those mean this only comes with one it also doesn't come with a user manual to tell you like you need to screw that thing on and that's how you hit it all that some people probably already lost it no it's fully charged if you plug it in and then in blinks a bunch of times like 20 times and then it just turns off if it's not blinking the more it's fully charged the battery should last you three days to be charged it will just keep blinking and then when it goes off it's ready and then you can just just play is a different pool from the V mug because the v mod you preheat then hit so they're preheating already I was like smoke coming up so it's way easier to get it fat and this is like a harsh put like you really got to use one power because it is and I hope this gives off watch more because there's not a lot of oil in yet I mean it will be giving off more smoke if this car was more cool thing about the C sub palm in the V mod is that when your carts on its last hits you're still gonna get smoked when you're using a little white to battery usually when it's on the last hits you can't get any more like it just stops at some point sheesh okay this is honestly good clouds when you might have oil in there this is wedding cake and here is some forbidden fruit red fruit is far the tree version another card just then make cookies when I have this in my pocket or something it kind of unscrews from the theme gets loose be careful because I start to like try to hit it and I'm like why isn't making me smoke it is really just starting to get loose good in my pocket I love how it just hides my palms away I'm over here trying to get a fight here for the video and really buddy kill myself they won the most so I'm done I'm putting the car wait period that's enough that's enough of that and conclusion if you're looking for a better really wouldn't recommend he's good like there's this and I noticed there's a seesaw silo which I think if I did for which button my reason I'm still even using it it's cuz this car is kind of leaky so I don't care and I'm putting it in the video thank you guys for watching I hope this helped you if you're thinking about getting a battery I recommend getting into it you don't have", "QrNHcw5a0IE": "say Limina youtube channel it up til

cartridges comes in four colors you have the black on silver the black on black be red on silver and be blue on silver well let's open this up and have a look at it and show you how to use it so it does come with an instruction manual which is nice sometimes they weren't including instruction manuals on their earlier models but shows you how to use it some tips and tricks and disclaimers of course you have the microUSB to USB charging cable you have the magnetic 510 adapter and you have the device itself now what's nice about this box mod is that it is designed to be able to use a vast variety of different prefilled cartridges it has the adjustable width which goes from six millimeters all the way open to 12 millimeters you have a height adjustment from the lowest to middle to high depending on the height of your prefilled cartridge and it does have a window to show you the level of your cartridge let's attach prefilled cartridge here all you do is just screw it on it is a 510 threaded even though it does look like it is closing off some of the holes there is a gap in between them this allows the air flow to come in since a lot of these prefilled cartridges have the air holes at the base or even on the threads so this way it isn't restricting any air flow I would get started I like to raise this all the way up to the top make sure this is completely open and all you're going to do is drop it in and you'll hear the nice magnetic connection so this is on the highest setting middle well we're gonna use this one on low and then we're going to close the width off so it doesn't rattle around and or fall out to power on the device you press it five times rapidly so one two three four five the device flash is letting you know it's on it does have three different voltage settings so you have the lowest with one light and to change that you press it three times rapidly so one two three I'd be a little quicker and then you have two lights for middle and then two two three and then you have three lights for the highest setting and when you press this the light does shine letting you know the level of your cartridge this also does have a ten-second preheat so you can press the button two times and it will run for 10 seconds so you don't have to hold down the button so to do that all you do is press the button two times one two and lights showing letting you know that it's going and you can hear it gurgling there and then it will flash right now letting you know that the cycle is over but you can also just hold down this this should have an 18 second shutoff so let's see here and this should be turning off right about now maybe there we go and so it does have the 18 second automated shutoff so in case it's in your pocket it's just not going constantly and then to power off the device all you do is press the fire button five times so one two three four five and the device will flash letting you know that it's powered off and when you press it nothing happens this stuff's have a 650 million power battery and it does feel pretty light in the hands I like how compact it is as you can see in my hand here and it's not real heavy so when you have it in your pocket or something like that it doesn't feel like you have this massive object in your pocket and that it does have the adjustable settings for your prefilled cards just remember when you change your cartridge make sure you unscrew this base and don't toss this away or you will not be able to use this device because there's no thread and threads in here it's just the magnetic connection but check us out at be 2-squared calm coupon code in the description and have a great day", "zxdypX1F1JM": "all right so i finally have something worth demonstrating a little bit here so we've got the top piece hazel has the little magnet configurations and the bottom piece which houses big magnet configurations and of course some holes that need to be filled up because these will eventually the little magnets will eventually be exposed inside those holes and so we don't want debris and whatnot getting in there okay so there are some slots on the lower uh part for these to make their entry in to the system and so it looks kind of like that when they they all join then it's actually kind of hard to to start turning it so that the thickness of this will have to decrease a little bit and also there's some friction there's enough it's so tight that there's it's hard to turn even if there were like magnets inside of it and then uh here when you're in one of the standard

hand then and and the do and and", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments

the magnets you can see how fast this updates so the measurement just takes less than one second", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want

all right so let's get into it now with something like the print stick here this is gonna have a microUSB port on the back this is gonna be ideal and actually the only way that you can charge this guy now a couple things you want to be weary of is the type of charger you're using meaning the wire the wires not going to matter as much but what you plug that wire into will so you want to make sure that you actually have a lower amperage charger a lot of times people try to use their smart phone chargers or something of this sort usually not gonna be your best bet you won't always take it flip it upside down and look at what the rating is on it you always want a slower amperage believe it or not it's a little easier on the battery it won't charge it quite as quick but it will cause a lot less problems um with built-in batteries like that you could have a lot of issues with fast charging and over shock not so much over charging with charging it too quick it'll also decrease the lifespan of your cells so with these guys use a low amperage micro USB brick and usually any wire is gonna be fine we recommend you do a PC because the PC you're pretty safe with that and it's not gonna charge it to too quickly now some with something like the booboo drag here this guy runs off to removable cells which are 18 650 batteries two of them this does have the option for charging through the port but we don't recommend it and the reason for that is because you have to have a balanced charge which means when you plug this in the device is now responsible for making sure both batteries stay even and a lot of devices try to have the technology for that but don't do the best job on it and it's only gonna cause stress to your boxes chip and the batteries themselves if it doesn't work out right so with something like this guy the drag we recommend you use a removable charger of some kind this is only one of the few that we have in one of the many that we carry you have plenty of options if you need more than two batteries you could uh two Bay's you could definitely do that it goes about six some are even eight now what you're gonna do is just pull your batteries out and pop them on your charger and you even set yourself up for a great situation where you could have extra batteries sitting on the charger so when the two on here died you could just add two more in and you know if the week an ideally if you're using your device all day that's probably gonna be your preferred method of doing it and it's gonna you know let your device have a much more even charge throughout the whole process now if you like any of the products you see here whether it be the print stick the boo boo drag or the k2 slim charger from efest or any other charger you may need for different sizes we have them all available for purchase at discount benton and if you liked the video thought it was informal just give us a like or subscribe we'll see you next time [Music] [Applause] you", "J6S44lgmNu0": "we're checking out one of our Lowe's latest products the arlo wired video doorbell what is going on everyone it is Andrew here from Apple Insider ARLA when the past has had a smart doorbell but it really just did audio here we're looking at their new video doorbell now to get started it is a wired doorbell so if you're looking for a Wire free solution you're out of luck and you're gonna have to look elsewhere after picking it up you can run this thing for free or you can get a bunch of really cool additional features by subscribing to our low smart we'll talk about that in just a few as far as the basics go this is another wired video doorbell it's got motion detection and alerts video calls quick reply messages for when something comes in you're too busy to kind of answer it night vision it is of course weather resistant because it's supposed to go outside it is tamper resistant so if it does get tampered with you're gonna get an alert that someone tried to mess with doorbell as well just so you have an idea of what's going on inside of the box is everything you need to get started I really don't need anything too fancy to get this thing installed it is very easy took us just a few moments and will replace a standard doorbell or if you're coming from something else like a ring and you're tired of all the privacy issues and everything else that comes with owning a ring doorbell so you have the doorbell itself you have an angle bracket there you have the mounting hardware you have the tool to remove the plate to gain access to the back part just to kind of separate things out the chime adapter and again the mounting hardware all the screws you need and the wiring nuts just everything you need to get the going it's very simple very easy to go nothing is really fancy here you don't have to use all the parts so right here is like the angled mount so if you don't need to mount this at an angle then you don't have to use you can mount it straight on the door it's very wide so it works it very well you have a chime adapter now honestly I didn't use this we don't have an old chime in the house so I just did not use this but if you do have a chime going to your existing doorbell it's very easy to attach that and get going so here's a doorbell it's pretty much what it looks like there's just the two spots in the back to connect the wires coming from your existing doorbell along front you have the camera up towards the top you have a button down there at the bottom where someone can actually your doorbell as they approach it and you have a status light there in the center but otherwise it's just a very small unassuming video doorbell we got ours installed and women and running for the past few weeks we've been trying out our low smart with a video doorbell which honestly I'm not usually a huge fan of those but our logo adds so many different features Darla smart that I thought it was really worth it with this doorbell oh and we also have a bunch of other cameras as well so it kind of just ties into the whole package so here it is Matt's on our front porch as someone approaches the door you can see this will light up here giving of that breathing kind of status light there on the front it also gives them a good visual notifier of where they can press as a motion detector you'll get a rich notification especially on the Arlo smart subscription which is how you get these you'll see this was a person detected it'll highlight the motion in that video on that rich alert and you can immediately go ahead and tap on play and you what is happening on your doorbell so if you want to view a live view this is what we're looking at here alive you right from that notification then if someone should press the button on the doorbell you're gonna get a call now you're not just gonna get an alert you're actually gonna get like a phone call this is tying in to Apple's phone kit API where it actually allows it to show up as a phone it'll show in your call log inside of the phone app and you can answer this and accept it just like any other call a lot of times you don't need to see the video you already saw that motion alerts you know who it is you just need to talk them you don't have to use the video things this is much more unassuming and easier to manage of course you can just jump into the Arlo app get into a live stream have a call there you can see in that lower left-hand corner where the quick replies are where you can send back a recorded message I'll letting them know like just leave the package where it is or whatever it may be now I'm not gonna be Lee are you with all the settings out of the Arlo app but there's a lot of stuff to tie into you can view Wi-Fi networks time zones flicker addressing this doorbell LEDs change the time that you're using you can go in there and these are a couple the important ones that you may want to tinker with it for everything is not that perfect out of the box which for us it was but you can adjust that brightness higher lower you can change the resolution all these come on square resolution which is kind of a huge thing but you can actually see things on your ports like packages usually a much more vertical real estate now using our low smart you can add activity zone so maybe you don't want to get the road in this shop but I do want to take the motion everywhere else that is definitely something you can do with those activity zone very handy to not just get plagued by a pile of notifications when you tie into the library you can see all the recordings that have come in everything gets flagged by what it is which is part of that are low smart subscription so it'll know if it's a person if it's an animal if it is just standard motion or if a package has been delivered it's really cool to kind of see how it all plays out tying into a video you can download it whatever you need to do start it favourite it all of that jazz we've been talking a lot about Arlo smart and what it does so the main things are it'll enable 30 day video history up in the cloud for other cameras it only enable higher resolution cloud recording you have those intelligent and real rich alerts advanced object detection including package detection and cloud activity zones another Arlo smart feature is a 9-1-1 when you call that one one from your phone it's just going to route you to where your phone is located but with a 9-1-1 it'll route to where your house is located so it's out to town for a trade show I see something screwing going on with my Arlo and I think I need to call the cops I can call using the ena and one one feature and it's going to ring back where my house is so I can get routed as quickly as possible to the appropriate authorities the Arlo video doorbell is pretty fantastic I love the more vertical real estate you get on video the video is crisp in high resolution the smart features coming with Arlo smart are absolutely amazing and different than a lot of the ones that we've seen my biggest grapes is that there's no a Wire free version running on battery and that there's no homekit support our low has been good about adding home get support in the past so I'm hopeful that maybe down the line we will see home kit support come to the Arlo video doorbell but for now we're just gonna have to be happy with what we've got if you want to grab an Arlo video doorbell for yourself you can find the link down below in the description and I want to hear what you guys think reach out to me on Twitter at Andrew underscore OSU hey everyone did you guys like that video be sure to click on that like button so we can create content that we know that you guys want to see and

"lOLWsC7NZ9M": "[Music] [Music] that right there is a leaking engine oil cooler on this Nissan Rogue we're gonna fix that line change those seals out and stop it from leaking so continue to watch the video and let's get to it all right there is four twelve millimeter bolts holding the oil cooler to the block to the engine block and you may want to break them loose with the ratchet first because my electric ratchet didn't have enough power to breaking loose and my little impact my boss impact didn't have enough power so broken loose by hand and then I pulled them out with the Electric ratchet just ran a lot real quick and yeah that's what we got here let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right right here at this point I want to warn you about that water pressure sending unit oil pressure sensor don't break it you can break it I have broken one in the past I've only broken one but it is possible so you should remove it it's a 24 millimeter socket deep I'm pretty sure exercise so you should take that sensor out don't break it you've been warned it's up to you to not break the sensor okay get it good bye [Applause] [Music] there is a total of four ten millimeter bolts on the top of that warrior housing tool you can see right there in the picture and there's two more on the opposite side that you can't really see in the picture so make sure you take all four those BOTS out before you start trying to pry that one cooler housing apart [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so once you have your oil cooler taken apart and you discover in the orange oil seal like you see pictured in the video you can pretty much be guaranteed that that oil cooler seal is original to the vehicle and it's never been changed typically these oil seals felt like around 60 70 thousand mile oil start leaking you'll see the oil residue like you saw at the beginning of the video around the oil cooler so change the sill but the new updated cell in there the updated cell is black and um they don't really lead to much afterwards I've never had to redo that silicon so change this Hill out and your problems will be solved now this still leaks on the Altimas Rose any time with the 2.5 liter which I think it's only the ultimate in the roll with that style oil cooler so if you see that style oil cooler on your vehicle and it's a nice Sun it's a 2.5 liter and it's leaking just change the seals on there and that will resolve your oil leaking issues [Music] all right so the torque spec for these bolts are not super critical you can talk to them from anywhere from sixty one seventy to eighty inch pounds which would be about five to seven foot-pounds of torque if you don't have a foot pound torque wrench then you can use inch pounds or vice versa but the spec it's not super clearquest you can see me in the video I'm using a ratchet to tighten them down I've never had any issues with that but if you're OCD I will go with 70 to 90 inch pounds or six to eight foot pounds of torque for those top bolts the four ten millimeters at the top [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "dZ-gmWrCBOA": "colgate total grade

any debris damages on the shafts and key will prevent the proper mounting of the coupling make certain that all surfaces and edges are smooth and properly prepared for the assembly kote the shaft surfaces with molybdenum sulfide assembly paste which has applied for most assembly processes this material aids in preventing fretting corrosion and makes a disassembly of the coupling much easier in addition to the shaft make sure the coupling bores keyways and edges are clean and free of any damages finished board couplings are provided with the appropriate size set screws already installed you will need to back the set screw out far enough so that it does not extend into the couplings keyway and interfere with the key or shaft during the assembly it is also possible to completely remove the set screw if you remove it make sure to place the set screw in a safe place that is easily accessible for when you need to replace it it is generally recommended that the nu pecs coupling should be supplied with a transitional or interference fit depending on the application heating the hubs will expand the bore size which will facilitate the assembly use a heater or oven intended for this purpose and check the operating instructions to determine the proper temperature the hub should reach before you attempt to assemble it on the shaft while wearing the appropriate safety equipment carefully position the heated hub on the shaft slide it into place making sure the final resting position has the end of the shaft flush with the surface of the hub the standard flexible elements are made of per bunin and therefore sensitive to heat if the hub will be heated beyond 100 degrees centigrade or 212 degrees Fahrenheit make sure the elements are removed from the hub before it is heated please note that other flexible elements have different temperature limits the second hub should be heated like the previous one depending on the fit the heating temperature can be different using the proper safety equipment again position the heated hub on the shaft slide into place once more making sure the final resting position has the end of the shaft flush with the surface of the hub if the set screws were removed reinsert and tighten them by hand an appropriate torque wrench should be used to tighten the set screws to the recommended torque you can find a list of the recommended settings in the operating manual after the coupling cools down enough it is time to insert the flexible elements always use new flexible elements when putting a coupling into service never combine old with new flexible elements this is necessary to ensure an even load distribution and therefore a long lifetime also note the elements are molded to match the curve of the coupling therefore be sure to insert the elements the right way round move one of the machines needing to be connected towards the other the cams have to be aligned to fit between the flexible elements nu pecs couplings are designed to be aligned easily simply place a straight edge across both hubs and to make any corrections to align the connected equipment the straight edge has to be in full contact across both hubs repeat this process at several positions around the coupling diameter this will ensure a proper angular and radial alignment the axial alignment can be easily verified using a feeler gauge refer to the operating instructions for correct clearance check this dimension using the gauge at several positions around the diameter of the coupling we suggest aligning the drive to reach the average s dimension tighten the screws on the connected units to their specifications your coupling is now properly aligned and ready for operation the application of the wear indicator will give you an invaluable maintenance advantage to check for flexible element wear while the coupling is still in operation it is no longer required to stop the operation of your equipment apply the wear sticker according to the instructions then while the drive is still in operation you'll be able to use a strobe light to actually see how much the elements of warn and to know when to replace them this video demonstrates how to replace the flexible elements for a Siemens nu pecs coupling type a the same process applies regardless of the coupling size while manually twisting the drive shaft with respect to the driven shaft the wear indicator will show the state of wear of the flexible elements you will be able to gain easy access to the flexible elements by removing the bolts and pulling back part three the ring the main advantage of the wear indicator is to detect the wear status of the flexible elements while the drive is still in operation use a strobe light to clearly show the status this will enable you to plan an exchange of the elements and prevent unexpected downtime loosen and remove the bolts between the hub part two and the ring part three a suitable lever tool should be used to separate the two coupling parts once they've come apart use your hands to completely pull back the ring out of the way turn the hub in order to locate the elements in the area between the raised section of the hub where the bolts are inserted then using a screwdriver for example remove the flexible elements one at a time after all flexible elements have been exchanged and the coupling hub has been cleaned of any rubber residue it is time to insert the new flexible elements please note that the elements are molded to match the curve of the coupling therefore be sure to properly align the flexible elements as you insert them one after the other into the coupling hub always use a new set of flexible elements for the coupling never combine old with new flexible elements this is necessary to ensure an even load distribution and therefore a longer service life after replacing the last element you are ready to reassemble the coupling use the wear indicator to position the two halves the arrow should be pointing in the original position begin to insert the fingers of the ring between the flexible elements it will be necessary to apply even pressure across the surface of the ring this will ensure the fingers slide evenly into the gap and completely around the entire diameter of the coupling replace the bolts and fasten them finger tight an appropriate torque wrench should be used to tighten the bolts to the recommended torque the recommended tightening stalks are listed in the operating instructions do not use lubricants on the threaded surfaces as it will affect the friction values make sure the coupling halves are secure if the drive components have not been moved during the process it is not necessary to realign the coupling this video is for demonstration purposes only refer to the official Siemens operating manual for proper handling instructions", "OqEOVgeJD8k": "what is up guys a review of the Adaro you grip that magnetic Universal car mount so this is gonna hold any kind of smartphone because it hasn't been a grip you want to worry about any kind of cases so taking a look at what we have in front of us this is the car mount itself so this is going to go in the air vent and then you're gonna have a sticky magnetic that's gonna clip on so you have a warranty card if two metal plates this is going to separate the magnet from your phone and then we have two magnets with adhesive backing so now we're gonna take a quick look at the box on the back you can see we have multiple ways of mounting the metal plates so now to show you how I set up to you grip what I do is I take this magnet strip I put my phone in my case and I take the he civ magnetic I stick it onto my case and then from there you can see that it'll stick so now we're gonna go me this to test in the car so now I touched it you grip onto the event and as you can see it has a good grip so I want to worry about it falling off so now I'm just going to attach my phone so write that yourself that you grew up in action I was very impressed with this car mount I like how it's magnetic and you have to worry about putting it in a case make it stand up this is great - just goes right on you could pull it right off at any time so that's what the pros and cons this is a great car mount for anyone who's looking for something that's cheap it's very affordable at ten dollars now if anyone is a little nervous about putting their phone near magnetic there is a little covering that's gonna protect it from the magnets you want to worry about that in finding conses car mount so if

might be more\nsecure right now into your problem and this national broadcasting", "ZZDLC377hHM": "hi I'm grant today we're going to give you a video update on what to look for in the automatic transmissions of the Subaru range of models and above me here is the o8 Subaru Forester XT which comes out with the turbocharged single scroll 2.5 liter engine which was later replaced in 2013 with the twin scroll two litre direct injection engine which happen turbo sitting down underneath it what I wanted to show you is some of the hidden traps of not correctly servicing your car or overlooking some of the things that we tend to sort of gloss over when we're looking after a car but maybe over a hundred thousand codes in this particular car here is that a reasonably good service history the client bought it as a secondhand car for his wife is another Subaru himself and it came in with a few squeaks and rattles for us that will look out we noticed that it had a bent sump and on pulling the sump off within found it had some more damage internally which was only evident by pulling the sump off now what I want to show you if the super Ranger models classically come out with a 4-speed or a 5-speed transmission in this particular model here is the 4-speed automatic transmission but you'll notice it doesn't have a filter on the side some of the two auto transmissions from Subaru either have a filter on the side which can be externally changed or a remote filter which actually sits up inside the inner guard which doesn't exist in this particular model but it may be like the later five five speed transmissions that come out in the other range of Subaru foresters and say for example the Liberty GT but in this particular car because it doesn't have an external filter you would hope and assume that there is an internal filter inside which there is and this particular part here is the internal filter that you can see which is replaceable internally in here is the part that cleans the transmission oil but runs up all through the transmission when it's running because remember it is an automatic transmission with a separate front differential and the transfer case that goes out the back and these are all the solenoids up here that control the way the transmission operates and moves the hydraulic fluid around inside the transmission to allow it to change gears but what I really wanted to show you is actually what's down here below look at my cameraman they go really close and this part here is actually a magnet and it's very hard to remove but you'll see all of that there is actually furry pizza pieces of ferrous particle and mechanical parts out of the transmission that has migrated to this magnet in the sump which if you can't see it but I can feel is quite lumpy in some places and they're little chips and bits and pieces off the gears and stuff now this is the drain here for the oil when you do an oil change on the transmission but on the far side is where this magnet sits and you will never realize what is in certainly in the Sun now this part here you can also see it's had a big bit of a wallet at some stage and bent this up and so this part here has been deflected up which then closes off the entry side to the pickup which is here so effectively the sump is sitting close up inside here and of course we were concerned that this might be restricting the oil supply to the transmission but it's just as well that we pulled the sump pan off because we're then able to see what the condition of the gearbox is clean this sump up correctly from an internal point of view and also make sure that this magnet has had all the mark all the particles removed off it so for future use we can check it again maybe in six months time and see if there's any more damage coming out of the transmission the transmission works okay but it is something that you need to be aware of that may not always be visually obvious when you're looking after your car so of course the rest of the car is in really good condition we've now check this out interestingly we actually had to pull the whole transmission off the back of the engine because it had a a rear main crankshaft seal leak and there was oil dripping down behind the back of the sump originally looked like it was a leaking sump it actually turned out to be a leak at the back of the cran shop so the owner of this car is probably going to get at least another good five years out of it for a reliable service history point of view so there you have a little bit more information on how to look after your subaru forrester automatic transmission remember check the oil regularly if you get an opportunity a lot of modern-day cars have hidden magnets inside the sums that you may not be aware of and of course if you've got any questions and you want to ask them contact us via facebook youtube twitter or instagram check out our new website and do a search in the keyword search at the

Dobsonian telescopes now you might think well what's the counterweight doing on a Dobsonian telescope usually that's the equatorial amounts that have a counterweight well this is a really handy accessory for Dobsonian that don't have any other like tensioning system or let's say you're putting something really heavy on it that's gonna even override the tensioning system that's already on there it's a magnetic base it's designed to attach to the back end of the telescope and balance whatever you're gonna be putting on the top okay so let me show you how it works the magnet is underneath these foam strips so it's not gonna scratch the surface of your tube it just places it down onto the side there you let go and you're you're in business so let's say you've got something heavy up top you can slide this thing up or down to balance whatever load is going to be there and if you slide it up and down you're not gonna scratch the surface because it's got the foam rails plus those foam rails act as a little leveling device so it doesn't rock this way around the radius of the tube it's one pound one ounce so that means when you put it down here it's probably counter balancing more than one pound worth of equipment on top or if you slide it up closer to the bearings its balancing a little less and the nice thing about this is you can always add another one so let's say you needed a you needed two pounds two ounces you can add another one here side by side or you can add them in line as many as you need to balance whatever heavy equipment you're putting up on top so a very elegant simple solution for balancing heavy loads on a Dobsonian telescope thank you very much clear skies you", "tVJe-4hJqVA": "hello everybody this is nyc media mix bringing you a review of the newer ring 48 macro led light this unit was purchased via amazon for about 33 dollars and i was very curious to see what kind of results i'd get out of it so we're going to do a brief unboxing and actually try to get some sample images taken with this product to let you know whether it's a good buy and worth the 33 dollars or if it's better to just pass on this see what we have inside we have an instruction manual we have the ring light unit itself it feels okay for a plastic piece of gear i would probably want to keep it in the original packaging because i wouldn't want this cable to get a loose connection over time let's put that aside ah this appears to be the input output adapter that goes on the shoe mount of your slr here we have an ac adapter that's included with this led light and finally we have a bunch of adapters that you will use with different lenses to work with this macro light we have it's about six filters ranging from 49 millimeter all the way up to 67 millimeter they feel cold i think they're metal actually here we have my canon 60d and the led macro light i've attached the 60 millimeter macro lens onto my eos 60d and that has a 52 millimeter filter thread so i'm going to take this adapter take off my lens cap and this adapter simply screws on to the camera body right onto the filter thread you just screw it in and installation of the light is as simple as sliding on the back of the light there's this area where you slide the filters in and i am going to simply slide in the filter it's a little i'm going to give it a little pressure there we go goes right in as you can see and the battery pack which by the way holds two double a batteries i'm using rechargeable batteries because i can imagine this thing each two batteries i stick the battery pack on the hot shoe there's no power going through there it's merely just to hold the battery pack in place and now i can power up and you see that's pretty bright

"ExF06a0z-KQ": "a chili from Best Buy Canada's blog and welcome to my review of the Arlo video doorbell I've been using Arlo smart cameras since 2015 and I'm pretty sure that I have almost every single Arlo product available right now so I was very excited to install and test out the Arlo video doorbell install process is quite easy and all you have to do is download the Arlo app and there are steps in the app and it'll walk you right through it and there's even videos if you get stuck on something so you'll start your install by removing the cover of your doorbell chime depending on the configuration of your transformer you will either you will follow the steps in the app to wire the power kit to your doorbell we'll stick the power kit to the side of your doorbell cover back on and then you move outside here I had already removed my previous video doorbell so I was about to install the Arlo video doorbell my breaker was definitely off at this point obviously and all you have to do is connect the doorbell to the wires but first you need to choose your baseplate there's a flat base plate and then there is a tilted Bates plate I chose the tilted base plate in retrospect I probably would just install the flat base plate because when I tilted although it does take in a better view of my yard what it does also though is catch of you of the corner of my screen door once you connect the wires to the back of the Arlo video doorbell you just push it on to the base plate there is a small little screw that you would connect there's an allen key so you there's just a small little screw and once that's all connected then it's time to turn your power back on and open the app the built-in HD camera of the Arlo video doorbell you get a max 15 36 P resolution motion detection is available with this doorbell and that LED will light up when it does detect motion when somebody presses that button that the LED circles you can answer the call one of the things that I really like about the Arlo video doorbell is as opposed to other video doorbells is how you can call the doorbell or somebody can call you and it actually rings through like a real call it doesn't automatically open up in your app it actually just starts to ring on your phone once you answer it it then directs you to the app use the two-way audio to interact with whoever's at your door or you can just leave a pre-recorded message or use a pre-recorded message there's a few to choose from so with the two-way audio and the pre-recorded messages sound like all our low cameras you can view a live stream of your video doorbell it exists right within the Arlo app just like all of your other cameras the main differences though between the Arlo video doorbell and other Arlo smart cameras is that it doesn't require the Smart Hub so this doorbell will be able to be armed and disarmed on its own schedule it doesn't have to follow the schedule that the Arlo smart hub does and if you don't already have Arlo cameras that means that all of the Arlo cameras are either armed and disarmed at the same time they're not individual here's a look at some of the video clips that I've captured with the Arlo video doorbell I have it set to max resolution as you can see my screen door does interfere because of that tilted plate so I will definitely be changing that out but I find that the video is very clear the audio is also very clear it's a great resolution overall and there is no lag or delay if you have a strong internet connection near your doorbell what I really love about Arlo cameras and what the Arlo video doorbell will also do is tell you what the thing it is that it has detected so in this case it would be it our load had detected a person on the doorstep but it also will detect vehicles and animals and I find that those personalized notifications really help when you're considering whether or not you've got to pop open the app and see who's there it was using the doorbell in very chilly conditions on the day that this was taken the weather had dropped to about minus 15 at this point at that temperature it was having a bit of a struggle even with a solid four bars of Wi-Fi connection it was still struggling to connect to the to my phone so that was the only downside that I found is as the temperatures continue to drop and they hit about minus 2022 that night with the wind it's the doorbell didn't function but that is the upper limit of Arlo's weatherproof ability I find even my other Arlo smart cameras will stop working around minus 20 and so will other smart cameras that I've used at home this is what I saw in the app when I did have a ring at the doorbell and when it was minus 17 sometimes it was just green other times the audio was slightly choppy but the video would work but overall in good temperatures and good weather this doorbell has absolutely no problem streaming video answering a call and the two-way audio when you are speaking is crisp and clear in order to access the most amount of features on the Arlo video doorbell you're going to need a subscription to Arlo smart Arlo smart is a cloud service that will store your video clips as well as give you access to the customized motion notifications so in this case it would tell me that there is an animal of the back door or a vehicle or a person and just so that you know right away without looking at your app who is there in Canada the basic package for Arlo smart costs about 1350 for five cameras you get a trial subscription with every Arlo camera so you can test it out and see what you think they look at the night vision on the Arlo video doorbell I was about 10 feet away from the doorbell here you can definitely see that there's a person there it's not very clear that far away but as I approach the door you can get a better look at my face so well this is not necessarily a security camera per se it's not like the Arlo outs or ultra that will track that person as they go through the yard it does provide an accurate look at whoever is there if they come close to the door our low video doorbell also has a built-in siren tap to activate it within the app and this is what it sounds like well it's not overly loud it's definitely enough to annoy the chickens and it is also a good deterrent should someone come into your yard that shouldn't be there at least then they would realize that you have spotted them and that you are sounding the alarm as someone who really loves using Netgear Arlo products I really enjoyed using the Arlo video doorbell it's a great crystal-clear video stream the audio is really really good comparatively to some of the other video doorbells I've tried but it's also seamless and I like how it operates on its own without having to access the Smart Hub therefore not having to run on the same schedule as all of your other cameras I think the Arlo smart cloud service is a great deal especially for five cameras and it's a very good added layer of protection especially if you're already an Arlo user but that's it for my look at the Arlo video doorbell you can see my full written review as well as other photos on beth by canada's blog thanks for watching [Applause]", "0gJSmNCD3Ig": "guys my name is joey and we're at discount vape and today we're going to be talking about troubleshooting a cartesian fake pen [Music] so we're going to do a little bit of a troubleshoot because let me see does this look familiar to anyone the light of death right there it would be a red ring but you know there's not xbox there's ego batteries so this got you used to uh what that looks like and how we can fix that and we'll show you different eagle batteries right here we have a carson's uh spinner and variable voltage which this one is click three times to change the voltage this one you change the voltage just by you know spinning around the wheel to a high number they all work the same way as five clicks on and off except the ego one you know that one's just straight on battery power and a little cartridge just for demo empty so right here on the device like i said you guys are already probably familiar with that light right there anytime you see a light like that in any type of eagle device is basically indicating that there's a connection issue connection issue that's just a broad term it could be many many things it could be the cartridge is bad maybe the device is bad there was liquid that got inside the device um the pin got pulled out because let's say you have an old car that's very leaky and has like a oil it might get pressed against that uh pin inside of the pen it might pull it out so i'm gonna go through different steps on how to like go through those issues first one is the cartridge check on the cartridge especially the pin in the bottom that little pin right there that's the positive and the threads are the negative so let's say if it's too pushed in and does not make uh doesn't reach the connection from the pen it's not gonna work so what you can do is you're gonna take your little nail and try to get it in there and dig it out or a sharp piece like a knife and then you could pull on the actual pin ever so slightly but you don't want to pull it all out because if you do pull it all out then the pin comes out if the pin comes out then that's no point no basically means that the cartridge might be just faulty now and just won't work anymore so i'm just going to push that back in just to show you so you want to have it sticking out ever so slightly the worse you know stick out the better chance that will actually reach to the pin of the actual pen and make a good connection the next step is check the pen check the pins in the pen if you notice all these three different type of pens they have the very similar pins right in the middle if they're too deep in it might not make a connection so same concept you could take something sharp i would say recommend like a toothpick but you can use a knife just don't try to touch the outside walls because you don't want to make both connections because you go short out the device as well but you can you know just dig it out in there and just pull out ever so slightly from the actual pin that's in the middle don't pull that all the way because it does it's just crap it's not gonna work all right so we're gonna screw on the cartridge to the you know the f-dub ego battery that doesn't work all right and now you press on a button and it still doesn't work so you notice that this one is it's a press a bit too high so what we're going to do is we're just going to you know basically try to poke it in with a knife you just poke it in you know a little bit deeper in there and then you're going to screw on the cartridge and now it works see that so sometimes the pin might be too pushed out from the actual device and that might cause an issue so that's a good easy way to fix that issue and we're going to show you how you know basically work on the devices like a box style that goes inside through magnet so the same concept you know make sure to look at the cartridge first remove the magnet make sure the clean thread is in there no and the pin is sticking out ever so you know out screw the magnet back on snug take a q-tip because sometimes it might be just dirty take a q-tip in there cleaning it up and it still doesn't look right and doesn't make a connection same concept take a toothpick get a little bit deeper in there poke on the pin to try to like raise it out a little bit most of the time these are perfectly fine with your spring loaded and then it should work you know without an issue so hopefully you found this video educational and helpful um because i know by reading all the comments that you leave that a lot of people do have issues here and there with the cartridge devices remember always try vice versa a cartridge on a different device or the device on different cartridges sometimes you know one doesn't work with the other it's not compatible i know smart carts have those issues with a lot of different pens so just try it out come to the back to the video come back to our youtube page remember slash discount vape pen you're watching us right now and we have a bunch of different videos on troubleshooting so hopefully you find one way to fix it if not we always got your back

1AAuto.com, your source\nfor quality replacement parts and the best service on the Internet. Hi, I'm Mike from 1A Auto. I hope this how-to video helps you out, and\nnext time you need parts for your vehicle, think of 1AAuto.com. Thanks. In this video, we're going to show you how\nto replace the ABS harness on this 2003 Mercury Mountaineer and we show you on the passenger\nside, but the driver side is the same procedure. The items you'll need for this is a new ABS\nharness from 1AAuto.com; a 14mm, 18mm, and 19mm socket and ratchet with a piece of pipe\nfor extra leverage; a 5mm Allen bit or wrench; flat blade screwdriver; jack and jack stands;\nand a torque wrench. Pry off the hubcap by using a flat blade screwdriver\nin the small slot on the side. Once you get it started, you can just pull\nout around the edges. We'll just fast forward as Mike removes those\n19mm lug nuts. If you don't have air-powered tools, you want\nto loosen them while the vehicle is on the ground, raise the vehicle and remove them\nthe rest of the way. Now you can pull the wheel free. You want to just inspect your brakes. Just take your fingernail and go up and down. You're feeling for any grooves. Small grooves are okay, but anything that\nreally gets your fingernail stuck in there or anything is a little too much. You want to either replace your rotors or\nturn them down. Do the same thing on the back side. You can see the inner pad here. That's got some pretty good life left on it. Then the outer pad, if you look right here,\nyou see between the metal here and the rotor. There's good life on that. The brakes are actually in really good shape\non this. Now just open up this clip with a flat blade\nscrewdriver. You just have to pry the tab and pull it open. Just pry the harness out of this clip and\npull it out of these three. Then you want to remove these two 14mm bolts. We'll just fast forward as Mike does that. Now, using a flat blade screwdriver, just\npry right here and that will push the piston in on the caliper and make it easier to pull\nthe caliper off. Do it again down here and pull the caliper\nfree. You want to set it up and out of the way so\nwe're just going to put it up here. Just to make sure it doesn't fall down, use\na wire tie to just secure it up there. Now pry out your brake pads. The best way to tell the life left in your\npads is this little slot right here is a wear mark, so you can see it pretty much goes away\nonce you have about an eighth of an inch of pads left. Like I said before, these pads have quite\na bit of life left on them. Now remove these two 18mm bolts. You can see he's using a piece of pipe for\nsome extra leverage. When you pull out the last bolt the caliper\nbracket pulls free. Pull your rotor off. Now up here, you want to just reach down here\nbehind your radiator reservoir and just push on the tab on this harness and pull the harness\nfree. Now, just remove this 5mm Allen bolt and you\ncan use another wrench for some extra leverage, if you're using an Allen wrench. Once you break it free, just remove it, and\nthen the harness will just pull out. Then just open up this clip up here with a\nflat blade screwdriver and then pull the harness down. Take your new harness and push it into place,\nthen replace that 5mm Allen bolt. Just tighten that up. We're just going to use our old clips. We're just going to pry off the new clips\nand you could always just pry out your old clips and push these ones into place, but\nours are in good condition, so we're just going to use them. Feed the harness back up and get it up over\nthe control arm and then just clip it back into that clip. Push it back up into place. Take your rotor and push it into place and\nthen replace a lug nut just to hold it there while you reassemble the caliper bracket and\ncaliper. Now take your caliper bracket, line it up\nand then just replace those two 18mm bolts and tighten them up. Then torque both of those to 85 foot-pounds. Push the brake pads back into place and it\nhelps if you have some brake grease on the tabs to help it slide in to those brake pad\nslides. Now, remove your wire tie and pull your caliper\nback down. Then take your caliper and push it back into\nplace over your brake pads. You want to make sure that those slides push\ndown underneath and line up. Once they're lined up, replace those two 14mm\nbolts and tighten them up. Then torque both of those to 25 foot-pounds. Then just push this back into those three\nclips and then back into this bracket  and then close that final clip. Wipe down any dirt you may have gotten on\nyour rotor while replacing the caliper and then remove that lug nut. Replace your wheel, then replace all the lug\nnuts and tighten them preliminarily. Then you'd want to lower the vehicle and tighten\nthem the rest of the way, then torque each of these in a crossing pattern to 100 foot-pounds. Now replace your hubcap. Just line it up and hit it back into place. Then just grab your harness up here and push\nit back into the connector until it clicks. Whenever you've done any work on your brakes\nyou want to just pump the brake pedal until it firms up. Then you want to do a stopping test from five\nmiles per hour, then 10 miles per hour.

it it's a really lightweight package it almost feels like there's only packaging in here but that's because it is a really lightweight little unit if you don't know what a ring flash is used for a lot of fashion photography use it it's a circular I'll show you a circular light source which obviously is really big light source now let me it comes with a few other little accessories I'll just grab those out and then pop the packaging away so comparing the size of that light source to say your pop-up flash obviously huge difference and even a big external flash you can see the light emitting surface of this one is a lot a lot bigger but what's actually special about a ring flash and this is for any ring flash rather than this particular one is you can put the light source around the lens of your camera and you actually get a light that's you know coming from all around the shooting point so you can get perfectly flawless shots so if you're shooting a model for example if you have light coming from every direction around the lens they just won't be shadows on the face because the life coming from this side is offset by the light coming from that side which neutralizes any shadow because they're coming at the same intensity you can of course use this off-camera or off the lens and just have it as a light source like a beauty dish type light off to one side but ring flashes ring flashes are generally really expensive they they can be upwards of 500 $1000 even this one is actually it's not what it's called the Orbis ring flash it's not actually a flash it turns your normal flash into a ring flash it's got a an adapter at the bottom that will take any size flash so the SB 850 problem but then so does the big old 900 essentially it's designed with you know and actually I think really difficult to design a series of chambers inside which reflect the light all around with different surfaces and different angles to make sure that you get an even amount of light coming out from this whole area from your flash and the beautiful thing is I've tested this before the CLS or your you know your creative lighting system your ITT oh all of that sort of thing will still work with this so if you have your Flash attached to your camera and you're telling your camera to do all the metering and then you use this light it will be able to judge how much light am I getting where is it falling and adjust the camera settings so it'll still all work in TTL mode which is really really fantastic now one thing that jumps out about this is forth sighs it feels ridiculously light when I first pick one up at the tradeshow I thought it's so light is the plastic gonna be cheap quality but I can confidently say it the strength to weight ratio is off the chart I wouldn't want to you know run over it with your car or probably even step on it wearing heavy-duty boots but for everyday use and it'll take you know a tumble so I wouldn't worry about that and being nice and light is good because if you're getting into flash equipment everything starts to add up in terms of weight and price so how you can seat this guy any way that you would normally attach your flash to your camera will work with this you can just use one of the tethered cables and then hang it there underneath otherwise they also have an arm which will hold it all in place for you which I'll introduce in a later video but just to give you an idea of it let's just fire off some shots you can see it creates just a really nice ring of flash and for the price I don't know of and for the price it's really good that it can turn any flash into that kind of a big circular light source you know you don't need to have necessarily one of the expensive brand name flashes you can use a cheaper manual one that you've got set on an optical trigger that kind of thing great for getting your flash off camera and it comes with a little adhesive foam so if you are using quite a small flash you can stick that in there and it'll give you the extra grip so that this isn't gonna wiggle around so that's it the Orbis ring fish they have a bunch of different accessories that are available for this one now including the arm that I mentioned which can support it on the bottom of your camera so that you don't actually need to be holding the flash which is really great I'll introduce that one later but if you're into doing off-camera flash stuff and you're looking at getting a ring flash and you know a tossing up $500,000 or being able to modify your existing flash it's a big win you know it's a normal flash when you want it to be then it's a ring flash when you want it to be check them out if you get an opportunity I think you'll be quite surprised with the build quality considering the weight and yeah hope that helps leave me any questions or comments and stay tuned I will be using this on some upcoming shoots I'll pop links in the description below so you can check those out once they're live please click collide click to subscribe and I'll see you soon for more photo news and reviews", "Lok3M6al86Y": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoffman ring officer of honey stick and today I am serving up a nice platter of oil pens for you one of the most commonly frequently asked questions that I get personally and the rest of my service staff get is how do I choose my perfect oil pen and based on the successes of our other videos about how to pick your perfect concentrate and dab pen and also how to pick your perfect concealer well we really worked hard on this week was trying to put together a comprehensive checklist and run through our units to see how you can pick out your perfect oil pen so what our team did we put these factors together and then I did a job job of going out into our warehouse and assembling all of the various units that we have as options for oil pens that we felt viable and we're gonna run through them all based on our eight criteria that I've outlined so let's jump into my criteria I outline and I'm gonna rely on the audience of course to drop into the comments if there's a criteria that I forgot so people who are tuned into the video following along watching the comments can really still see and make the best informed decision that's what our videos are about is really presenting our products and just helping you guys to make a better purchasing decision or to just get a little more education awareness so let's jump into my eight factors my first factor when choosing an oil pen I think is based on the availability based on your state now oils are not necessarily accessible everywhere so it might not even be an option for you but in the event that it is some states they're only have it seemed to be available already prefilled into 510 threaded cartridges or they could be placed into so Changez already pre Lord or they can only be available in tincture bottles so based on what kind type of oils you have access to or what type of texture oils you have access to could really be a determining factor of when you when you're trying to select your perfect oil pen the next factor for you is to keep in mind and I think it's a second probably the most pressing factor is budget I know there's a lot of eight ballers out there who price is not a thing but a lot of medical patients and people who are on let's say disability or things like that that are using cannabis for medicinal purposes budget is a very important thing to them so we can't just go crazy on the price spectrum and we should definitely keep a price as a major factor when choosing a vaporizer as an option the next factor that I think is the most important is how stealthy the unit is so stealthiness can play play a factor in a few ways whether you have it on the go and you want to be discreet whether you just want to be small and compact or whether you are really taking your vaporizer places that you shouldn't and you just don't want to get caught or you want it to go incognito which is perfectly cool but that definitely plays a factor when you are choosing your perfect vape pen I think the next next factor number four is the ease of use is how easy is the oil pen to use and really what is your vape level I have a lot of people who have never turned on a vaporizer before who contact us and we have people who call in to educate us on our own vaporizers on how the best way is to use them so there's different places where you can fall in your vape knowledge spectrum and those will definitely have an impact on your buying decision when you are selecting your pur Victor oil pen is how easy is the vaporizer to use where's my current vape skillset or how am I willing to learn now we do try to make educational videos so that you know even if you do pick up one of the more more expert level vaporizers you know you watch our videos will walk you through how to get it up and running and really be able to use it next I think is battery life you know that comes into play when for me personally like when I'm buying a phone because I cannot stay connected to a charger you know certain people have certain lifestyles they take them on that or they can't get to a charger it takes a they want to be able to have a few days charge on it or they're going on a hiking expeditions is something we've gotten to where they want to make sure they can go about a week without having a charger so the battery life really does play into when you're making a decision of how long and how much you can use it in between charges I think that's important factor when choosing an oil pen next I think it is mobility is can you take it around or is it just gonna be something that kind of stays at home because generally you can get more power and performance out of units that are larger and you can get more kind of back to our other point of of being convenient and easy to use or stealthy out of smaller units so I think that really the mobility factor does play into it as to how and where you plan to take the vaporizer can you drop it in your pocket do you put in your backpack can you just you know throw it on a lanyard or keychain and call it a day next I think it comes down to the next factor really we're going into the nitty-gritty here is the power how much power puts out how intense it is I think that makes a big big determining factor to people because some people really thrive to get an intensity and powerful vaporizer that hits hard and to some people that's believe it or not that that can also be a turn-off to her they want a vaporizer to be very smooth and and and not you know be have any type of traits that to some people could lead off as harsh and I think in the last one is flavor everybody loves to taste good flavor when you're buying spending a lot of money buying concentrates or CBDs or whatever it is that you're buying a nateing sure surrender prefilled cartridge everybody wants to taste what they're getting fact is they're not they're not cheap and people want to get a unique and flavorful experience so where they rank on a flavorful level is also very important when choosing a royal pen so now that we've gone through all the factors and again if I miss something a really thought hard to try not to but if we did make sure to drop in the comments below so people can can see exactly what what other factors they should consider is let's jump right into our different assortment of oil vaporizers and start basically ranking them so you guys have a good knowledge and awareness of where these would rank first off we're a gold or honey stick oil disposable pen now I grab this has had some prefilled CBD in it some a gold lined CBD from our warehouse this pen ships empty so in terms of what you have available whether you if you don't have tinctures or syringes available this is not a 5-10 thread cartridge so you cannot unscrew this cartridge and screw your own cartridge in there so if in your state you only have prefilled cartridges this pen might not be for you however if you have tinctures and syringes available in your state you can definitely use this pen in terms of budget wise this pen is very cost effective because it is a disposable it's not recharged I think it's on our website for $15 so it's very convenient however on the same budget side it's not that economical because once you run through the tanks you would have to buy a new one and once you've ran through two three four of these you could have bought a rechargeable pen and price saved a little money in the wrong long run but if you're traveling or you live that certain lifestyle to where you don't want to take care of a pen maintain a pen you just want it to go through the tank or the the tincture or the syringe then this pen does definitely become convenient in terms of stealthy it's not stealthy in the sense of hiding the pan or the cartridge but it is stealthy in the sense that it looks similar to a lot of illiquid units and it can be disguise' belit is relatively small I mean it's basically about four and a half maybe five inches in length you can easily fit it into your pocket each one comes with a plastic tube and we did do a full review on this oil disposable pen it's actually very easy to use you just unscrew the top to fill it and we do have a step-by-step on there and there's no buttons to push no locking mechanisms you just inhale in terms of battery life this battery is good to run through the tank I tell people it is you should only really rely on it to run through the tank once even if the battery is not completely dead you don't want to get caught refilling the tank and then having to try to siphon or salvage oil out of a disposable pen because then you do have wastage and it is expensive so these they generally say are good for 200 puffs or one tank which if you look at the number of puffs on a half a mil which is the capacity of this tank it's between 150 and 200 puffs so that's what the battery life is mobility this thing is very mobile very convenient for traveling running around it's small it is extreme lightweight.you basically you could have a real lanyard and not even feel that it's here in terms of power that this unit doesn't have a high output this is more focused on smoothness and flavor it is auto draw and in general and again I say this is in general push-button units tend to hit harder than auto draw units simply because you're not using the power of your actual draw to activate the unit so this is a very flavorful a ceramic heating core and it it is not super intense it is more of a very smooth rolling and flavorful hits so that's where our disposable oil pan ranks one really select your perfect oil pan it is convenience oriented it is lightweight mobile flavorful but isn't going to deliver those those hard hits it's not rechargeable and it will not work with 510 threaded cartridges so let's move right along to one step up now this is not a unit that we have on our website however a lot of you guys have seen these these are the stylist standard disposable units this one we make exclusively for one of our distributors it's called the honey stick bee buzzin it is a stylus battery that comes with a high quality classic plastic wick cartridge what's cool about this stylus pen is it's basically the next step up from just plain disposable a lot of people do view these pens as disposable even though it is rechargeable in terms of availability this no matter what type of oils you have available whether it's prefilled cartridges or whether it's tinctures or syringes you can if you buy this kit you're able to use it because it does have a 5-10 thread battery that cartridges can screw on to however these auto draw batteries are not the modernized drawers like in the elf so if you're a cartridge is a high-capacity ceramic cartridge or a really wide cartridge battery could be a little underpowered in terms of budget price these pens retail for about twenty to twenty-five dollars they are their simple easy to use there's a very budget kit it's a very budget starter kit it is auto draw you know and with this carry case on our next level it is pretty stealthy because you just have in this little wallet case slip it into your pocket and you're not gonna hear or say anything about but once you have the the actual cartridge and the battery screwed on you know that that stealthiness kind of does go away now this cartridge is very similar to the cartridge that we have stock in our beekeeper unit and we have a detailed video on how to to fill this unit how to fill this year and up and it is actually very easy to fill up and to function there's no buttons there's no clicking there is no unlocking you just simply fill up the cartridge screw it onto the battery and your ready to vape it is an auto draws very easy to use battery life battery life for a rechargeable unit it probably does fall on the lowest end of the spectrum of our comparison it is basically about the same battery life if not less than our disposable unit so this thing it is you are gonna need to charge it more if you're on the go when it is charged up it's definitely gonna give you some good hits you're gonna run good with it but it is it is really the entry-level unit if you're just getting into vaping don't know of vaping z' for you you want to pick up a nice cost-effective kit that is gonna be easy for you to get started with just to see if you like vaping but it's not you know gonna be your daily driver or your long hauler mobility with the carrying case and even without it's a very lightweight it is a mobile we unit so you're gonna be able to run around with it you know it's it's a very small compact it is a little bit taller than our previous unit by about an inch with the cartridge on there and power this is an auto draw unit and it does have a more basic cartridge which has a wick so in terms of power they're not going to be that powerful when you when you draw you're not gonna get monster clouds because first of all it's not push-button second of all is because it's more of a traditional cartridge however it is very reliable of a unit now in terms of flavor again these kits were not knocking them at all we do make them they're very entry level in terms of flavor I don't think that you will get blown away you would have to switch it out to a different cartridge if you have very high quality extracts then I would probably consider upgrading the cartridge or stepping into a different level of a kit but very basic very good way to get started very easy to use lightweight a starter kit on that end all right next up our upgrade from our disposable pen we have our Gold Line vape battery okay which is a push-button variable temperature battery we did a very thorough review of this and it is actually paired up with our cloud tank here what's cool about this batteries it's 510 thread it works with all 510 thread batteries and also if you purchase this cartridge you can definitely take advantage of tinctures and syringes so in terms of what's available in your state if you buy one of these you're basically covered on all your ends in terms of budget this tank goes for I think $12 on our website and the the battery is $20 so it's actually your under $35 for this starter kit the way that it is and for that price you are getting a lot of bang for the buck because you are getting a very good battery it has three different temperatures it has preheat mode you know also chargeable very good we did a full detailed review of this pen if you want to see the features and specs it is actually very easy to use however because it's push-button it adds you know one level over the auto draw units that we just discussed here so you would definitely have to have some very basic vape knowledge but again this knowledge is very basic nothing to get freaked out about battery life this unit has a high-capacity battery it has a 650 mah battery so it is actually a very high capacity battery for a little vaporizer which is actually more than twice the the capacity of this so if you're looking for something more on-the-go and something that is definitely going to go to need less charges this is is a better unit option for that in terms of mobility it is a little bit long but it's still relatively light can still fit into your pocket still very transportable light enough to hold on a lanyard but it is a little bit long in terms of mobility in terms of power it has three intensity settings so you can hone in on what power you feel comfortable with so if you're not sure what you're gonna like it's definitely a good idea to have something that has variable temperatures and on the most intense setting a lot of our customers even have commented on the YouTube channels of of this pen that it hits really solid so for a small pen it definitely delivers the power if you pair this with not somebody else's prefilled tank you're filling your own you pair it with our cloud tank with a ceramic heater you're definitely gonna get good flavor so I really think that where does this pen rank in terms of an oil pen I think if you're looking for a beginner pen on a budget you cannot go wrong with this pen and it is a deftly a solid choice and the first step to get into the big leagues now let's move on to our most popular vaporizer that's being sold as the honey stick beekeeper it is a concealer so it is it's also been ranked by a lot of people as one of the best oil pens and the cartridge it comes with is a thick oil similar to the disposable very basic because most people do utilize 510 threaded cartridges it works on magnet adapter we have a very detailed video about this this this unit so because it does come with a tank you can use it for basically everything from tinctures to syringes and also 510 thread tanks that you could screw the magnet adapter on so no matter what your state has going on if you pick up a beekeeper more than likely you're gonna be able to take advantage of that it's pretty cost effective unit its selling on our website for 39.99 so it really isn't a big high-dollar unit and it delivers a lot stealthiness the concealer unit because it keeps the cartridge concealed it is actually very small as you can see here it definitely ranks very high on the stealth factor nobody really knows what's going on on top of it all it's a matte black looking like a stealth bomber I think it ranks very high in that level ease of use there's no variable temperatures there's one small button that's push button five clicks on five clicks off push and hold while you inhale super easy to use you can see our detailed video on that battery life this unit also has a high capacity battery which is just about twice the capacity of of these standard batteries so you're definitely going to be able to take this on the go more and get more out of it mobility I don't think you have a much more mobile unit to carry around it'll fit into your little jean pocket wherever slide into a little bitty groove into the purse it's not much bigger than a little thing of lipstick so in terms of power the beekeeper definitely does deliver power it doesn't have variable intensity sync so if you don't like a larger volume inhale you know you can't adjust it down real so it has a good power spectrum that delivers nice power if you're looking for flavor I really highly recommend you buy the high-performance beekeeper cartridge which has a wickless ceramic heater in it and it definitely brings out a lot more flavor notes and smoothens it out if you're filling your own cartridge and if you put your Magna dap tour on there it just drops in it even has a very cool stainless steel tip alright so now we're moving right along to our elf unit we just got done going over the beekeeper so the elf has basically a lot of the same characteristics in the sense that it's a very small actually a little bit smaller than the beekeeper concealer that works well with but that's a magnetic that works well with prefilled cartridges tinctures as well as fills a notable differences is the elf already comes with high performance good tasting ceramic cartridge so you can get a little bit more performance out of the stock elf cartridge it's glass then the stock beekeeper cartridge that that one comes with however a notable difference is they have the same battery capacity but this one is actually easier to use because it is buttonless so you don't have to unlock anything it is an auto draw unit now even though a lot of times Auto draw units are less powerful a lot of people have set the elf is actually a very powerful auto draw unit because the sensitivity of the sensor when you start drawing so you're still gonna get good power you're gonna get better flavor the unit is actually very stealthy it's a little bit easier to use if you're just getting started you don't like pushing small buttons a lot of people say they're medical medical condition doesn't let them to to push small buttons so it's very easy to draw the unit is very mobile has good power and because the high performance cartridge you do to a little bit of extra flavor out of it so this is also another good concealer now if you looked at the if you determine that hey I need a concealer based off of you know the characteristics that we went through our eight important factors but you want something that has a little bit more or has a little bit more battery power your next step up is our phantom unit which our phantom unit is basically a concealer as you could see it's very similar in size it's a little bit bigger but the reason it's a little bit bigger is it has two and a half times the battery capacity of the elf and the phantom so you're gonna go a lot more between charges it's also squeeze action so it's you're not pushing any small buttons however were the key differences is that it has four different temperature settings so you can really tune in on that power and flavor level that you want it comes with a high performance cartridge and what's cool is it also comes with I don't have it here on the table actually I do it even comes with a wax adapter cartridge so if the availability of prefilled cartridges oils that you can fill aren't there but waxes are you have the wax adapter as well so it really allows you to be very very versatile when you're using the phantom it's a very cool looking unit feels very good extremely stealthy because you can't see the cartridge still small but it does have more power more capacity and it has a four available temperature settings on here again we have a couple very in-depth videos about this year on the channel so if you're a going concealer this is probably where you're gonna be however it does cost more it is our most expensive concealer that we have over here which on our website think it's about 129 on here but really solid unit just you can feel the quality so if you're not sure if you want something like a stick a battery or concealer and you want something in between and you're really trying to get the vaporizer into places a vaporizer shouldn't be we have our minimax Pro which is a switchblade action key fob battery which will does not come with a cartridge the elf phantom and the beekeeper all come with their cartridges so if your state or your availability doesn't have 510 thread cartridges you will need to buy a cartridge to pair this with in order to get it functioning it is not that expensive of a unit it retails on our website for $40 it is pretty easy to use it does have three temperature settings but it only has one button here that you push so you'd have to unlock it and relock it and cycle through the temperatures through here what is cool about it is that it does have a pretty high capacity battery it has a 650 million power battery so it does actually have more capacity than the elf and the beekeepers so it falls kind of right in between these two units in terms of battery life the thing about it is though is it is extremely stealthy because it was designed like a car key it even fits on your keyring so it's extremely mobile so you can see the cartridge hides over here and you push the button and it flips open so you keep it completely hidden this is where the key would be I mean this thing is gonna fly under the radar basically wherever you have it as long as you pair it with your wallet or have it on your keychain because the three power levels that it has you can wind up the intense and you can get some really good power rips out and I know some people posted reviews on our in-depth video about this product and they said that on the third power level they will have able to get some really good strong power and depending on what cartridge you pair it with if you have it paired with like a cloud tank like our cloud tank on our website that has a good smooth ceramic flow your also get some really good flavor notes out of it so this little unit if you're really stealthiness is super important to you but you still want to have some good features in there and stay keep a pen that's you know under $50 pad your you're looking pretty good with the minimax Pro for your oil needs so we just went over all these regular oil and cartridge devices now I want to take take the next step to jump into a new level of vaporizer which is our sub ohm I have a video that really goes into sub ohm and oil vaping and I really truly do believe it as a future trend a lot of customers do ask me hey what if I just buy the most expensive pen is it the best pen or not well the short answer is generally the most expensive pens are better and more performance but it still might not fit your personal 8 characteristics that we went through as good as some of the other pens but the sub ohms are our favorite they're one of our fastest growing areas and honey stick is really one of the best innovators in this area so let's start off if you like the concealer but you want a sub ohm we have our old unit the Ripper which we actually have the new one here's the shell of it I don't have a finished unit because they are gonna be delivered this week so just a couple more days guys I know a lot of people put in their pre-orders and the new version is actually gonna look just like this really cool shell and it's gonna be a two in one it's actually gonna have a wax adapter as well but the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer so now just really really quickly what a sub ohm unit does is it just brings really low resistance really high power and intensity and what I would say is much greater flavour notes to oils and I put up a video about sub ohm oil vaping and we've reviewed a lot of our sub ohm devices now the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer it does not work with 510 thread cartridges so if you only have 510 thread cartridges in your state this is probably not a vaporizers that you're gonna pick up because you either need tinctures or syringes but it is actually disguised to look as a lighter you flip it open you have your button you know it has it has a telescopic mouthpiece that comes out here and we will have a full review of a ripper when it's in stock it only has one temperature setting which is in tense however this unit is extremely stealthy a lot of people have confused it as a lighter it's very easy to use because it doesn't have any digital settings it's not variable temperature it's just a 5 click lock and because the lock is covered you don't even really have to keep it locked the the cartridges just pop in and out which you do have to fill because they are subohm they just pop in and the top screws on it's a very simple extremely durable mechanism it does have an ultra high-capacity battery which actually has about 20% more capacity than even our phantom so very high-capacity battery it's extremely mobile extremely durable very tough unit and on the power scale it is off the charts in terms of intensity you can YouTube some videos of people using this device in terms of flavor I feel it has better flavor than most cartridges however when we get down into our digital mods and tanks you can really fine-tune the flavor so I think in subohm in the sub own category it has better flavor than a lot of standard units however because of all the power and because you can't really fine-tune it in it's definitely higher on the power and intensity spectrum that is on the flavor spectrum for sub ohm so that's our Ripper check out the full review on that one so moving into the sub ohms we really have two units that a lot of people often compare and contrast we have our our Cannabis Cup winning sub ohm original kit which a lot of people on the YouTube channel refer to as the OG cannabis cup kit really like that name possible name change there and our newest sub ohm Sport kit now both of them have very high capacity batteries both of them have really awesome tanks both of them are in terms of budget wise they're definitely on the higher end of the spectrum there there both under $200 the subohm sport is 169 and the sub-ohm original kit is right around that $200 mark so these aren't your regular budget kits these are your luxury kits but they definitely perform now in terms of availability of what you have available if you have 510 thread cartridges available you're not going to be will unscrew this tank and use a 5-10 thread cartridge on this battery without an ego adapter on our sub ohm og kit you do have an ego adapter that you unscrew right here you just flip this over put it back onto your battery and you're able to use 510 thread cartridges you can fill these with syringes or tinctures I would probably not consider these as stealthy as versatile and versatile even though they do fit into the pocket they are heavier I mean that's a good in terms of a quality standpoint but they do have a little bit of half so in terms of mobility and you know stealthiness you don't really get away with that the subohm sport is slightly stealthier than the OG kit because it has a window covering around the glass so you don't really see what's in there it also offers a little bit more protection now the battery life these things are both ultra high capacity they're way over the 1500 mAh as well so you get a lot of capacity of these you charge these things up a lot of people go days without getting a charge even without having to recharge it even our very heavy daily users both these units you can dial up the power big-time this one goes up to 36 watts which is more than what you will need this one actually goes all the way up to 60 watts which is definitely way more than you're ever really gonna need which which can just really you know melt the whole power spectrum in terms of hits now in terms of flavor they're going to be a little bit different you can use a blender option on here which uses a solid block ceramic heater and then this one uses a ceramic and Kanthal heater in here which has different bottom draw and orifice holes a lot of people say that this kid is really easy to get started with but basically you start off with this kit and then you graduate into kind of this tank with the the taste delivery and the power and how you're actually able to use as a blender and put solid concentrates into there so power these kits are both way up in the spectrum flavor I would say they're both up there and the very high rankings of flavor but once you you know really want to fine-tune your experience there's nothing really like the og cannabis cup kit that's what the judges and socal thought and really that's what a lot of our audience things but these kids are really closely matched now the only other thing that I can say to add to these two that's going to decrease your mobility but increase the power and flavor you're gonna be all have on tap is adding our bumblebee bubbler we did a full review and demo on this with honey girl or another one of our videos is you can pair it with our sub ohm devices and it can because you'll run it through water you can really crank up the power and really smooth out even more flavor to take your vaping experiences to all new levels however what's this gonna do to your oil pen definitely gonna increase you know it's gonna sorry decrease your mobility it's definitely gonna decrease any stealthiness that you had it's gonna increase the power I would say it will definitely increase the flavor notes as well it's gonna tack on another about 20 to 30 bucks to your budget cuz you're watching this video so you're gonna wait for the discount code at the end and it's also what's cool about those availability wise you can actually pair this thing with 510 thread cartridges to still put them on so this is still compatible with 510 thread cartridges so that's the bubbler lastly the only other way that you can improve your oil vaping experience is by having a battery like our speed barrier it has a lot of features but you have to be a really an expert vape level to really use this battery you can set the Watts in just fine but there's features and temperature controls and how you want your power to come on that you're not gonna get in standard batteries it really takes a step above even these two batteries and it has twice the capacity and power availability of both these batteries so you know you can also get one of these batteries to pair with your oil tanks however this battery is too powerful for a lot of little oil tanks so it's not gonna be fully compatible there alright so just to summarize guys thank you so much for tuning in I hope that walking through our old oil devices and showing you guys how we rank them in terms of what's available to you your budget your stealthiness your ease of use - battery life mobility power and flavor

boiling cool to the touch safe stovetop and a lot of control over delicate foods but a lot of people don't know what type of cookware you can use on induction cast-iron stainless steel anything that's magnetic on the bottom of the surface even nonstick cookware can be compatible with adduction so my name is Damien Gaudin general manager of crystal company ice Inc in France induction is approximately 10% of the of the market for s addiction is the future - I'm right is the analog nouvelle stainless steel and you'll see that on the bottom of the pan an induction compatible base and any any material that you can put a magnet to will work on an induction stove not only into faster temperature of course it's very quick to obtain the - to boil for example one litre of water it's the stability of the temperature - it so even nonstick cookware can work that's right that's right it can as long as it has a metal base on we are seeing an uptick in the use of induction cookware we see

is attempted is making sure that we have a good rough alignment and softwood I personally like to do a rough alignment before I do stuff but just in case that the base is slightly warped or has some uneven contact with the motor or pump then when we do a rough alignment it will be roughly sitting where we want it to be sitting so it will give us a bit more accurate readings for softwood so to start a rough alignment take your straight edge and place it on the rim of one of the coupling caps I'd like to point out that if you are using a straight edge you need to put it so it's resting only on one half not on both Hassell common mistake that people make is that they place it against both coupling halves and that you end up getting a bit of a gap in two places and if you're pretty close it can be hard to decipher and see that small gap so by holding it against one half of the coupling you can then see the gap on the opposite side then it's a good idea to take something like a shim and place it in between the gap so that you can see the amount that you need to move up on your motor or other machine if you're doing a rough alignment so I found a better example of how it can be so easy to misinterpret how the ruler is sitting on our coupling if I wants to hold the ruler on both halves here it looks like it's resting pretty squarely on both however if I hold it just solely on this half of the coupling you can see now that I've got just a tiniest little bit of space there showing to me that I do have misalignment a little tiny bit of offset besides using a straightedge to do a rough alignment we can also use a set of calipers like we have here maybe this is a set of inside calipers so what I'm going to do on this coupling is measure the distance between the spaces here on the coupling and the spaces here and if it's the same then that tells me I have no angular misalignment if it's different that says that it could shifted one way or the other I'm going to start actually on this side here I've already pre-measured this to get it just close so just touching now if I come to this side you can see that it doesn't really go in we have a smaller gap on this side and a larger gap on this side that set tells me that the shaft of the motor is sitting the back end of the motor sitting one way kind of like this here so we could then shift the motor so that the gap is the same on both sides then we know our angular misalignment is fairly close we want our rough alignments to be within 10 topically one thing you'll notice about this motor is that the motor feet it's flat between each foot so the base along the whole bottom of the motor touches the base plate of our machine here this is one reason why I like to do a rough alignment first of it if I had a high spot in the middle I know that I'm not high centering my motor and causing soft foot so I'm going to do a rough alignment here and I'm going to put some shims under both corners to bring it up so that I know that it's resting only on the feet and not in the center as well so here we're going to look at one of our motor beats it's going to check this motor foot for soft foot now tighten all the bolts that are holding the motor down to 20 foot pounds making sure that the motor is nice and evenly torque using a torque wrench not just a set of wrenches now I'm going to loosen one bolt at a time now taking the first thin feeler gauge this in this example here is a one and a half file file or gauge I'm going to place it and see if I can slide it underneath the corner of these motor feet now the advantage of using feeler gauge over a dial indicator is that we can check for angular soft foot in this case I'm able to stick my one and a half thousand gauge so I'm going to go up to the next size and see if I can get a tooth our a three thousand or gauge you start to get a two thousand two there and the two thousand on the inside of the foot so move over to a3 see how that works well the three starts to get a little tight there and it definitely doesn't go in on the outside of the foot so once again you can see this is my 2008 it goes in quite far on the inside of the foot or the outside of the foot I can get it under just a little bit and that's about where it stops so it's me that says that I've got a little bit of angular soft foot the toe of my foot is down a little bit more than the inside of my foot so if this I wanted to fix if it was any more than one foul one use a step shim but in this case it's not too bad you", "Len6fgiQlEs": "brought to you by 1a auto calm your source for quality replacement parts and the best service on the Internet hi I'm Mike from 1a auto I hope this how-to video helps you out and please next time you need parts for your vehicle think of 1a auto calm in this video we're going to show you how to replace the rear differential cover on this 2002 Chevy Suburban and the items that you'll need for this is a new rear differential cover from 1a auto calm 13 millimeter socket and ratchet with an extension 3/8 inch ratchet hammer and cold chisel vacuum razor blade rags wire brush drip pan differential fluid and jack and jack stands okay the rear differential covers right up under back here we do have the spare tire removed on the suburban makes a little easier and the bolts on our vehicle are pretty rusty and that's usually what happens these differential covers actually roughed out so what we're doing is using a cold chisel and just knocking the scale off of each side of the bolt and now the bolts are actually thirteen millimeter but what we found is since we took that scale off it's slightly smaller so we're driving a half-inch socket on there and that gets us a good enough grip to get them all out and we'll just repeat that process for all ten or all ten of the bolts you make sure you have a drip pan below the differential cover before you remove the last of the bottom bolts and you want to just remove those now using your chisel just hammer out on the bottom of the diff cover and then replace the bolt at the top of the differential cover and then use your chisel and hammer again on the other side and just let the fluid drain out after it's drained for a while just pry out on the bottom and then remove that bolt and then pull the cover down and out now if any debris falls down inside of here vacuum all of it out and then take a rag make sure it's somewhat clean and just wipe everything down and just stick this rag back in there and then using a razor blade just cut off that old gasket along the outside and then just use a wire brush to get any leftover residue of the gasket okay the new differential cover from Wado does come with a gasket but we use a small bead of RTV on each side of the gasket just to make sure it has a good seal and just make sure it's pressed down into place and then trace it with more RTV make sure there's no fluid on the outside here and then take your differential cover and feed it up into place and you want to just replace the top bolt to hold it in and then we'll just fast forward as he replaces the rest of the bolts and make sure for this top bolt that you put this harness back into place then let the gasket sit for a minute if you used RTV and then tighten each of those bolts up and then you want to just torque each of these two 15 foot-pounds in a crossing pattern you never move this filler plug using your 3/8 ratchet and ours has been kind of rough condition so I'm just going to hammer the ratchet in place and then just remove that plug now replace the differential fluid and you want to just do this until it starts to pour over the side and when it starts to pour over the side you can just put your pinky in there and make sure that the fluids right to the top of the filler hole and if it is then you're all set and you can replace your cap I'll just tighten it up with your ratchet and you're all set we hope this

covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest

we've had it sitting upstairs we have not opened it and I don't know why but today's the day that we are going to crack this guy open and make whatever that thing is so right now I'm on the Buffs are right next to me actually they're over there playing Robo blocks tower about those oh my god I'm just gonna figure out how to get to Sigma I don't open let's see what this thing looks like I feel pretty comfortable doing a dump of this guy so it's gonna happen okay that's clearly not coming out like ever Wow I forgot how modular these cool atomic is are and I love it literally everything is in Japanese pretty amazing if I remember correctly these are a bunch of inserts stickers and stuff once I get this set up I'm gonna bring out all the time I guess that we have and see how big of a mega full table city we can make it going check this out remember these cool atomic is this is a lot of pictures a lot of words I don't know what this says but you know what we're just gonna start it at step number one and fumble my way through this do do you ready all right Oh baby you got to blew it out I got the white went out it's definitely a garage right it looks like this will push the cars out yeah right there it's like a little clip and then it looks like you can actually cook in these garages Wow okay let's stay organized I'm gonna put this one here and then we just open up this one to put this right here you got this one let's see till we open these next yes are these stuck together on purpose is that for shipping for shipping okay so it looks like these peel apart it's a green one which one do you need a big one small one ooh nice I like where you're going with this by the way I don't know what any of this says but I think that this is the sticker section do you see a little house a little tiny house with the roof oh that's it I see a little roof oh dude that was totally a kid I sweets whoo beautiful window here let's see if I can get it one fell swoop window balcony with bushes also windows what whoa all right stickers have done on this cube do this and I can open it close it wait there's an order here I go glass window first then roof then gate yes we got sticker on the front because there's stickers in the back nice all right Biebs I have the fast food restaurant finished you can kind of see the background poking through beautiful totally beautiful there you are breath all right this looks like to be the seafood market I think let's see oh yeah definitely the seafood market whoo all right it's gonna go I guess on top first part sign made hamburger sign made I like how there's no like company name it this is hamburger so actually look take this apart all right so this snaps on like so oh that adds so much now it's starting to look really sharp right so now this one goes on like this oh this might be backwards but I can fix that it looks like this can only snap on the fresh rice malt yep that needs to be flipped like that fixed much better guys I was able through a process of elimination to figure out where each of these stickers went so we had the fresh part done we have the hamburger shop the flower shop this is the ATM this I'm not completely sure but I think it might be a doctor's office whatever it is says not sure and we have some signs drive-through parking in whatever this thing is we have multiples of e okay guys the beautiful thing about this thing is that how modular it is but look at this like gigantic Tower of food that is what I'm gonna make first okay first level at it guys what does this say yours who can read speak Japanese let me know in the comment Oh the boot that's a bus stop I see a little bus icon there oh my goodness that's gonna go right here in the corner [Music] coming through also why is an eyeball on the table do you think this is a doctor's office I think so that's gonna go right above the hamburger shop just like so this is getting nice and tall guys and woke up with a fresh Mart the first parts gonna go right on top this is gonna be like some super urban really cool Center whoa I don't know how this reads on camera but you can actually see within the plastic all the different like backgrounds and looks really beautiful okay because every factory some stuff I've added this thing right here what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a little drive-through way right here so we need some sort of support yes I totally fits and right above the fray yeah look guys maybe support that's amazing Thanks awesome Ubu safety first come on cuz it's a grayling here people might walk to my fault safety really for those of you wondering how we're actually gonna obtain access to this middle one let me just show you coming through coming through coming through whom and I actually work surprisingly well I think you can just click it in just like so Wow but apparently the fresh smart according to the instructions they just axes the via helicopter these what do you think the flower shops should go that's super important but you think wow what do you think we should put it right next to the bladder right here or right here right here dude that's such a good idea look at that let's see what it looks like from far away oh yeah and because it looks like you're working on a police station right here what do you think is it connect we're the light earth going down alright let's do this thing let's just slide this thing over and let's slide this up towards us and then it looks like it can access either right here we can figure it out parking lot can go right

V Rogers signing off bye", "Pb6nXV-iamI": "hello and welcome to two car pros today we're going to do an ABS warning light troubleshooting guide when this light is on it means the system is disabled so you're in a situation where the car needs to use the system it won't work and you may lose control of the vehicle and ABS sensor is used to detect and monitor wheel rotation while providing feedback information to the ABS module or controller with this information the controller can drop brake line pressure to a particular wheel to allow it to start rolling again which helps it regain traction and control the car which avoids accidents if you have an ABS light that is on don't worry we've created a guide for everyday people just like you that want to fix this problem without the help of a fancy code scanner while using basic tools like a test light and a voltmeter this information can also provide guidance to someone that's having their car repaired at a garage the first step when you see an ABS light is to check the system views this is done using a simple test light there are two reasons for this fuse to fail the first reason is it simply becomes weak and fails the second is a short in the system when this occurs is usually the ABS pump motor or controller check the ABS fuse if the fuse checks out okay please continue on to step 2 if you found this video helpful in any way please give it a like this is a close-up shot of a blown fuse just for reference step 2 all ABS equipped cars are designed with four wheel speed sensors these sensors are located at each wheel and monitor the rotation via a reluctor which is mounted to the brake rotor CV joint or rear axle slowly rotate the ring to check it for damage or missing teeth when the reluctor spins by the magnetic sensor it creates alternating current or AC voltage the faster it spins the more voltage it creates this voltage is sent to the controller as feedback information all wheel speeds are monitored and adjusted in a hard braking or skid event you should think of this operation as a small electric hammer tapping each wheel sensor this constant barrage of voltage generation causes the sensors to fail which is common the trick becomes to test each sensor which can easily be done using a voltmeter set to AC voltage since the sensor is magnetic check it for metal shavings around the sensor which can stop it from picking up the correct voltage slowly spin the axle or hub which will produce the voltage if no readings can be found the sensor has failed and a replacement is required the air gap between the sensor and the reluctor wheel must be between 0.45 to 1.1 millimeters if this air gap is too wide or too close it could be a sign of a bad wheel bearing with the wheel sensor disconnected and ohms test should read the resistance of 700 to 13 hundred ohms depending on the temperature and manufacturer if no resistance is observed the sensor has an open circuit and has failed step 3 the final and most common failures of the ABS system and the cause for an ABS warning light to be on is the controller itself this pump motor computer is used to monitor the system and control each of the four valves and pump a portion of the brake system these units include the electronics and the system control relay which enables and disables the system when the key is off if the key is off and you can still hear the ABS pump running this relay has failed replacement of the module is required other failures include the ABS warning light which indicates a direct failure of the operation of the internal working of the module if you've gone through all these things and the light is still on the only other alternative is an open circuit somewhere in the wiring which can sometimes be difficult to find while using a specific wiring diagram use a voltmeter set 2 ohms of resistance to check each wire from one end to the other end of the system this will help detect a broken or shortened wire which once repaired the light should turn off thank you so much for watching if you have any questions please visit de carros comm", "-TW1Hjc6t4Y": "digital twin is a state-of-the-art solution for predictive maintenance of marine assets in practical terms into digital representation of physical assets that provides real-time information of the condition of an asset here the digital twin is created with a digital model of an azimuth thruster driveline and attaching a physical torque sensor to the shaft of the asset providing input data of real-world operation physics based simulation enables measurement to the real-time torque in any location of the power line as if it was actually measured from the physical asset with virtual sensor technology you can get the best of both worlds without the need of compromising between the accuracy of the internal sensors and the cost efficiency of external sensors virtual sensor data is further fed into the individual component lifing models these models predict the remaining lifetime of the components based on the actual operating profile in environmental conditions all the information provided by the digital twin is available both locally and everywhere in the world to reduce satellite connection costs data size is optimized by performing computationally demanding data processing on board before transferring over the network digital twin provides an easy-to-use dashboard to access all information from anywhere the online dashboard delivers you detailed analysis to support your decision-making with digital twin technology

businesses select source fill and ultimately find packaging for plant-based essential oil vaporizer pans so today we're gonna address a question that has been coming up for one of our new product lines what is C cell C cell very simply put is probably one of the most disruptive technologies to hit the vaporizer pen space in quite a while what C cell is is actually ceramic coil technology it is based around a ceramic coil that has been specially designed to absorb and vaporize plant-based essential oils at a high rate producing large clouds of vapor a lot of flavor and a really intensified user experience now how does C cell do this how does what makes C cells so special makes it so important and how exactly does it accomplish this kind of disruptive performance well C cell has a ceramic corn rather than a fabric wick based core what that means is that it's able to vaporize much higher viscosity essential oils without any problems and what it does is it pairs this coil with a high performance battery this is a high discharge lithium-ion battery that allows the coil to heat up quicker then most other coils do thus producing much bigger clouds of vapor upon exhale what this does is this provides two huge benefits for businesses who are looking to engage the C cell platform for their own use number one it provides a very standout user experience meaning that when you place your essential oils into a C cell your users are gonna notice they're gonna notice that the vapor clouds that they're producing are much bigger the hits they're taking is much bigger and to follow on the heels of that the second huge benefit for businesses looking to engage the C cell platform is the rate of consumption of the oil meaning that once you put your oil into a C cell cartridge it's gonna get consumed by the user at one point five to two times quicker than in a normal vaporizer pen this is because C cell has designed their entire pen for optimum performance I really like to compare C cell to a Ferrari and most other normal vaporizer pens to a Honda there's nothing wrong with a Honda I have a Honda love Honda but Honda is meant to be efficient and it's meant to be friendly to the normal everyday consumer but if you're looking for performance if you're looking for really high performance you're not gonna buy a Honda you're more than likely gonna buy a Ferrari right if you have the money for it Wow what makes a Ferrari special well a Ferrari is built from the ground up to be for for performance right everything from the tires to the suspension to the chassis to even the seat that the driver sits in is all made for performance that is what makes C self special everything on the C cell platform is designed for performance it basically allows you to vaporize your oils evenly without burning them while also pairing that with a high discharged battery that delivers more power thus allowing you to have larger hits so C cell from the ground up is designed for performance in a way that normal vaporizer pens cannot match so let's begin by taking a look at the entire C cell lineup before we drill down into the individual components of this lineup so that you as a user or as a brand are familiar with the C cell platform as you engage in it now it's worth noting that C cell likes to keep its lineup very sleek and minimalist there's only about five different C sell products however with a combination of different material finishes as well as branding options there's really a lot of ways that you can begin to express your brand through C cell now to start here on the cartridge side of things Cecil offers two different cartridges their first cartridge is called the th2 cartridge it is we refer to it internally as the c2 cartridge so when you call us and ask for this cartridge you can refer to it as either the th 2 or the C 2 cartridge however it is a glass cartridge with a ceramic tip onto it and this is really CISOs flagship cartridge when the user puts their lip on the their lips on the ceramic tip they instantly notice the quality and how this is a much heavier as well as better built cartridge than they may have be used to engaging with and what it does is it really makes any plant-based essential oil that's placed into this cartridge stand out from the pack now if you want to have that same sort of performance in a more cost effective packaging Cecil offer also offers the m60 which we refer to internally as the c6 but also available in a half gram as well as a 1 gram size but the entire body is made of plastic so that is a plastic body as well as a plastic mouthpiece even though this provides a slower price you still get a hundred percent of the performance because it has the patented C sell coil technology on the inside so there is no difference in performance between the glass cartridge or the plastic cartridge just a difference in material finish as well as cost now let's move on to the batteries very quickly you have two types of batteries for C so both of which are Auto and Hale batteries it means that they are not button activated see cell likes to have a user interface again very Apple like that is very easy to use and easy for a customer to learn to you so with both of these batteries once you put your cartridge on it you simply inhale in it that battery will automatically activate now first is the m3 battery which we refer to as just the C cell battery internally when you take this battery and you connect it to AC cell cartridge you end up with a very ecig like appearance that allows for a lot of description of discretion without any loss in performance this is a 350 mAh battery which means that it will last the typical user about a week before they have to recharge it now the newest battery to the C cell lineup is actually the palm battery here and this is a very interesting battery this actually has a drop-in design with a magnetic connector which means that you can drop in your cartridge and it won't fall out even though you don't have to screw anything in it allows the user to then also place it in the palm of their hand for maximum discretion while they're using it so that no one can see really what they're inhaling and this is a great option if you are really trying to express maximum discretion through your brand or for your users now lastly here we have the C cell disposable pen this is really the penultimate in terms of ease of use there's nothing to recharge there's nothing to refill you simply place your oil inside this disposable pen use it until it doesn't work anymore and then you throw it away and buy another so if either you as a user or as a brand you're choosing to engage this platform just know that if you really want to be able to convert users or provide an experience that it's extremely easy the disposal pen is the way to go because there's just no it's it's basically a proof there's no way to mess this up there's no way to not recharge it correctly or not fill it correctly so that is the entire C cell lineup let's drill down into each of these products individually so that you can learn a little bit more about the finishing and custom branding options available [Music] you", "kpuNQ7dupJ0": "how's it going guys and welcome to another video in this video I'm working on a Ford Ranger it is a 2007 model the engine is a 3 liter diesel model and it has a long cranking when cold and engine management light on fault so what I'm doing here is I'm just doing an initial test drive and looking at some of the live data I have already pulled the fault code on it and it is a p0 191 that fault code is a fuel oil pressure sensor range / performance problem so with that fall code we know that it is a wiring or a sensor issue so I'm just want to get this back to the workshop now and start to do some tests to diagnose default on this particular vehicle [Music] [Music] so the first thing I want to do is remove the top cover that's how little by two Tim Mills I take off that plastic cover and that gives me access to the rail and the sensor I then go about and I disconnect the sensor is just a simple push down and pull back clip I have a look at the connectors and see if there's any corrosion or any issues there and I have a look at the back at the wiring you see if there's anything no spell on that I didn't get my power probe I changed the connector on the top of that i hook it up to the battery that's in the vehicle always make sure that the voltage is strong enough in your battery before you start carrying out tests expected results we see here is I need to go to earth on the supply side it's going to be a higher voltage with these sensor disconnected in less than five volts and then lastly a constant 5 volt supply from the ECU so I have all of those with the ignition on of course so I can go about reconnecting the sensor at the rail and then I'm going to back pro so I disconnect the power probe so it doesn't use up any more power I do have to remove bit of wiring out of the way as I set up the back probes went back probing just make sure that you have a good solid connection on each one of those so the color coding on the back probes the blue is the earth the yellow is the signal voltage and the green will be the 5 volts I'm looking for so I just move the loom a little bit out of the way just there I remove one of the connectors because I don't have any right angle back probes to use if you had a right-hander back probe it'll be a little bit easier than what I have here but I reconnect to backup and the two checks I'm going to do is with the ignition on I'm going to just recheck the results that I had the floor and then I'm not actually gonna check the signal voltage with the vehicle running so at idle you would expect to see a low voltage somewhere in the 1.1 to 1.2 and then as it revs as it increases that signal voltage will increase the higher the Reds the higher the voltage so you can see it's 4.9 on the green probe the signal is 1.1 and idle and then as you rev it up and it's just around 2000 it gets 2 and it goes up to its highest point at 1.9 so what I do if we have the correct readings and over these certain Rev ranges we also have if you get up to around two and a half to two 8,000 in rpm you would expect to see about 2.5 in the voltage I have now confirmed that the fuel real pressure sensor is faulty and needs replacing the wiring is all good all the signals that's coming down from the ECU are correct so I go ahead and I order the pressure sensor now the fact that I have a bit of background knowledge of forward Rangers and also for transits 3-liter and 2.5 liter engines I decide to do a bit further investigating on this to make sure that future wise there will be no problems there is a banjo bolt on the pump of these that has a little mesh type strainer I worked on a 2.5 Ranger before and I found that that was getting partially clogged from bad fuel that he was getting in in different service stations I decided to remove that it's always a good idea when you're doing fuel related problems to make sure that you have a good fuel filter and a good fuel supply so I decide that I remove that banjo bolt I'm gonna clean it out completely if there's any dirtiness it's very simple 17 ml to remove it has two washers on it one on the inside and one on the outside so make sure that when you're removing that you have both washers when you're refitting I blow it out with the airlines I give it a good inspection and I reinstall it I also checked the history on this particular vehicle and it hadn't had a fuel filter in quite a long time so I go ahead and order a fuel filter as well and fit that now that we have all of them items don't while we wait for the fuel rail pressure sensor to come if we now sit back that fuel pressure sensor always remember when working on high pressure systems like this that you want the vehicle for test to be completely cold as well and also that when you're removing the fuel pressure sensor that the pressure has completely drained off in the rear if you don't have a scan or something like that where you can have a good information on what the pressure in the rail is then just leave the vehicle for a very long period of time until it's nice and cold that way you know the pressure would have drained off in the system I didn't get the new sensor out of the bag and what I'm going to do is compare it with the old sensor I just look at the shreddy type I look at the length of the top of it and I also checked the connector on itself now the connector on the old ones a little bit longer but the pin position and clip was all the same I didn't put it back into the rail thread it back in and I get my 27 ml spanner and I tightened that back up reconnected I put on the top cover and I cycle the key a number of times to help get the pressure back in the rail for starting and then it is road-test now the fuel filter and the banjo ball were just tips that I had come across and other Ford engines previously if you have a 2.5 Ford Ranger especially I would highly recommend doing that and checking it while you're in there the fuel filter also hadn't been replaced in a very long time so was highly recommended to do with all the tests that have been done I now know that this vehicle is going to be correct and I'm very happy to give it back to the customer I hope you found this video useful if you did please like share comment and subscribe and I hope to see you in the next one thanks for watching [Music]", "XpPcxBCZcRg": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick bringing you guys another nice new product that we dropped a little

the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "NUReVtaH34c": "26b Dakota here and today we're working on this ol five Mazda 3 that I've worked on on a couple of occasions so today we're doing the passenger side front wheel bearing now the reason that I'm doing this wheel bearing is because the wheel is loosen we'll look at that in a second so stuff you're going to need obviously you're going to need a new wheel bearing which I don't have it's at the part store right now and yeah if your hubs in bad shape you might as well just get the bearing and hub combo while you're at it um so this one I'm not really sure what tools were going to need I guess we're just gonna go at it as we go along um yeah pretty much so let's get started this isn't a super difficult job it only builds two hours so but the only thing is that you have to be able to take the knuckle out and take it to a shop have the bearing presto so make sure you find yourself a good shop that's not going to hose you when you take it to the taken to them because I had about four different shops want to charge me one hours labor which this is a 20 minute job to have it pressed out but since I don't have a press I'm kind of at their mercy so I found a place that would charge me straight time not screw me around on anything so find a good place like that and I kind of want to plug them believe it or not they're called Ladner motors or really nice people so yeah they definitely deserve a plug for that alright so let's get started shall we alright so the first thing is how do we know that the wheel bearings bad well is underneath it the other day and you can see quite a bit of looseness here so how do we know that this isn't a ball joint well a ball joint would be loose in this direction but it wouldn't be loose in this direction also the noise that it's making is kind of making a bit of a rubbing noise when you turn so that's a pretty good characteristic that we got a bad wheel bearing here so first thing we're going to do is we're going to get the wheel off of course I get the wrong socket this is a 21 millimeter socket job then just give it a good hit and it should come right off grab the lug nut I dropped them behind there looks like we got an issue with something in here because as you can see for the tire wear here that's some pretty serious wear on the inside here these tires are shot just get new ones as soon as she possibly can which should be upcoming pretty soon all right now the next step we need to get the caliper off nice thing I like about these this is our agent big letters so this is a little bit different style where we got a bolt that holds the seat shaft in which hopefully isn't as stubborn as the nuts are alright so start with a little pocket screwdriver there's two caps in here pop those off go now once those are off we complete a hex bit of some sort in this case it's a seven millimeter so actually a pretty common size for break splitting so like a never break job loosen the one then loosen the other both are loosened you can start unbolting the sliders and pulling them out let me just go ahead and serve us up the break so I'm at it chews complaint as they were making okay so now we're going to take our little pocket there the popper little caliper anti-vibration clip off take our caliper off instead of silver say for it won't fall so now that now while we have access to it there's an EVs connector up here we're going to pull that off if we'll come on ouch now we got to be very very careful we don't damage that sensor so I take the outer brake pad off as you can see she's got quite I'm gonna meet on it okay so now we've lost remove passed over way too big the caliper mount which is a 17 millimeter bolt loosen both and then remove it's a pretty tiny little bolt looks like 13 million loose that guy off I was actually fairly easy using a real here we go exercise nicely so we're in good shape there we got to be careful cuz there's the ABS sensor in there so go down here that holds the okay so there's a little clip right here on top of the tie rod that holds it that prevents it from falling out so save that that's very important we can drink bar not sure what it is it's like a 14 millimeter it's really seems like a lock nut yeah it is I wonder it's hard to get that done it's actually awfully hot the socket friction here Street a little bit heat so now the question is how do we get out the tie rod well what we do is we take it take the hammer and hit the ear where it goes through and it comes right out now the other thing is double check that this tie rod is okay you're in here anyway so if it's bad we'll replace it okay so we have our shaft loose now right in the back here there's a big bolt that holds the struggle it's going to be a biggie that is a 17 millimeter frankly I'm regretting not leaving the tire out on right it's pretty tight very last thing that knock boots is the ball joint and that again is a 14 millimeter it's a through bolt style so once you got the head of the bolt leveled with the thread half of course it's not going to come out because it's stubborn cheater bar you all right so I didn't film this next part because it was being real stubborn but what you need to do is once you get the ball joint pinched pull out you need to stick a chisel or something and Hammer it in between this part here at the lower ball joint then you can slide it up and I'll come right out and then you need to do then what you need to do is you need to pull the knuckle out so you can get the CV axle out and then what you do is you need to hammer your chisel in between this big guy and hammer on this edge of the steering knuckle here so it comes out of the strut now we're done that we can go to the shop and have this knuckle pressed oh so you see it's it's pretty loose in there so we're getting a new one all right so so I put the damn bearing back in or the whole knuckle so you can see it's pretty notch II and it's pretty loose so unfortunately I had to get a whole new hub assembly because that's the only way they come so I guess first things first we're going to start with I've been kind of cleanin up everything here but this isn't really gonna be too easy they don't like these things don't like to go back together so first I'm going to start with this little anti-seize on the area where the strut goes in and put a dab of anti-seize on the ball joint where the pinch bolt goes through now one thing that they told me is Mazda has a TSB on these things too where you should use some retaining compound and what that will do is that will prevent the that should prevent me the bearing for blocking out because there's actually nothing that holds the bearing in place it's just been a really rough day for me over so I just want to get this job done cabin for the weekend okay first thing we're going to do is we're going to slip the CD shaft into the or we can start with them but I guess we can start with not gold but nothing comes easy on this car ever so what you may have to do is you may have to wedge your chisel in there again too far this is cast-iron now if you kind of put it where the bolt is supposed to go to wedge it apart far enough to where you can just slide it in some nice nothing comes easy on this carve like I said so you want to get it the point where get the bolt through now what we need to do is guide the CD axle into place ah this whole job is one massive wrestling act if you like wrestling good for you you got yourself a wrestling match okay so now for the tricky part you have to push down on the god of this thing doesn't fit I'm so angry there we go slide CV shaft in can I got a cup here we go push it back there we go so we just need to get the ball turning up to the point where the pinch bolt can go through so that looks pretty good now wherever I put the damn pinch book so first things first we're going to put the strut mount back in and now I don't recall correctly I believe this one is 17 mill well just get it snug you don't have to or just loosely in there for right now you don't have to get everything great and tight now what we're going to do is we're going to put a little anti-seize on the body of this bolt this is the ball joint pinch bolt looks like this this one's easier to get back in that is to get out because you're not hammering on the threads I'm just giving this bath of the stuff now it doesn't look like we're quite there yet the nice thing versus the one I get on the PT Cruiser is this one actually looks like the groove goes oh here we go that's a little bit better a nice gush of anti-seize everywhere when I drove it home but whatever milk here I just want get this job done um a little messy never hurt put the bolt there the nut back line now this one I believe is 14 mil I believe is going to ratchet over by the Harris horse the bolt is spinning it can never make it easy this very is probably like the worst design I've ever seen since you have to you basically have to put pressure on the balls in order to get it so they're actually back in so just make sure if you're doing this job and all the pressing and stuff yourself he's some kind of retaining compound or some kind of lock tight in the bearing because there's actually no seat clip or anything like most most manufactures use a clip that hold the bearing but this one does not here we go alright so now we need to finish tightening the strut so it goes together a lot easier and it comes apart that's for sure now substituting for this bolt this is a very high strength it supports weight on the front suspension so make sure that one's good and tight so now the two choices there's no real exact way to put this thing back together but so now in our bearing kit we have the right bolt as well this is the CV axle retaining bolt unlike most vehicles that use that nut this one actually uses a bolt seems kind of odd but whatever I'm not going to question the engineers anymore because this is a pretty designed to begin with everything on this car fighting for it's just getting frustrated so we're gonna get this one nice and tight there we go you don't know if that one I'm too hard because that's not a very big bolt so now I put the tire on this again is your nut with a 14 millimeter head probably somewhere there it is jerk of the tie rod is to keep it supported so that the taper it's jammed into the taper gets jammed down into there of course it's not working all right well plan B C or D in now hurry for redneck engineering a pair of Fox scripts that are holding this high rod into the steering knuckle what's papi there we go so that's all the way in there's a teeny little clip there we go and that's that now we need to plug in the ABS sensor now if you're pressing this out yourself be careful lunge if you're pressing this out yourself you're probably not going to be watching this video all right so all we have we need to put the brakes back on probably worth it to put a little bit of a nice ease in on the rotor hat here and a little on the backs of these I'm going to put a dab of it on each of the studs these are brand new everything on this hub is brand new but be be warned that it's um these things are fairly crazy now take our kelp mounting bracket oh great these two bolts are 17 millimeter I think they're 17 looks ball right don't be afraid to give these ones the beans here we give the pads a little coating of a nice ease now outer pad goes in there and we can pull the caliper free from its little holder and this guy goes in double-check his go back to our seven millimeter oh here we go let's left just put these two caps back in see right there all right now put our severely wanna tire back on the wobble Nonna for a test-drive first thing make sure that the brakes work okay is took them off even though me you may not have worked but you didn't take them apart so it feels good personals Fran hear any noise that she's complaining just crap all in the trunk so he was rattling earrings from the trunk bring any traffic laws and doing this this is looking truck drivers feels okay it's got a really crappy tires on the front too so not everything's not surprised are making a bit of a noise but I do not hear nor do I feel the rubbing noise that she was talking about cars often frustrating to work on Italian car feels good though try as well that bearings pretty toast just gritty and loose and worn out is definitely the end of his life she was complaining of the rubbing noise and turning right Road wise coming from the tires is real obnoxious they're old leathercraft and she said she's getting new ones in a couple of weeks so I think we're okay with that I love this little car I love to drive it man pain in the ass to get parts words I got to tell you it's there's stuff that's based on built date stuff like that so around the smaller motor she's getting quite a bit of path she's my child too I like this car I love driving it but frankly working on it's a real pain in the ass same thing with rear brakes too different style pads for two different models filled dates is just it just pisses me off this cars been nothing but a royal pain in my side all right grow them that door panel rattles sum it up this is not a fun job but you just got to get the right parts that's the main thing make sure you get the correct parts because if not you're going to have a real fun time this case the hub and the bearing are one big chunk so you can't replace either separately you got to replace it all at once which makes it bearing triple the price so now I get to tell a customer this and she's gonna be thrilled but just be careful when you buy stuff for this car make sure that you give them the VIN and the build date and all that other stuff that's very very important anyway I got to go I got a lot of stuff to do so hope you enjoyed this and enjoy laughing at my misfortunes follow me on facebook at facebook.com/ slash 6b dakota twitter at 6b dakota Google+ plus 6b Dakota and always here on

V Rajesh signing off bye", "BSbcjE90b8Q": "[Music] hi guys i'm dan huff CEO of honey stick bringing you guys our latest and greatest to the 2019 product edition which is our honey stick 510 thread twist battery that's a push-button now i've been in touch with a lot of you guys through the youtube channel and through social media and everybody wants honey stick to make just a simple battery and they want a simple battery that's quality that's powerful and on a bargain and that is exactly what this battery is I'm bringing this battery to you guys as a honey stick with the honey stick warranty and the traditional honey stick quality for 15 dollars at retail now what does this battery entail it's a twist battery so you get to dial in on your voltage by twisting the bottom this is a high quality twist battery not one of those Alibaba twist batteries where the twister falls off or the button falls through the unit where the unit feels like it's a pencil and it's not a real nice solid metal pen this is a quality battery that you're going to get this rechargeable that has high capacity high powers going to dial into the cartridges there's exactly that it is the best starter battery that you can get your hands on that has no basic extra in order to save you guys money most people they open it up from the little cardboard box and they throw it away that's why to make the cost even cheaper this isn't going to come in a cardboard box it's just gonna come as you see it bubble wrapped and shipped to you guys and this is gonna be a web-only product so we can get more people started on honey stick with the basics now let's run through some of the specs here now this battery operates with adjustable twist voltage as I mentioned before and we'll do a close-up here freeze shortly it adjusts all the way from the low end of two volts all the way up to four volts and you can adjust it incrementally by twisting the dial so you can really hone in exactly where you want your cartridge vaping intensity level to be now a lot of people also said with these variable voltage batteries that they wanted something simpler they don't want to keep track of five clicks on five clicks off three clicks to cycle through which color indicates which temperature and preheat they were just getting clicked out so this one as long as the batteries on turn it dial it over to your voltage leave it there push the power to be on and we'll walk through the different functionalities of this battery now all you have to do with this thing is you have to make sure that you keep it charged and keep the connectors clean in case you get a leaky cartridge but let's bring it up close and go over these batteries all right so these batteries are gonna come in two colors you have a stainless steel nice brushed finish with a black honey stick insignia logo and you also have a real nice high quality matte black with the classic yellow honey stick logo on now these batteries are gonna be pushed button as you can see they're 500 mAh so they're they're a nice size battery they aren't you know very long if as you can see here compared to one of our bee boxes it's probably about an inch and a half longer than a bee box which is a real nano sized battery so the charger unscrews you can plug this in to I recommend using a wall adapter refrain from using an apple wall adapter but use your BlackBerry Samsung Android whatever chargers you have and it has a charging indicator light on here now when you get at the average charge time for these things as a couple hours depending on how full of a charge it came on generally comes on 30% charge so I recommend charge it when you get it but you do have a little life when you turn it on now let's walk through how to operate this battery now it's got a real high quality button as you can hear that click it's got a good spring action that's so you get a good life on your button and it prevents it from getting stuck so all you're gonna do is you're clicking five times on five times repeatedly to turn off and now because this battery has a strong spring in it you gotta click it decisively so don't just did it to do it you know click it five times you see it just blinked up right there that means that the battery is on and once the battery is on while it is on you can dial in your twist now how do you dial in your twist you're gonna see if we get really really close here I want everybody else II the little notch that you have there it looks like a little indentation like if you took a little little little stamp and stamped a little hole right at the bottom of the silver trim twist piece there now you can see it that aligns with the voltage here it's on the minimum which is 2 volts now what you do is you twist that and as it aligns with different voltages that's the amount of volts and intensity that you give your battery now the higher you are like if you go to 4 which is all the way up the more intensity you're gonna have the more vapor the more battery power you're gonna use the higher temperatures gonna vape at and also the faster it's gonna you know run down your battery power now this is a 500 milliamp hour battery so it is more powerful a lot of the batteries on the market a lot of them are to 80s and 350 s so you are gonna get good usage in between charges on this battery now the only other feature that this has is it has a preheat function in case if you need it now with a twist battery you can run the voltage so low that you don't necessarily need to use a preheat function but it's there in case you want to and what you do is when the battery is on use click it two times repeatedly and then you see it turns red and stays there it's running through a preheat it changes colors the preheat is a maximum 15 seconds if you push the button while it's doing preheat it will exit prema so you can do that and then to turn the battery off 1 2 3 4 5 and it blinks and it is off so this battery is good to transport really easy to screw the charger back in here and to load a cartridge you can use a multitude of 510 thread cartridges to take the magnet after off of this one you simply screw it on you feel real nice high quality spring pin connector there it's going to make contact with the cartridge and it lines up nicely a lot of the twist markets they have like a little skirt or a little bullet and over there so they don't line up perfectly this is a nice flat battery you can carry it transports lightweight and powerful okay so guys for the best and most powerful bargains stick twist

remove this panel by using the end of this emergency key and then just want to pull out the panel with these I'm going to use the emergency key just lie it inside find the pattern and twist once you twisted it you will hear a small click in the seat that will then allow you to open a seat and locate the toolkit inside the seat you'll have your toolkit where you will need to locate your emergency connector with the screwdriver which is also located a new toolkit you will need to remove the panel here on the floor board [Applause] you wanna locate these two cables and you wanna remove the tape take the cap off of this socket just by using this little lever right there grab your emergency connector and then fit it to the bike you will then see the brute light go on using the serial numbers on this key tab insert them into the ignition switch wait for the blink type in the number so if it's a zero leave it alone that will be a six wait for the other one type in the next number which is

different models", "SE6hKl4plsQ": "[Music] so let's take a closer look here at the th2 cartridge which we refer to internally as the c2 cartridge now it's available in two different sizes 1/2 gram size as well as a 1 gram size and then a number of different tips the most common tip being a white ceramic tip lesser known as the black ceramic tip also available on there's even a brown ceramic tip available not shown here over on the metallic side of things we have a metal chrome tip that's available as well as a gold tip along with an entire gold body that's available and you can use these in any combination you want so if you wanted to have a gold body with a black ceramic tip you can do that if you wanted to have a chrome body with a gold tip you can do that so again there's any sort of combination that you can think of of these different size of colors and tips you can do and as for branding and logo options you can place a logo to color logo anywhere here on the glass cartridge body as well as painted on the band here at the bottom or you can get laser etching on the bottom now when it comes to the tips you can if you have the metal tips here either the gold or the chrome you can laser etch a logo into these tips however that is not available for the ceramic tips we sometimes get questions as to whether or not we can print a logo on the ceramic tips and we always suggest no because it is not safe to ingest the paints that some of these logos are painted with so you don't want to put them on the tip where our users lips will be touching it so that basically rounds out the available options with the th two glass cartridge [Music] Oh", "qC9kjfAu2MU": "hey guys it's Nick with blue farms here just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "faMjXNIJKpE": "hey guys welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to be doing a full comprehensive review and comparison of both the pax era battery and the Jupiter tomcee cell battery so why these two batteries you may ask in Arizona the PAX battery is monopolized by one concentrate company that currently fells its cartridges in California I know there are a whole bunch of different growers that have packs cartridges available but here in the state of Arizona we only have direct concentrates if you've seen my previous video on the pax era and drip concentrates I absolutely love this pen this vaporizer it is so amazing I swear by it i raved about it whatever drip also offers a csail cartridge basically seaso makes the pod the cartridge that drip puts the oil into and they also make jupiter and cecil also make the battery same thing with the pack system pax makes the pod and the battery and drip just puts the oil in the pot which i actually think it's kind of smart because then these oil companies don't have to like learn how to make these things it's already available to them it kind of just like speeds up the process the PAX courage comes in only 500 milligrams the C cell cartridge comes in 500 milligrams and a thousand milligrams so you have two different options there's also a lot more deals in the valley on the C cell cartridges so I decided one day to try these one there was a deal going on at one of my local dispensaries I think it was true mad that I got this at but I'm not 100% positive that's the dispensary that distributes for drip so yeah I decided because that pax video did so well I would put it up against a competitor or its competitor in the state which is the palm battery both of these cartridges that I have by the way are starburst you can see it says it um yeah um this one has a good decent amount left and I didn't even realize this pod had anything left it's kind of just been like sitting around for good week this may be a quarter full and then I have my drip cartridge which is also pink starburst but there's really not that much left and I'm gonna get into that later cuz it has to do with my opinions on both of these vaporizers on how long the cartridge lasts does it burn what does it taste like whatever so to get started I'm just gonna do a quick refresher on the PAX era which if you haven't seen my video if you want to see like a whole review where I teach you how to use the app that it comes with all that stuff you can that you can check out the video that I did that will be linked in the description box below so the PAX era according to pax papers website is an effortless pen and pod system for cannabis oil control temperature flavor and potency and achieve session predictability experience the new era of cannabis enjoyment this is offered in one color of black and it is $29.99 on Cox's website when you open the box you get this obviously mine is engraved because I got it done one of their promotional events but so yours won't look like this it'll just be plain black I got the sticker out and you get a sticker I just like when companies give you a sticker like the drip packs pods in every single box pretty much every single box there's a sticker and it's like a crackerjack prize I don't know maybe I'm just like a child but I love that so the pack Sarah is fully controllable from an app on my phone I usually like to keep my I hope this is charged my battery this is daddy on we have the poem seesaw battery this comes in a whole bunch of different colors it comes in black pink gray green and blue I think HS black gray blue and pink so I obviously got pink seen this retail from anywhere from like $20 to $30 so it's gonna be about the same price as the packs battery maybe even a little bit cheaper if you can find it and the palm battery according to the box has aluminum alloy housing inhale activated stealthy breathing LED indicator quality circuit board with multiple protection battery capacity 550 m a magnetic adapter included micro USB rechargeable I reminded me of something super different about the palm battery this is what comes in the package it is your clear battery that fits in the palm of your hand obviously I put that sticker here comes with a charger alright well this one says C cell and the PAX one says PAX 2 so like I couldn't tell the difference even though they're the same microUSB and what's different about the palm is it comes with these two little rings that you actually need in order to use any cartridge with the battery in order for it to be compatible it's a magnetic system so these are magnetic adapters that you screw on to the end of your cartridge there's two one four I'm assuming a 500 milligram cartridge and one for a thousand so I just screwed the 500 milligram adapter onto the bottom of my cartridge like so and it's magnetic into the battery Oh before I try that for you on camera I'm just gonna read you a little bit about this battery the C cell cartridge in general and whatever from Jupiter researchers website an ordinary atomizer the coil resides on the surface of the wick causing inconsistent heating additionally ordinary with designs cause reduce flow to the heating coil unrivaled vapor performance for premium extracts embedding the heating coil 360 degrees within the ceramic core ensures the atomizer is uniformly heated they being reinvented for extracts baking has evolved significantly since the first east cigarette hit the US market in 2007 Jupiter knew from the start that plant extracts require hardware designed specifically for their high viscosity to address this need Jupiter started with the knowledge gaining produce the best available e cigarette technology on the planet and turn to C cell technology we are proud to sell the best performance driven hardware on the market and stand behind our liquid performance of products now other technology comes close to matching C sales performance discover the exclusive seats a difference with Jupiter research so clearly this product is marketed to be a discreet kind of mimic of a cigarette and it produces a big vape cloud similar to that of an e-cigarette witch or a vape which is really great if you're looking for that if you're looking for that effect and also I read somewhere I don't remember where but the temperature adjusts itself accordingly based on the cartridges needs so I'm assuming when it's at the bottom and it needs to burn at a higher temperature the battery will adjust itself but that being said I have no control over how hot this cartridge burns and I tend to use these pods a 500 milligram cartridge a lot quicker than I would a normal PAX 1 because with that device I have control the cartridge burns slower at a lower heat obviously and with this system I have no control so typically the drip cartridge the C cell cartridge would last me about two days where I could make the tax era pod last five or six if I try hard enough and if I like set the teeth the heat at the correct setting it'll last me like anywhere from five days to a week so that's a really big that's a really big difference between the system and the other system so at Tru med the dispensary that distributes for drip concentrates a drip cartridge for a C cell batteries for 1,000 milligrams it is $65 and for 500 milligrams it is $40 and the pax era pod will run you $45 for the 500 milligram they should really make a thousand but maybe there's a reason they don't I don't know oh we're just gonna wait for the packs to charge so I can do a comparison of like how much vapor you get with this with that so now that this is charged I'm gonna just compare at the level of vapor that I get from both of these it's the same strain I don't know what this heat setting is so I'm actually gonna pause really quick and go check because it's on my phone and I'm going to need to use that but I'm gonna let you know what temperature this pen is set at I don't know what this is up but it's self adjusts so I guess we'll see the comparison to the heat setting that I usually like to use and then what this pen gives out my pack Sarah is currently set up five hundred and sixty degrees will see the difference between the vapor and this is not really like a good judge because like there's not much left in this cartridge but it's cuz I used it so quick okay so consensus they give a really similar hit this is designed to give you a bigger hit like a vape but I honestly think that these are really really similar in the hit this cartridge started to taste really bad kind of like marshmallow II like battery when I got to the bottom and this still tastes amazing even though the liquid is like really dark and usually gonna liquid Stark it means like the it's gone bad and it tastes really bad but that actually tasted so good for being really old and disgusting and maybe that's because I've been having this marshmallow cartridge here but I do have a pom battery I would definitely say that it's worth it because you can use a whole bunch of different concentrate companies a whole bunch of different growers offer see sell cartridges in Arizona but I actually really like drip concentrates so I think I might be sticking to this cartridge it's a little bit more expensive or 500 milligrams like five dollars more but I think it's worth it I think the pax cartridge lasts way longer and the jupiter-c sell cartridge did so thank you guys so

magic 710 battery and it's great little battery it's got a 380 mAh capacity it's tiny it's like a little mini version of the silo it has great airflow the other thing I like about it it has this little red light here so when you're hitting it you can see that it's getting activated uses a magnetic connector and as their magnetic connector looks a little bit different it doesn't have the same airflow holes but it works great and I was hitting this before in a routes cart now I'm hitting it on a one I filled myself and transferring makes this battery but you might see it under different

Schneider and his granddaughter ooh we drove to charisma or secondhand furniture store we identified ourselves and asked to look at his buy book under the date of July 27th bhisma had recorded the purchase of more than three dozen articles of furniture from a house on College Avenue the address was that of the Snider's man and a woman Sajid they said they sold their house and their going east man said the company worked for it transferred him to Boston told me had to get back to techo his new job would you recognize the people if you saw him again bridgnorth sure I think showroom was a great talker she said they figured on selling the stuff piece by piece they'd get more but since they had to leave town the next day she decided to sell a whole lot to a dealer you got the furniture for a pretty low price didn't sit pretty good price yeah that's why I went along in the Fast deal wasn't gonna talk myself out of a bargain they want to sell fast I want to buy I don't think anything was wrong sergeant yeah Mrs Mary how long her dining room set that's it right over there you surely say cigar burn on tap just above one of the legs you know it anyway it seems to me that time I had in the table I look really sure stuck me all right that's the last best deal I ever me how did they contact see Chris Moore what kind of approach to do you call me on the phone when I came out and gave him an appraisal and the stuff nothing suspicious about either the man or the woman that's how she was in the house dressed bandana round a head the guy was in old clothes just as home as you please look like he was doing a little repair work around the house you know mm-hmm you notice if they had a car part for the house matter of fact I didn't it wasn't any in the driveway mmm-hmm no argument over the price you offered him for the floor you know I seem to hesitate a little bit they took my first offer I thought I had a good deal no I did react after you agreed on a price in a hurry you said they had to board a train that night to Boston they asked me to get the furniture right away mm-hmm the woman said they had other business to wind up so if they weren't at the house when I came back with the van why she leave the back door open for me I guess you realize it was an answer place to hold on this furniture at your bar I had no one in blame but myself you gave this man and woman a check for the full amount of the sale is that right Christmas five hundred and fifty dollars down the drain you have the canceled check no not yet if you like you can probably get it from the bank don't imagine those crooks would waste any time cashing home we'd appreciate it if you'd run down the bank with us now new location sergeant could I speak with mr. gresner hello mrs. Knight and mr. Chrisman are you sure I'm sorry about all this I didn't know I understand sir you buy furniture don't you yes sir what could you give me for two army surplus cots there's more meat arranged mr. Atif mr. Snyder's furniture and ship it back to his home then we took him down to his bank where he recovered the canceled check for five hundred and fifty dollars endorsement read mr. Thomas Butterworth according to the bank teller who waited on them the suspects had cashed the check shortly after the sale of the Snyder's furniture from the second-hand dealer and the clerk at the bank we got a complete description of the man and woman known as Mr and Mrs Butterworth we also had photostatic copies made of the check and specimens of the handwriting from the endorsement from the descriptions we checked the suspects through the stats office we got nowhere during the next two weeks we found six more second-hand dealers who had been taken in on the same furniture deal the description of the man and woman matched and so did the handwriting in the endorsements on its check was only one variation the couple went under a different name on each occasion Wednesday August 26 9:00 a.m. like this today that right that's it captain got the description mo handwriting still cane reaching speeds have been free willing for a month now what's gonna take a stoppin when Ben came up with a pretty good idea this morning we'd like to talk it over with you know what's that kind of a system with decoy skipper we were thinking might be a good idea to contact all the division captains and have them ask their men if they have any neighbors going on vacation you're on go ahead well we've got a few dozen houses spotted around the city we could plant a few things make them look obviously vacant we keep the houses covered at all times they'll make pretty good bake for those fees mm-hmm how would you send them really should make arrangements to get a key to each home keep the mill from favored deliveries coming let them pile up on the doorstep they could reimburse the whatever God we're not making any headway we could run this for a couple of weeks see what happens mm-hmm what do you think try it 9:30 a.m. we contacted all division commanders and pressing them to ask their man to contact burglary detail if they know of any of their neighbors about to leave on a vacation during the next two days the response came in and the plan went into effect 40 homes throughout the city were spotted his decoys they were kept under surveillance at all times in the week that followed two more burglaries of the same type were reported but the suspects failed with drying of the decoy homes the man in the pawn shop and secondhand details continued to work right along with us the stolen furniture kept turning up but not the thief again the homes that had been broken into displayed all the usual signs that the occupants were away old circulars and newspapers scattered on the lawn milk bottles lined up at the door all the blinds drawn the decoy plan continued no results August 31st we had a report of another burglary involving the theft of furniture we made our investigation 2:00 p.m. we went back to the office to get out a list of stolen articles hi man hi Austin when'd you get back from your honeymoon late last night sit down man I'd sure like

and charger and a few ways to prolong the life of your equipment first let's go over how to keep your battery clean on occasion a tiny bit of oil may drip down onto the center contact point of your battery causing it to stick to the charger possibly ripping out the internals of either your battery or charger when you disconnect it the best way to clean your battery and charger is to wipe it clean with a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol be careful not to put too much pressure on the contact point because you can push it down into the battery now let's go over connection problems and how to fix them by adjusting the center contact point one issue is the battery not charging when you connect a battery to a charger you should see the bottom of the battery blink a few times and then the charger light should turn from green to red if you connect your battery and it doesn't blink or the light on the charger doesn't turn red then you most likely have a contact point that needs to be raised you may also encounter this problem when trying to use a cartridge or a heating chamber and it doesn't work always check your contact point when any of these problems occur now let's go over fixing the contact point here I suggest using a small pair of tweezers but any skinny object like a paperclip or hair pin will work just fine what you want to do here is very gently wedge up the center point of the battery from each side till you feel you've raised it just enough to make contact you want to be careful not to use too much force because you can rip out the contact point and possibly ruin the battery we hope this video was helpful make sure to check out all our videos for more tips on other Atmos products", "08GFsXO6yXw": "[Music] hi everyone how's it going welcome back

2001 with the one point seven liter engine we had a p1 361 check engine code and the car in intermittently basically died on the freeway so after looking on all data identify problems that could have happened we could have too much in play in the camshaft or it could be the top dead center cam position sensor circuit wiring or the sensor itself the wiring is is loomed and really tight with everything and via so we're going to look at that last if we're going to throw a campus ition sensor in here and change the valve cover gasket and check the camshaft and play first thing we're going to do is disconnect the negative cable to the battery it could be cool if I can fit my socket on that's it take that off and set it aside go ahead and get this little plastic cover on the legs use a key turn these that way leave it to the side then we're going to want to remove this whole sub assembly here I'm just going to start loosening everything up a little bit including all this alright alright so now that we have all the bolts undone we're just going to remove the coolant temp sensor as well I'm just going to push down on the little tab here and pull up the throttle position the throttle cables out of the way oh my loosen the hose for the for the AC unit just so I could get the wiring loom out of the way and we're going to check that's all alright we need to remove this hose as well - all right I'm just going to pry off on a little tab there that's good you can let that hang out of the way I might want to remove the air box too so we're probably just gonna get that other way as well all right now that we got the intake off and out of the way just you don't really need to do it just kind of clears up some room you just want to kind of pull this off of the studs and then we can start on building to the valve cover I believe is with some 10 ml years and we'll just kind of loosen them up can come a little cross better you don't want to warp this at all we'll start taking it off and we also have to remove this throttle cable plate that sits directly underneath this it's just two little things I'd like to do is like to take a mallet and I've already loosened this and just kind of whack the side of the valve cover just to kind of loosen it up and then on any high side of a valve cover so the side that's the highest point I like to kind of take a screwdriver and just maybe just barely touch the tip of it like a brass screwdriver something that's not going to damage the metal surface and then we'll be able to pull this in maneuver it just out of the way there we go actually looks pretty clean not bad and I set this upside down on the ground don't want to get that contaminated at all and so now we have our upper timing cover that consists of three bolts to pull the upper cover off and this is the b2 check the top dead center sensor for this one you're going to need a pretty tight little 10 millimeter wrench it's kind of fitting here in the belt of course there are videos all you guys at home like we're going and then we got the lower line block cipher bluffing the king you know at the three bolts are off you should be able to remove the connector for the top did Center sensory you should really just pull out of the way take a little leave rate course so we got the sensor in there going to be hard to see that's the sensor right there we're going to stick some rags underneath in the timing cover so when we loosen that bolt it doesn't go flying everywhere because if that bolt comes out without us around it I'm gonna have to pull the lower katana cover off to find it alright so we have a rag shoved underneath so now if the bolt Falls hopefully it gets caught in the rag we're gonna try and loosen this easily as we can and hopefully it doesn't fall out it's cool they're getting a little tricky and ragas there all right I got the bolt out set that aside and I'm going to pull the sensor up and not much to it really all right so we got the new sensor pop it back in we're just going to take it but remember this is a plastic piece so you want to Snug it up give it a nice turn and that is about it let's get a wrench on there and snug it up okay so now we're sliding the cover back on and we're getting the three bolts back into place well trying to it's a very narrow area so you might want to try and get some small hands to help you out with this part of the job man it is tight in here and just snugging them up right now what one and then let's go ahead and plug this connector in make sure it's pushed all the way in and let's put the rubber grommet and push that back in as well to keep any dirt out of the timing cover now let's tighten up that third bolt down there let's snug them all down slow that one's tight now all right so that's nice and tight now we got to uh get that valve cover seated in there I'm going to take off all the old deposits and stuff with the rag and then we'll seat the new fella a series I'm just going to take all the old sediment I'm going to try and flush it out of the valve cover see it's me yucky gunk like that we just want to clean our mating surface up as best as we can so that we have a nice dry seal because it doesn't take much to ruin a good seal it only takes one bad spot so we'll get all this gunk out of the way and the top is going to be fairly clean because uh oil is not going to be traveling I'll pass the top it's going to come towards the bottom because it's a slanted cylinder head a little bit so clean that up like so and you can see here this valve covers been replaced before obviously I don't know if you'll be able to see that little Nick but someone had taken a screwdriver right there and pry it up right there you don't want to do that because that's on the slanted side of the block which is why I do it in the top corner yeah where there's a bunch of excess material or metal left over that isn't where the contact point is at a gasket so let's get that new gasket seated on the Gulf cover we definitely need to clean in size of cover gasket out there please all right so like I said we're just going to clean the inside out just as any loose particles it might have dropped in there while we were doing this so now with the new gasket we're going to try and apply you see they used a little bit of a looks like a silicone in some of the spots so we're going to go ahead and do the same thing term let's gasket just going to use some on the corners it's first place um just to keep everybody happy and this will just help them here a nice tight fit so again we're going to take this gasket we're going to I guess somewhat line it up with the gasket start in the corner once that's good let's give you a kid clean pass around let's get enough to get back on to me now what we want to do over here is we want to do the same thing we're going to want to apply some of this in these little hard to reach areas like over the cam humps here and in all the little corners so we'll take a little bit into my finger and I'm just going to spread it around the corner very small amount you don't need a lot of this stuff and you got the corners and now we're going to want to do a little bit at the base of the humps and I'm just gonna smear some over the top of the humps as well don't seat that gasket don't go crazy stuff you guys you just need a little bit we've got to clean some of that off the lifter cover there all right now they're all that fun work we can attempt to put that valve cover on hopefully this AC line works with us naked kind of get it on there without too much fuss would be nice okay so this AC line you come over as far as possible almost there check with gasket and give us the old mallet I'm gonna get my flashlight and go around and check alright let's go ahead and tighten this down a little bit snug it up was good to make sure that all the holes are lining up which they seem to be so that's good and I just start snugging them all up we've got to crush that gasket into place gasps it's gonna be fresh now yeah I'm not using too much force just making sure they all feel about the same thank you that gets crushed into place pretty nicely and put the oil filler cap back in dipstick after cleaning it off since we're here check that and we're going to clean this off so that we have any leaks well we'll be able to see so it's just a good practice I mean just to keep anything point you're going to tighten up our little break here that we kind of moved out of the way we're just going to Snug it down like so that's good now we'll get the throttle linkage bracket back into place and we'll go ahead and tighten that up as well right now the bullets the brackets bolted back on pull this cover back over here and get that all squared away let's get all fancy unit popped back in that's also with a this 10 millimeter here do this by hand there we go all right good place very nice let's move it up don't know why I have my cent on there and I ain't going anywhere now get these back in there and check the bottoms of them before you put them in to make sure that there's a if there's nothing block in there get it right there pump it back in and then we can start bolting these little pieces back into place type plus a little turn same with these remember you're taking on a plastic small now plug that coolant temp sensor back in let's in there please forget the whole thing let's get clothes off there we go that's more like it all right that's good there and let's get these two in here as well here's that get this little cover back on it sounded good click the in chick back on got that one back in so let's take this and take your attempt sensor get it plugged back in back in there down there as well let's get the intake back in there black box back on make sure the box is clean for you taken little bit not much in the plastic box you will crack it if you transport go around be like a little quarter-turn all right let's get the last three bolts technique here thank you just to hold the whole he take walks on those are tens all right that's good that's good okay we can go ahead and throw our negative cable back on the battery holding the wire side and through the 10 back although all right so that's back on I'm just going to double check to make sure everything is plugged back in or it should be we got the car started we're just going to check for any obvious signs of leaks anywhere under the take it for a drive we'll come back check for leaks and we'll see if the check engine light comes back on for the p1 361 top dead center intermittent intermittent sensor fault there's been another video from Anthony idea whatta tech please like my videos subscribe and do

"QmXTlctoSsw": "well I'm back got this transit to sort out today and if you can see Roy up there and then if there's like any good the clutch point went on me last night you can see a wetter this along there it's gone on that corner right there somewhere it's a base what I'm gonna do is just replace that it runs down all the way down here do you see my finger down there so I'm gonna pop it off there and then you follow the piper in the back it's the lower pipe of one of those it comes around and then it goes into there looks like this two little metal like retaining clips so I'm gonna pull those off and hopefully the Pope just pulls out and then it's the plan plan is to feed this pipe in I got it on eBay for about sixteen quid something other so yeah by the looks of it the clips holding those hot cups there right in there so get these clips out and hopefully it's just a push fitting and then work it everybody do I never done one of these before but yeah I won't video taking it out if there's any bits in there that I can video that I'll give you a hand make it easier for yourselves then I will video it but it's gonna be a tight one to try and video undo so I'll try and get this pipe out and then do a little update in a bit the both little clips are off now this is how they look just like though the pipes all back in there the clip down the bottom is pretty easy to get in they clip up the top part trying to show in the video it's all the way in there that one is a nightmare to get in I use some pliers and I come in from I'll show you with the players I'll come in from this angle Andreea right there lava and then I pop the clip back in that is fiddly fiddly as it's crazy to eat hand in there lands are not the smallest as you can see so I do struggle with things like this but it's done just need to bleed it now as far as I can see down here there's a bleed nipple right down there you can see my finger there like spaghetti junction with point work then we drop the phone down and I'll try and get closer right there hopefully you could see there that's the bleed nipple so need to crack that off and then get this bled out and hopefully I'll be good I'm repaired well it's all done and I'll blend it all up if you look down there I believe you can see that bit got the spanner on there and a pipe the spanner is 11 mil it's been actually quite a bit of a nightmare to bleed here what I did was loosen the bleed nipple and tried to bleed it lucky breaks it just wasn't happening so I left the bleed nipple open left the pipe on which runs down to this bookie and basically I just pulled the clutch up and down because it was flat to the floor kept doing that and just loads and loads of air was coming through the pipe I kept doing until it was a solid line of fluid for about a foot closed the nipple and then I'm back in the van and just kept pulling the clutch up and down and it seemed to pressurize and now that clutch is like perfect watch my show you know the clutch is back and it works I've test tested it and it's all good so that's how you fit the pipe and bleed the clutch it is fiddly and the little metal clips are a nightmare you just got to watch you don't lose them I suggest you get yourself one of these magnet things but the tools used whereas flat screwdriver 11 mil spanner I learned to pipe which I think's 8 mil yeah and that's it really so jobs don't it's not it's not difficult he's just fiddly but yeah I'll get all this put back together now get it all finished off and don't forget to replace a little rubber grommet on you bleed nipple just to keep any crap out of here but you'll see thanks for watching give video like and considering subscribing to the channel there's gonna be a lot more content next year car shows and fixing stuff stuff laughs so yeah uploading these slow at the moment just because it's winter lack of funds to do the Subaru and yeah it's just crappy weather so yeah no clouds were back to normal

the accessories and I'm also going to show you how to use it this is a driver CD this camera is plug and play so as far as just using it the video this driver is not necessary the driver is used for if you want to set it up as a webcam right here you see silicone case and this is a piece of hardware with the camera not a couple of pieces of hardware this is a goes around this loop in that loop and you put this around your neck that's what that's for and of course here's the camera itself as you can see it's it's quite small I'll show you how to use it now over here you have the power button so you push power you're going to see it light up on top now once the light goes on it's like some blue lights you see here this is the record button as soon as I press this you're going to see flashing red lights and that means we're going to be recording so let me push that and as you can see lots of flashing red we are not recording now to stop it all you have to do is press it again and you're going to see the red light flash about three times and it's going to stop flashing now it's stopped the clinic now over here you have a mode button this you use for voice activation micro SD card slot my micro SD is already inserted and is the reset of course to turn the camera off just push power and the camera will turn off this is your USB socket and you connect the USB cable here and the other side into the computer and this is the USB cable that it comes with so I'm going to show you how to attach some of these pieces of hardware top part on first like that then you clip the bottom on that hear that click see now it's nice and tight over here you have a clip so you can clip that onto a shirt or anything else that you can clip it on and the camera can focus in your court so that's one piece of hardware and now you have another piece over here that it comes with and you can do with this you can actually clip this onto the RC and this is a pivot it goes all the way around like that so you can catch this is actually two holes where you can probably put a couple of screws to attach it to something and this will pivot to get different angles of recording that just slides out right like that we can just take this off you just hold these two together like that and that just comes right off you have another piece of hardware over here that's going to basically latch on the same way just put that on like that that's it that's on and basically it's going to go like that so you could mount that onto something possibly as a dashboard cam you could put it on your dashboard of your car and have that focus and this pivots to get the right angle that you're looking to get and a couple of holes maybe screws there's maybe a few other ways that you can think of mounting it maybe possibly with some kind of adhesive or velcro or something like that so there's a few pieces of hardware that you get here which is helpful so you just take that off that pulls off that's basically it so stay tuned then I'm going to be giving the camera test going to be taking it out for a test and see how it goes in the ad it's a good idea right now cover this it's quite small seemed like anyone even though there you go schools you're free to like up the video the comments subscribe encouraged to me", "uHxRMg2xuNs": "hi guys my name is Sergey and I am a mechanic and outer repair shop in Pacifica today I gonna show you how to change clutch on this vehicle we have Honda CRV 2004 and this one is for oval drive car and it has stick shift transmission we're gonna change clutch guys are gonna take the transmission out and I will show you what you need to do first I will use a rock without rock it's almost impossible job but you can take the transmission design without rock on the floor but it will be really uncomfortable and not convenient guys but we're going to use a rack and first wheel we need to take the wheel off let's start it after we took the wheel off we need to we need to take battery out we need to get out of this air filter box to get more access to our transmission after who took filter air filter box out guys who have more access now we'll keep working on the top from the top we disconnect our cylinder slave cylinder it has still line it goes over the transmission we lose all our brackets and we just take it out and hang it around move it away I mean also we disconnect our cables and move them also away and after that we start loose all our bolts around the transmission which connect our transmission and engine block okay guys we disconnect the cables which go to the transmission and I took off the slave cylinder and also moved it away like this just remember do not push in a clutch because now it's free and you might broke the slave cylinder it might open and fell off this is why don't push on the clutch that you took it off next also guys take out connector from speed sensor and move it away like this and from the temperature sensor also and now we probably finished to take out everything from the top and we raise the car up and start working underneath to be able take out our subframe guys take this front plastic cover and we have more access and to our bolt mount bolt we have four bolts which hold all our frame and also have our Bolton connectors lose our ball joints and front and rear transmission mount also would take that balls from transmission mount and that's it and we drop this frame down we've got subframe down next next step we need to lose our drive shaft which goes to the rear and just one mount left side left on the transmission side and now engine and transmission now hang on this two month mounts one left and one right side we lose our drive shaft and we have to take our front drive shaft also front axles guys I always recommend to drain the oil from the transmission because when you take the axle out it might leak oil from the transmission and it might not but when you take it when you take it out you twist it turn it and it might you might spill the oil you might make mess this is why I just drain the oil and after that you will fill it back and it'll help you you'll work more comfortable you will not make mess let's take the CV axles and a rear shaft after that we need to take our starter because our starter mount to the transmission our time to take axles out guys front axle I took left side off and just bind with simple wire like this to the exhaust let it hanging and left side guys just use simple pry bar it has a clip which stay inside the splines and just use pry bar and just pop it out alright I took this mount front mount from this because it holds our engine and transmission together and I took off this bracket also now I will let it down guys and I all loose all the bolts around I all left just one two bolts from the underneath and we need to put something and that means the engine to hold engine because we take our right side mount and engine left just in one mount on the right side this is why I will use jack stand and put some piece of wood and just hold the engine and also you can use some special tool special bracket to hold the engine from the top side you never expect guys but one bolt between the transmission and engine block sized inside will have a lemon in block and it corroded inside the thread and I try to move it left right side left right side but anyway it's stuck inside and finally I broke the bolt it happens sometimes I got transmission out guys I used transmission jack to hold the transmission from the bottom side and just popped it out I use cross crossbar to hold our engine now our engine hold just on the crossbar and on the Left mount now I need to take the clutch out you can see guys it's not easy job and it will be not really comfortable to take the transmission on your garage or driveway you need a rack you need transmission jack you need some special tool like crossbar which holds our engine and if you work in the shop and you have all equipment you can do it but I had I had I had done it on the floor without Jack without transmission jack but it's paying us going next we change this bearing it's just simple spacer it's not not exactly bearing but it holds and center our shaft transmission shaft we use special told this one to take it out and just just hit it back whoa wall the dust and wipe the fly will surface if you have some groove some waves and somewhere on the flywheel you must replace it for I will also I also do not forget to wipe the all the grease from pressure plate we install our bearing we put some grease in it and we're ready to put the flywheel and our disk we use special plastic tool to hold our disk exactly on the center it's really important because when you push the transmission in it and it's not lined up in center you have problem too much to fit the transmission inside the hole inside the center this is why to use a special tool usually it's provided with all set with all clutch step and just mount it straight on the center our disk lined up exactly in the center and I type pressure plate and we're ready to put the transmission back here are some specific torque but either I target around 40 Newton these balls pairs or play balls let's throw the transmission now when everything is tight we can remove the our tool here we go our transmission is ready I change the bearing pressure plate bearing put some lube underneath it and we're ready to move it in here we go our transmission and now we raise the engine up whose transmission match our mount bolts with transmission transmission mount and now we can take this bracket we can take this tool out and put everything back together we tie it all our transmission around and draw the frame and tight the frame now we need to match our transmission mount holes and tied the transmission mounting bolts alright I connect all the cables and our slave cylinder back and now the filler plug I took it off and put some fennel with holes and for the oil back in transmission now let's just put the air filter box and battery I'm finished I showed you all everything step by step I I didn't go so deep in detail guys because it's not not a difficult job it's pretty simple I think some things small things I show you I showed you and it took me around six hours to take the transmission changing clutch and I hope you'll be able to get yourself after watching this video thank you for watching guys see you next video", "lMXn1IZvRKg": "are loan rhonda

when you use different sized car toes and outies you will end up screwing down woodenly needs go off and see that's actually connected and if you can hear that that's firing but oftentimes will just get screwed down one you mean - so when you unscrew your center pins actually push down a little in the middle so that bit gets crushed the arty has free movement up and down the little bit in there so sorry about the background noise that's just my daughter doing some cooking you can't cheat at any if you saw the way I did that you just tease it up litchi I'm just using a little Christmas cracker screwdriver poke it in one side give it a little left poking yeah we're giving it a little lift to make it even welcome to the learning book there we go so that should just once again fire absolutely find so literally it's just the case of popping that little center pin just sliding it up and you just gotta be a little bit careful because apparently you can break the connection so if you can tease the center pin up from a bratty you're using apparently it's best to try and do it on that first personally I find it quite hard to do on these ones so I usually just end up a little bit up on here so there you go if you have any problems anything just isn't firing but other stuff is working you got any go type connector or center pin arrangement then it's most likely that all right good luck have a good one knows", "07ihmDRP1Pg": "okay this video is kind of like a warning to any of you who buy this particular type of camera it's a mini DV d zero zero one M dat knockoff and it works very very well as you've seen in one of my videos they happen to call us a voice recorder but it's actually a 30 frames per second video recorder that uses a micro SD card hello out there you're probably wondering why I'm wearing this well the warning on this camera is it takes a micro SD card when I first got the camera I put the micro SD card in the camera then I went to plug it into my computer and it says please insert card and drive or something to that effect anyways I don't remember exactly what the woods were but I says what the hell is going on here because I got the thing plugged in with the USB cord USB 2 into the computer well I look into the slot and the card is gone now this happened last week when I got the camera I looked all over the room and you know how small a micro sd card is and you know when you haven't got good eyesight such as me it's virtually impossible to find things like that well I looked all over all week all over the desk all over the floor all of our cause is where they at the stereo was working at well I never did find that card until tonight because I got another card and I put it into the camera and the camera was working good when I did the leaf blowing incident up on the roof and everything everything was fine but there's a thing you have to do to the you have to put a text file in there with the date so that the computer can see the dates they can change the date because my date was a year behind whatever the date was then on the camel and was made I guess so in order to do that it didn't tell me I had to take the card out and put it into my card reader which is right here the UN a young little micro SD card adapter and put it in here so that's what I did I didn't want to do it well through the camera it didn't tell me to do it through the camera that didn't tell me to use a card reader so it told me that everything will be reformatted or the format will change or something like that I kept getting that message up when I wanted to put that text file in the text file consisted of a date and time and you had to type in the proper date and time and then put the card back into your camera and then plug the camera into your computer and that was successful using this I didn't want to do it using a camera so as a result I got it all changed I took it out of here and I went to put it in the camera I was right here and of course they use reading glasses all of a sudden I got the same error plug the camera into the computer and there is no there's no disc in the drive in other words the memory card isn't in there because you plug the camera in without a card it sees it as you know nothing no data there so it says don't tell me I lost another card something that's got to have it must have went inside the camera I shook the camera and I didn't hear anything rattling in there so I put this on and okay this is what I did this is the SD card micro SD card in there you can see it in there it fits flush with the housing but it it was a job getting in there and it kept coming out so I pushed it flush and it it wouldn't take so I took a paper clip and very gently pushed on the card and it went inside the camera so I says it has to be in the camera so you have one two three four screws and you have to break that seal but let's alright I ain't bringing this back anyways okay so you got four four screws which I had to magnetized the screwdriver using my telescopic magnetizer then I keep in my truck so I can pick up these grain assault size screws and what a job even when the magnification and everything to get these in here but I got it so basically this is a video to anyone who buys this camera I'm very happy with this but I'm also very happy that they found the card they will both inside here when I opened this up the batteries right here and the whole front of this camera all it works and everything stays in this part of it so you nothing falls out the card reader and the buttons all stay on this side and then the only thing you have is the battery on this bottom part right here so that when I open this up both cards fell out onto the table I was working right here on this white sheet of paper here so we'll give you a sample video of this armed camera to show now of the after results because I made some tests and it works well worked out quite well and we're going to give some videos of it in the house here and I'll let you judge for yourself and the date is correct now it's 2009 I have no way of getting rid of the date completely I doubt very highly that I'll be able to get rid of the date completely if anybody out there knows how to get rid of the date altogether because I really don't need it but I figured I'd at least try to make the date correct anyhow on this md80 or in this case a clone of the md80 the model d 0 0 1 nobody knows how to get rid of the date stamp on here well I'm sure a lot of people out there to have these cameras would like to know including myself so let's go on to a little video here very short clip to show you what this camera can do in the house okay I'm in Tommy's room here he's going to give you a very brief description of how his setup is for his recording go ahead tom well uh this is my multitrack recorder the tascam 414 here and these are my speakers in my subwoofer and my shure sm58 mic which I paid $100 for I took at our Center and we got some drum machine on Alyssa's SR 16 really easy to use and uh and some audio cables here hook up in the back of my computer here I guess okay well this is just a brief test of the camera so we figured we'd do it this is just a 60 watt bulb in this room right here this is all the lighting we have to work with it doesn't do too bad I guess in this kind of lighting alright that's the end of this test for this camera you", "pM-PNSq537Q": "what's up what's up family and friends it's your boy Frank ESCO once again I know it's been some time since I got in contact with y'all had a situation pop up once again at work this time I wasn't able to fix it at the job I actually had to come home and fix it pretty much what it was is every time I try to vape out of my little cartridge right here this just light would blink and it also happened to another one of my cartridges like this and this baby was brand new I was I was going crazy I've paid some good money for these cartridges so pretty much it was blinking it wasn't hitting I wasn't getting a pull from it nothing nothing nothing from this thing so pretty much what I figured out was all these things are just positive and negative heat coils going through that's all it is all these little vaporizers that's all they are so when it started blinking like that I was wondering if the wire from the inside was making contact with a negative or if the wire on the inside snapped let me try to show you what I mean all right so this is actually in the bottom of this one see if I could get this off with one hand and also at the bottom of this one you will have this little pin with the washer and a wire tucked in between it well if hopefully y'all guys can see that but my wire was snapped completely snapped off so what I did was I grabbed an old cartridge pulled off the rubber and ripped out as much wire as I could what I did after that was I took that wire with my tweezers wrapped it around the tweezers about twice to make kind of like a a ball of wire with a lead coming out of it I stuck the ball of wire directly down in there stuck the lead back through or straight up put the rubber piece around it because that's not supposed to make contact with anything on the inside if you understand that it's only supposed to make contact with the positive little pin or nipple whatever you guys want to call this thing so the wire goes in between the rubber and the metal once you get that going on the inside just make sure that there's a wire going across sometimes you got lucky if not the ball will hit the wrapping coils because all it is it's just a wire snapped so you're just making another connection with that wire so that it connects what you're positive you're negative everything's good you're able to hit and a vape again hopefully this helps some of you guys out I didn't really see an explanation like this out there but I'm able to hit my vape able to hit this bad boy yeah", "TT9bqIZeaqg": "our Miss Brooks starring Eve Arden well it's generally accepted that it's mostly women who try to keep their age as a secret but this theory was disproved last week at Madison High School where our Miss Brooks teaches English yes it was disproved most definitely by our beloved principal Osgood Conklin who celebrated the birthday last Monday when asked how old he was he replied a person is only as old as he feel and while I don't think he made that up himself he spent the entire week trying to out Mickey Rooney Mickey Rooney I was discussing with my landlady Friday morning at breakfast you mean to say Osgood is still making a spectacle of himself this is Davis he's the biggest spectacle since the greatest show on earth honestly he's making a fetish of being young Thursday he showed up at school wearing a bright red bow tie a bow tie how did it look it looked like somebody had wrapped his Adam's apple as a belated Christmas gift well there's one conservation Carling if mr. Conklin is so busy with himself he won't find time to bother you well he found some somewhere Tuesday morning he assigned me the task of purchasing a school bus a school bus will save money if we use our own bus for obtaining foundation so he persuaded the board to grant us an appropriation how much did they grant you one hundred and thirty dollars what the world can you get for that kind of money well so far I've only been offered one conveyance what kind a garbage truck but yesterday mr. Boynton offered to see what he could find so I turned the money over to him good for you Tommy mr. Boynton is one man who knows a bargain when he sees it present company excepted to leave the house I've got to take a couple of books back to the library oh it's mr. vine good morning miss Brooks since I knew I was coming over I phoned water and told him he needn't call for you this morning I hope you don't mind by taking that liberty mine it's a heck of a start please come in what brings you to this part of town mr. Barton you live on the other side of school with the price of gas I didn't drive my car here mr. Oakes I'm taking it down in the new school bus you mean you bought something for $130 that's right come over here to the window see no I don't say what's that police patrol wagon doing it what is what that's what I bought you mean our new school bus is a black Mariah I know the team isn't playing well but they don't deserve to be pinched I got it from a used car dealer he had a couple of them that were condemned as obsolete by the police department from the looks of it that thing should have been condemned to Devil's Island I know it doesn't seem like much now Miss Brooks but the kids at school can fix it up so you'll never recognize it and the price is the luckiest coincidence you ever heard of really well there was no sign on it at all when I got to the lot but when I told the dealer I had a hundred and thirty dollars to spend he admitted that's just what it cost that dealer was any more honest he'd be in jail come on let's get going oh just a minute mr. Barton we can't drive up to school in that mr. Conklin would blow a gasket but we could explain to him first we've got to cushion the blow mr. Barnum look mr. Conklin's on a big youth kick so it shouldn't be too difficult to butter him up what every month no more receptive frame of mind then we can spring our little bargain on him well that might be the best course to pursue right I'm already too oh hello mr. boy come here mrs. Davis look out the window yeah well what do you know the paddy wagon I had no idea my library books with that much overdue that's what mr. Boynton bought for school mr. Davis when the kids fix it up you'll never recognize it though but we're going to take the regular bus to school to explain to mr. Conklin I would if I were you then I thought maybe you could drive it down to school for us about three o'clock this afternoon mrs. Davis after mr. Conklin knows about it would you mind very much I should say not I've always wanted to drive one of those to God folks here come my thanks and clang wait wait for the police hey you there are you quit speeding pull over to the curb well where do you think you're going to a fire right Rosi look mr. Barton there's mr. Conklin going into school now I'll stay behind this tree and you put the first coat of salve on him all right say from here it looks like you shaved off his mustache really I hardly ever noticed he had one when I'm with him his lips are flapping so fast it's just a blur yes ma'am just a minute wait up stretch I beg your pardon mr. Boynton did you call me strange oh it's you sir from the back I mistook you for our star athlete stretch Snodgrass well I'd star athlete well I guess I fooled a lot of people that way from the back faster and there's no mistaking who I look like from the front is that no sir although I haven't seen Robert Taylor in sometimes because I shaved my mustache I don't fancy myself another Robert Traylor Cary Grant maybe without the mustache you look extremely young if I may say so sir I I was wondering maybe if you had a little time after school perhaps you'd like to play some some handball with me a handball well I haven't played for several years I don't know much quite all right mister I know just how you feel you do yes sir and it's mighty decent of you to be so considerate it's obvious that you just want to spare us older fellows a thrashing Oh quite the reason I won't play today you see Boynton in honor of my birthday last Monday some of my large brothers gave me a little blowout last night you know what that sort of thing can lead to why we must have played charades half the night see well I better be hanging in my lab see you later Kerry mr. Conklin mr. Boylan yeah morning how are you today mr. Boynton mr. Boynton oh excuse me sir for a moment I didn't recognize you and you took me for mr. Boynton I apologize natural mistake yes you see I spoke to mr. Boynton on the phone about our new school bag oh then you did purchase one splendid miss Brooke splendid I knew you could get something for a hundred and thirty dollars tell me is it nice and roomy it'll hold 20 prisoners that's too while it wasn't easy to find I think it will work out what is it on the school grounds at present no sir I wanted to tell you a bit about it no not another word miss Brooks I don't want to hear a thing about it until it's performing I prefer to be surprised your chances are excellent contact me when you have the vehicle ready for inspection I'll see you later yes sir well at least I tried good morning miss Brooks wasn't that Daddy speaking to you just now yes Harriet I've got a message for him I was late getting out of the house this morning and right after daddy left the head of the Board of Education calling mr. stone yes mother spoke to him it seems Jason Brill the principal at Clay City High got an appropriation for a school bus at the same time we did and mr. stone is simply furious because of the type of bus they bought well what did they buy he'll never guess miss Brooks Jason Brill bought of all things an old patrol wagon I'm dead already no Cary that's exactly what mr. Boyden acting for me bought for Madison what but that's why mr. stone called to warn daddy against buying any outlandish conveyance you've got to do me a favor Harriet please don't give that message to your father until I see what I can do about exchanging our black Mariah all right gee I hope you can return it and get the money back of course if you can't maybe the shop class can fix the wagon some way before mr. stone season they'll either fix that wagon or mind will be fixed for good well after hearing about mr. stones attitude toward the patrol wagon we were going to use as a school bus I decided to take immediate action consequently I spent the next few hours very productively and by lunchtime I had accomplished no less than six fitting fingernails and told him of our dilemma let's see if I've got it straight if mr. stone found out that mr. Conklin intended to use a patrol wagon as a school bus he'd raised marry Ned with him mr. Conklin would then raise marry Ned with you because even though I bought the wagon you're the one to whom he delegated the authority and the board funds however so far mr. Conklin doesn't know about the patrol wagon nor does he know mr. stones phone call hence in this situation what our Miss Brooks and mr. Boynton going to do I don't know let's hear tomorrow's episode and find out I know why don't you telephone mrs. Davis tell her not to bring the wagon and then we'll take it back this evening and try to get a refund iPhone mrs. Davis six times mr. Barney and there's no answer she's undoubtedly driving all over town just for the fun of it condensing think of the fascinating type of hitchhikers with all the stops out the new bus you bought miss Brooks imagine the police patrol wagon for high school bus nobody but you could possibly have come through with such a delightfully I bought the wagon Walter you there go your grades in English and biology but I'd better give you the sealed envelope Harriet wanted me to deliver this sealed envelope yeah she said it contained a highly secret message and I shouldn't dare what anybody else get hold of it where is the message walnut just a second I'll take off my shoe I didn't want to fall into enemy hands good work and thank you Sam's face man never mind your shoes just tell me what it says your envelope only because your nose isn't long enough now come on Walter what's the message well Harriet was in her dad's office when he was out and mr. stone called and said he'd be here at 3 o'clock and Harriet says in the note that if you don't either get her father out of school earlier keep that wagon out of sight you're lying dude that's the noisiest secret message I ever received where are you going I must go where the gone deuce goes a goner deuce the me no body no famous bricks did you think of any way to get mr. Conklin home early no I didn't well you better do something pretty fast it's almost three o'clock already if I don't think of something soon mrs. Davis will be here with the patrol wagon and it'll be too late look Walter out the window she's here I'll say she's here listen to her wife that Bell it's like a kid with a new toy I'm glad you didn't get our hands on the revolver and blank cartridges I used in our last school play to open my big mouth she seems to be driving away no she's only going around at the other side of the school depart closer to mr. Conklin's office Walter so I'll just have to come clean and throw myself headfirst on the mercy of the court were you gone where else I must go where the gone goose girls are gonna lose for me nobody you're certain there were no phone messages for me Harriet nothing I can seem to remember daddy funny the Board granted as 130 dollars for school bus last week I was faking something enquiries about it from mr. stone when they come through with any money they usually want to know what it is Harriet they've come for me I have much time to explain but that party my logic brothers gave me last night got a little out of hand and several of the brothers were carted off in just such a vehicle they're going to take me by storm surely you're exaggerating daddy walking home from the barn from the club rooms troubling around with the fire hydrant just skylarking you understand but some neighborhood snoop must have turned in and allah go on well all of a sudden some totally incomprehensible reason the cap of the hydrant became unscrewed the water gushed into the street and the next thing I knew I heard the police patrol wagon approaching what did you do then well what could I do I drop the wrench and ran see hurry the papers got winded listen mr. stone learned of my participation my career at Madison would have been ended as it is it was prolonged for 12 hours are quickly my dearly through my inner office I mean alone I was looking so good afternoon I see my favorite yes I also know how you feel when you see me yes the police will be up here looking for me any minute the police looking for you well it's a long and gruesome tale but some of my large brothers were committing a bit of mischief last evening and a patrol wagon hauled them off to the Pope I got away but some stoolie reported the wagon is downstairs for me that's what you were going to tell me not exactly but I like your version better I wouldn't have been so blunt about it 15 years of teaching seven years of principle and it's all down the hydrant drain I'm ruined but why should he have to hear about it maybe I can stall the police off for you mr. Conklin would you really do you think you could I do anything to repay you anything please stop plucking at my sleeve you go into your inner office and wait I'll see what I can do in the copper discharge but here goes come in here no what is it officer whom did you want to see I give one as good Conklin you say you've come to take Osgood Conklin to prison please mrs. Davis make believe you're a policeman I'll explain later I am very sorry sergeant but he isn't here right now well where is the black how serious is this arrest anyway the chief says he's our number-one boy they owe him and we've broken the back of the crime wave well he might be somewhere around school if you'll wait right here I'll see if I can find it I'll be quick about it my orders are to bring him in dead or alive yes sir I'll be right back quick mr. Kaplan there's no time to lose I know I'm their number one Lord I can't understand it just because of a miserable fire hydrant did or alive I'm sure the department would get their real kicks bringing you in alive that is why don't you sneak out this side door this side door it's too late now come in good afternoon mr. Conklin I'm sorry but I can't talk you know sunny I'm in a terrible hurry what's the big rush Osgood you act like a cornered convict with a hound snapping at his heel simile mr. Stahr you're much too busy to see me now and I wouldn't want to take approaches this are you expecting me I left a message that I was coming down to discuss your new school bus message you left a message new school bus sound like The Andrews Sisters last one tomorrow Missy I'm I'm hurrying home to be with my wife she came down with virus pneumonia this morning oh she did well for your information twitchy my wife just phoned me and said mrs. Conklin is playing bridge at our house right now what they call a miracle drug I don't know what's going on around here but I'm not going to find out in this stubby cubicle why are you in here anyway hiding from the law the law I like the bit about the convict and the hounds better I'm going into your outer office where I can breathe don't go in there mr. stone please how do you do mrs. Davis this is Davis but where's the that is what happened to that I might as well confess mr. Conklin mrs. Davis drove the patrol wagon down here because that's what was purchased as our new school bus our new school bus your new school bus mr. stone feels about outlandish conveyances I can only say I'll take it back tonight you know nothing of the kind miss Brooke I'll admit I was furious with Jason Brill when I heard he brought a patrol wagon but well this afternoon he showed me just what the students at Clay City High did with it and honestly you never recognized oh well if that's the case wait till you see what we do with our patrol wagon I'm sure miss Brooks has dozens of ideas on the subject hundreds of idea then we'll take the bars out of the side take out a bar get rid of the bars good good then we can use those those two gallons of red paint just acquired by the shop class and then Oh before I continue mr. stone there's one thing I'd like to know what's that Miss Brooke where do you stand on fire engines we hardly miss on this book let us in on another episode in their life of the Treaty of Madison hi next week at the same time well there are a few poster friendships and the one between our Miss Brooks who teaches English at Madison High School and her landlady mrs. Margaret Davis they share each other's joys and sorrows problems and secrets and one cat named Minerva last Thursday this black beauty of the feline world was anticipating a blessed event ten since 6:30 in the morning we had been at the vets where an overanxious mrs. Davis had insisted on bringing Minerva by we I mean mrs. Davis and me and our neighbor's cat Timothy two hours we've been waiting almost two hours what's taking dr. Anderson so long please mrs. Davis try to calm down even Timothy isn't as jumpy as you are what is he doing here well why shouldn't he be here he's in the nervous husband take such an interest now dr. Anderson said he'd ring in here when he was ready so why not sit down and take it easy how about reading something well all right hand me a magazine common which one do you want it doesn't make much difference the one you're chewing on will be fine I guess I'm just a wee bit nervous myself now sit down mrs. Davis is very well at least these chairs are nice and soft now where did Timothy go you're sitting on him boy that cat can sleep through anything this is no time for tipping Connie what's taking so long you think everything is all right oh of course mrs. Davis a normal litter is five kittens and dr. Anderson said Minerva might have even more I'm just quoting the doctor Timothy I hope nothing happens to Minerva that kitty means a lot to me she means a lot to both of us yeah correction she means a lot to the three of us what a wonderful companion she's always being especially when I was alone night after night she used to sit at my feet with her ball of yarn and I'd read aloud or by the hour I guess you must have distracted her and all that time she never knitted one sweater remember the two little things she used to do in the morning how she used to jump up on the dining-room table when I brought your cereal I certainly do remember that cat could let the milk from under my crack please before they stopped firing I can't help feeling something's wrong Oh Minerva dear Minerva don't believe me oh look mrs. Davis not only is Minerva not going to leave you but in a few minutes she'll present you with so many little Minerva's you won't know what to do with them that it'll be a problem won't it yeah we can't possibly keep all of them here in our place not unless we marry the milkman I know a lady in my filling circle who take two of them she's crazy about kittens rich lady is that mrs. cash but you will have to help me dispose of the rest Connie perhaps somebody at Madison would help us out maybe mr. point we would want a pet if he did I wouldn't be single now we'll be across that bridge the signal dr. Anderson finished as you write that Connie wait for me well should only a few minutes more Timothy and you'll know how large a family you've got I hope for the children's sake they look like Minerva well anyway the girls the best I'm jumping the gun until we get mrs. Davis's report there's no sense in conjecturing I mean Tommy gets hot I'm a father Timothy years you hear that Tim you're a father the barn is a Davis thanks for the lift well good morning Walter joking educator she stops fizzing an hour ago Davis trap-jaw how come he didn't avail yourself as a Denton delivery service today it was part of an emergency Walter I had to visit the veterinarian with mrs. Davis really so I hope you didn't find anything wrong with it you said you were going to a vet with mrs. Davis and I said I know what you said Walter I'm willing to forget it if you are actually mrs. Davis became a grandmother today her grandmother no foolin what do you wait about a quarter of a pound each that's two pounds altogether eight times a quarter of a pound you're not reaching me miss good it's like this Minerva no what's the use you're old enough to have heard about the birds and bees aren't you don't tell me Minerva gave birth to 8b no kidding she had aren't much bigger which brings us by way of Passaic to the subject at hand what are mrs. Davis and I going to do with a kitten well you should have thought of that before you any way in which I can be of help there is Walter you're fond of pets aren't you oh sure and then it's settled you can take two of the kittens home yeah well I'd like nothing better but how do you think they'd get along with wolf whoo yeah my father's police dog he's awfully vicious Owen this was to my father he's what they call a one-man dog that's enough of a meal for any dog my parents tried that but he chewed you four of them the nozzles not a parent Sam sir we'd better consider wolves pal who's his pal a mongoose no no but almost is bad my dad thought it would calm him down if he had a companion so he brought home a pretty bloodthirsty Bulldog the other night now all in all I don't think our house is the spot for a kitten it doesn't sound like any shangri-la okay idea why don't you try mr. Boynton I'd love to I mean my next stop I hope you don't mind my dropping in on you before class mr. Barnhill not at all miss Brooke's it's nice to have you visit my lab occasionally you'll have to excuse me for a moment while I finish feeding these rabbits go right ahead I'll bet you've never seen anyone fed with an eyedropper before not since the last time you treated for life no I never have open your mouth wider come on wider spill I don't know please miss Brooke's they won't eat when you're clowning like that it'll just take another minute well if I'm disturbing you mr. Bach oh no no you're not disturbing me at our Miss Brooks that's one thing about you when you're in the lab with me I can always concentrate perfectly on whatever else I'm doing that's what I get for buying a perfume called no what was it you wanted to see me about well to begin at the beginning mr. Barr he I went to the vets this morning with mrs. Davis really I hope he didn't find anything wrong with her good one myself went to the wild a Miss Brooks you got off that one too soon that has matched it we went to the vet because of mrs. Davis's cat Minerva what happened to her what happened to her also happens to a dog she had a puppy a kitten what are you going to do with eight kittens now that's what I call a leading question mr. Barney since you're so fond of pets it gives me great pleasure to offer you any two of the kitties you want well I'd love to take a couple of them miss Brooke then it's settled as soon as they can leave their mother and I'll be finished I'd love to take him but I can't why not if you've got a bloodthirsty Bulldog - no but there's my cut frog McDougald he's allergic to catch now I'm allergic to mcdougal you stay out of this max the guide kitten requires more attention I'm sorry I'm hardly ever in my apartment with Brooks and well as much as I'd like to help you out it just simmers down to the simple question what can a bachelor do Oh hoo-hoo have I got an answer for that one well try as I might I couldn't find a home for any of Minerva's kittens and my lunchtime I had almost exhausted my list of prospects that is all except one our beloved principal mr. Conklin mindful of the adage you can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar I decided to visit his web I mean I went to him hmm bearing a large slab of his favorite dessert banana cream pie when mr. Conklin saw me in his doorway his reaction was one of pure delight please miss Brooke whatever you were going to do with that pie don't do it I know you've been under a strain lately but I've just had this shoot cleaned and it's such a gooey pie I was just going to let you have it that's what I was afraid of here I'll just set it down on your desk near the chair hmm see I didn't get any on you at all I'm not out of the woods yeah probably jump into my lap after you leave now watch may I ask is the reason behind this sacrificial offering it's merely a slight expression of my esteem for a good and kind principal if it's all the same to you I feel safer when I'm crabby mean old Marblehead now what do you want miss Brooke one well surely I can make a nice gesture toward you without wanting something can't I well I suppose so that's better now here's what I want you see sir mrs. Davis and I had to go to the vet this morning really I hope he didn't find anything wrong with you at least where I hope he didn't find anything wrong with you we went to the vet because our cats Minerva had a litter this morning well congratulations was it a preponderance of boys or girls oh we don't know yet but they're either the cutest kittens you ever saw Minerva's so proud indeed remind me to drop her a card on Mother's Day now tell me miss Brooks what in heaven's name and you're going to do with eight kitten that's just the question I needed here mr. Conklin we can't possibly keep all those kitten so I thought you and mrs. Conklin might take a couple off our hands you thought what for your information miss Brooks my home is not now nor will it ever be a Depot for stray felines I am definitely anti cat but mr. Carson - in my word you have chosen the worst possible time to bring up the subject of household pets only last month I got rid of a gigantic police dog a police dog my wife had taken a fancy to the brute five a week she spent every evening with him in our living room where did you spend yours on top of the piano what a vicious beast he was even his name made me nervous whoa whoa but I know a wolf keep your private affairs the only reason I permitted the animal to went to my house was because of my wife someone told her the previous owner had been mean to the creature and that's all she needed my wife Falls for every sob story she hears about animals she must be awfully tender-headed hearted indeed the last few years we've had a steady procession of Paris Canaries goldfish monkeys and dog why we even harbored a small deer at one time a deer how did she happen to take that someone told her he'd sprained his ankle falling out of a tree get back to the latest monster I got rid of Wolf by presenting him to the father of one of my pet peeves Walter Denton yes I know sometimes I can picture them both in the backyard together and I conjure up a rather delightful vision a vision wherein one of them flips his leash and they clash the animal world you'll have to work out no what is it Harriette the school custodian wants to see you right away one of the first pot sizzling carriers don't get too close to the desk but he says it's urgent wine watch out for that pie oh oh there's no damage sir luckily it fell on this old rag on the chair that old rag happens to be my top coat I knew you'd get me sooner or later daddy why collaborator come on these are just the trouble spot you stay here and take any incoming phone calls miss Brooke's but care what about my lunch it will find a delicious piece of banana pie on the second button of that code I have to do everything in this school my own two hands doesn't get what a sour ball really oh well we can't all be hello sour balls office yes mrs. Davis that's right dear I haven't been able to find a home for any of the kitchens yeah me there mrs. Davis but I think I've got an idea good Oh before you tell me what it is Connie the funniest thing happened when I spoke to the chairwoman of the Ladies Aid about our dilemma what was it well first I said I went to the vet this morning with Connie Brooke and then she said really I hope you didn't find anything wrong well now we've completed the cycle but mrs. Davis through mr. Conklin I think I've picked up a clue that may solve our problem that is if Walter and Harriet and mr. Boynton cooperates now here is the scheme you bring Minerva and the kittens down to the side entrance of Madison right out mr. Conklin isn't back from school yet miss Brooke's but you can wait for him right here in his study thanks mrs. Conklin I'll just put this basket down they're pretty heavy it looks like a laundry basket with a pillow flip over it that's what it is a laundry basket with a pillow slip over it I see going to drop it off on your way home I wish I could no I'm afraid it's not as simple as that I don't understand what's in the basket in the basket oh nothing much nothing worth meowing about I say nothing worth meowing about please see that basket what why there's a caddy in here and a kitten and another kitten and another kitten he's going our ways who carry his business Brooke she belongs to someone who lives very close to us mrs. Conklin but I'd rather not burden you with a whole heartbreaking and pathetic story what story no mrs. Conklin you've got enough troubles of your own oh please miss Brooke what troubles have I got this just mr. Conklin to look after he what I mean no I wouldn't want you to know that the neighbor to whom these little creatures belong used to beat their mother every day he used to beat her not only that but he made her work for him every night when he cleaned out his furnace he tied a cart to her and made her haul the ashes outside works like a dog mrs. Khan how terrible but but how did she manage to have these kittens they look like they were just born it was her first day off in a month that's why I picked him up out of the driveway where he left them how could anyone be so cruel he practices a lot I ask you sir Davis if we might keep them but our place is so small it's out of the question but what are you going to do with them return them to our neighbor I guess at least they'll be fed while they're getting beaten I'd give anything if I could keep them here it's a deal I'm afraid mr. Conklin wouldn't stand for it not after the experience he went through with our police dog wolf honestly sometimes I think mr. Kaufman was jealous of him wolf probably barks louder it was only some way I could keep them oh forget it mrs. Conklin why should you concern yourself over the horrible fate that's inevitable for these tiny little innocent kittens who've never harmed anyone I'll just take them and return the weight I will keep them I'll just have to refrain from telling Osgood about it until he's in a really gay mood there'll be old cast by there now let's see if they're comfortable oh they look a little cramped in that basket I'll just put this pillow slip on the desk and rest some of them on that come on kitty now you two now don't you worry mom I'll do it your babies I just put two more on the desk and we'll all be more comfy won't we I feel better already Oh No quick put the big cat in the basket behind the couch I'll be with you in a minute here what about those kittens on the bed I put them in these boys they're nice and movies now everything is out of sight cost as soon as they stop shaking quite a trying day at school good afternoon mr. Conklin and I can see it hasn't ended yeah what are you doing here miss Brooke oh well I invited her over to have tea with us our good hire I thought that would be nice teas where is the tea it's in this we couldn't wait no we we felt a bit weak we we've all had a rather hard day dear I'll go along with that now if you'll both excuse me I've got some things to do at my desk before dinner seems to do at your day before dinner you must be weak it takes two of you to hold up one Centon it isn't good for you to get to work as soon as you come home you you've been under a most grueling pressure for the past eight hours yes indeed sir you have no idea how much that's sitting around all day tastes out of you I mean sitting around and making decisions there's no sense why why don't you go into the living room and does sprawl out on the couch and take a nice nap for about ten hours you know what say there's nothing like a cat nap to me why don't I just shut up that's the best suggestion you've made in months now please pardon me but I've got to jot down some notes let's see my pencils must be in this drawer oh dear it's always so cluttered up better take this blotter out first and I'll remove these two furry black paper ways now this carbon paper can go oh just as I thought here are my pencils right what are these two kitten was doing in the top drawer of my desk you ain't seen nothing yet Oh calm down I can explain now you might as well open the next drawer the next drawer there are two more kittens in here jazz the place is infested with some desks have termites yours has kids and now once again here is our Miss Brooks well mr. Conklin soon put two and two together then I took the four of them and put them back in the basket with their mother even though I had told her a rather large fibs mrs. Conklin was quick to forgive after all I was good Miss Brooks is only guilty of wanting to find a home for these eight helpless kitten granted and I'd be more than happy to suspend her sentence if she will immediately collect her mewling mousers and March there's nothing else I can do of course mrs. Carson I was hoping someone could keep them at least until they're old enough to be torn from their mother's side oh I'd love to oh good don't use not another word Martha in the months that mastodon wolf was under this roof my nervous system had all the pet it could stare what broke out of the Denton's backyard and he's on our front porch this very minute what's he doing there well when I left him he just eaten up half the welcome mat oh I hope it doesn't dull his fangs he just won't stay at the dances daddy I think he wants to come back and live with us I couldn't stand it not for another minute you've got to get rid of him somebody's got to take him away mr. Conklin I'll make you a proposition if you'll let mrs. Conklin keep the kittens here I'll take wolf home with me what's that if we keep the kittens you will remove that dinosaur from the premises and thanks for everything to drive its roots and save you well where are you will right over here miss Brooke did I do a good job of barking oh just perfect mr. boy you were very convincing then they're gonna keep the kitchen they certainly are and now the least I can do is keep my end of the bargain what do you mean miss Brooke come on wolf we're going home I'm out of soap Colgate dental cream and Palmolive shave cream bring you our Miss Brooks starring Eve Arden once again for another comedy episode of our Miss Brooks under the direction of Al Lewis but first now just one brushing with Colgate dental cream removes up to 85% of decay and odor causing bacteria yes just one brushing with Colgate's instantly stops on pleasing breath in seven out of ten cases that originate in the mouth and if you really want to stop decay be sure to follow the Colgate way over a two-year period the Colgate way of brushing teeth right after eating stop more decay for more people than ever before reported in dentists history x-ray showed no new cavities whatever for almost two out of three people and only the Colgate way does all three cleans your breath while it cleans your teeth and stops most tooth decay so for a cleaner fresher mouth all day always use Colgate dental cream remember just one brushing with Colgate dental cream removes up to 85% of the bacteria that cause on pleasing breath and tooth decay toothpaste last Thursday principal Osgood Conklin received formal notice that Cosmopolitan magazine was planning a feature story dealing with life at Madison High our Miss Brooks who teaches English there can attest to the fact that this news was greeted with tremendous elation by teachers and students alike yes indeed I haven't seen so many smiling faces since mr. Conklin fell down the school steps as I remarked my landlady at breakfast Friday morning cosmopolitan is a magazine of considers can see oh yes considerable stature mrs. Davis it's a great honor to have a story about our school appear in it don't you think I should say so nothing like that ever happened to the high school I attended Connie the only story ever written about us appeared in the police Gazette yes our principal killed an English teacher well let's hope the story in Cosmopolitan isn't a sequel it was a rather unusual case he struck her with a blunt object a blunt object it was a cash register it seems she saw him trying to hustle off at the cafeteria receipt and yelled for the police that's when he let her have it Wendell I get the feeling you made the whole thing up mrs. Davis I'll have my eggs now I want to finish breakfast before Walter Denton gets here around here you idea Walter told me a cosmopolitan photographer dropped in at school yesterday that's right a fellow named Haney he was laying out some shops he plans to take this morning I bet you're hoping you'll snap your picture Connie oh don't be absurd I'm no publicity hound mrs. Davis why should I want my picture to appear in a magazine doesn't mean anything to me well it's just a coincidence that I happen to be wearing my best dress this morning coincidence honestly if you think I'm trying to look attractive so that photographer will snap my picture you're sadly mistaken when I woke up I was thinking it was Sunday so I put on my sunday dress that's all there is to it of course and I guess it was mere coincidence that you are up till 4:00 in the morning pitching your hair guilty your honor come in oh if it's all the same to you mrs. Davis I'd prefer that we don't mention this magazine story at all very well dear events the way you wanted I'll shut up like a tram I bet you're hoping mr. Haney will snap your picture for the cosmopolitan this morning holder nice Fleming mrs. Davis oh why should I want my picture in a big important magazine it's only a coincidence that I happen to be wearing my Sunday suit is that your son bee suit yes he was up until 4:00 in the morning fixing his hair yes I did spend a minute or two combing my wave at a devil-may-care angle yeah but the one who'll really be primping this morning is Miss Ann right Miss Ann right yeah miss Brooke's fellow English teacher and her hottest rival in the rat race for mr. Boynton whoa well she's fond of him too and she probably feels that he'd sit up and take notice of her picture was to peer in Cosmo gosh you should have seen her fawning over mr. Haney in the cafeteria yesterday yeah I was rather surprised though at the compliment she paid you miss Brooke's compliment yes ma'am as she was pointing out how lucky you are that you don't have to diet like she does she said she thought it was wonderful how you managed to stay so scrawny and yet eat like a horse oh she did did she yeah and mr. Haney said he thought you were very attractive and he asked her how old you are well what did Miss Enright say to that well she told him she doesn't know your age because she's never been able to count your teeth Walter when we get to school you'd better count Miss Enright's teeth twice twice before and after I clip her hello there miss Brooke's oh good morning mr. Haney I was just about to see if mr. Boynton is in his laboratory he is I ducked in there a minute ago to avoid miss Enright she's been hounding me like a house detective hoping I'll snap her picture so far I've evaded that little chore but I picked up a nice shot at mr. Boynton uh-huh now I'd like one of you miss Brooks hold still please that's it you snapped my picture mr. Haney I did it'll appear in the next issue of Cosmopolitan well I've got to get along now thanks miss Brooke see you later oh thank you mr. Haney bye now good morning mr. Biden oh hi miss Brooks say really dog up why you look like the cat's pajamas let's watch that racy dialogue in school Mr Bond you know killing that dress is a knockout oh it's just a little thing I wear around the house during the coronation mr. Haney just snapped my picture and he told me he shot one of you mr. Barnes yes I was quite surprised I certainly wasn't prepared to be photographed this morning near Warren it's only a coincidence that I happen to be wearing my Sunday suit I know you haven't had that thing out of the mothballs since the Easter Parade that's perfectly true miss Brooks but last night the thought occurred to me that it would blend nicely with my new hat when did you buy a new hat this morning on the way to school how late were you up fixing your hair until Florida JAXA I might as well admit it the prospect of having my life disappear in a magazine is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me isn't it the most exciting thing that ever happened to you you should know over to mr. Conklin's office and tell him to look for our pictures in cosmopolitan it might command some respect from the old boy well I see you at lunch mr. Viner you better I think I'll get there a little early what shall I order for you for me what's my treat miss Brooks you can have anything your heart desires anything well in that case I'll get there a little early too mr. Barney how about seeing Jane Wyman's new picture at the state tonight what's the name of it well it's a very nostalgic title remember the time last Christmas when you kissed me under the mistletoe yes the pictures call let's do it again it makes me ill see that photographer snapping pictures of our teachers and students while we're trying to conduct school Harriet after giving the matter due consideration I have decided to kill the cosmopolitan story what oh but that's unfair daddy you're just jealous because mr. Haney refused to take a picture of you that is not true I have always spurned the spangled lore of publicity getting my picture snapped is the farthest thing from my mind then why did you come to school the fact that I'm wearing my Sunday suit is a coincidence coincidence mother told me you were up until 4:00 this morning combing your hair over the bald spot why I'm thicker on top than any man my age the fact remains that this institution has a rather toothy rule to the effect that no teacher may be either interviewed or photographed by a representative of a public periodical without the express permission of principal Osgood Conklin I am principal Conklin how do you do you are bucking for cafeteria KP oh please daddy you only dust off that ancient rule for your own convenience look you've been photographed by the press many times how come you've never applied the rule to yourself you're impertinent questions shall be stricken from the record I say that as yet no member of my faculty has sought my permission if I should learn therefore that any teacher has already been photographed by the snap happy gent from cosmopolitan that teacher is in for a mess of trouble come in oh hi miss Brooks good morning Harriet mr. Conklin I have some happy news for you filed their taxes notice on the bulletin board for me Harriet now run along yes sir see you later Miss Brooks bye dear that notice is for the benefit of my teachers miss Brooks a rather timely reminder of rules 608 you've run afoul of it once or twice in the past I believe rule 608 oh is that the rule you applied a couple of years ago sir when the Evening Post took pictures of some teachers and neglected to take one of you that's the little beauty I plan to take drastic action against any teachers who have permitted themselves to be photographed without my permission now watch the happy news you have four name I forget anything else you'd care to discuss with me yes sir mr. Boynton and I would like your permission to be photographed for Cosmopolitan magazine permission denied oh but mr. Canton won't you reconsider I have spoken oh please sir this is very heavy miss Brooks that you and Boynton have already been photographed without your permission how can you even think of such a thing it's easy realize that fallacious denials will prove futile when the issue comes out the pictures of those teachers who flaunted my authority will be all the evidence I need anything else yes sir exactly what measures do you plan to take against those teachers the faculty rolls of the good ship Madison High have not yet been logged for the fall semester miss Brooke's those mutineers whose pictures appear in Cosmopolitan will have to walk the plank anything else just one thing where's the plane then listen for a few days only you can get a large tuba Palmolive shaving cream free of extra cost right a large tube of either Parmalee brushless or Palmolive lather free of extra cost when you buy a giant view but regular price save up to 35 cents and treat yourself to a smoother more comfortable all day shave the Palmolive shaving cream weigh 1200 men tested the Palmolive shaving cream way and no matter how they shave before three out of four reported smoother more comfortable longer lasting shave why even in colder hard water you get a close clean shave every time and it's an all-day shave to a shave that most men find really lasts from morning till night treat yourself to the tested and proved prom alley shaving cream way remember Palmolive shaving cream is America's favorite brand so cash in on this offer and save while you shave with Palmolive brushless or ladder remember sale positively ends when dealer supplies of this combination package are gone so act now buy a giant tube of Palmolive brushless or Palmolive ladder shave cream and get a large tube free of extra cost well when mr. Boynton read mr. Conklin's bulletin board notice about unauthorized Press photographs his reaction clearly told me that I'd have to buy my own lunch since food is such a good buffer against panic I loaded my tray and headed for mr. boring news table before I got there however I was intercepted by Miss Enright hello hello Miss Brooks you do have enough there for a horse don't you get off the track dear I'm heading for the starting gate yes naturally but you'd better go easy on those potatoes darling a girdle can only do so much you know because I never wear a good or myself I know I hear you donated yours to the Air Force for catapulting jet job oh you are comical darling have you seen the Cosmopolitan's photographer around anywhere mr. Haney he was at the steam table a minute ago but I'd suggest you read the bulletin board before you strike a series of poses will be no desire to be photographed for his magazine miss books it's just a coincidence that I happen to be wearing a stunning new dress of course I'm sure it was also coincidence that you were up until 4:00 in the morning grooming your transformation oh you are such a doll I often wonder what you are stuffed with remind me to send you an autographed x-ray excuse this old gray mare I'll go put on the feedbag won't you just I'll see you later though it's inevitable I guess oh I'm sorry I kept you waiting mr. Barney alright ok miss Brooks guy said that bulletin board notice has me worried sick I'd like to see my picture in cosmopolitan but I certainly don't want to risk my job for it well I don't relish the idea of unemployment either mr. barnman I asked mr. Haney for our negatives but he flatly refused to turn them over he said his first obligation is to his magazine unless we can think of something else I'm afraid room didn't you order lunch no I hire so upset I just grabbed some coffee oh then you can have some of mine I have plenty I should say you have gosh you've got enough there for a horse well like you'll share it with me I'll be able to get my saddle on easier here you are a lamb chop some potatoes I've got a scheme that might save us our jobs mr. Brooks I I found out that mr. Haney is keeping his potato photographic his photographic equipment in the faculty room the negatives are in his gadget bag so somehow without his knowledge we've got to slip our negatives out of that bag and destroy them but that's a pretty dangerous assignment mr. barnman I'm afraid you'll have to count me out but the end justifies the means it's our only chance the fall term rolls around do you want to be out of a job you want to be pounding the streets looking for work discouraged tired hungry give me a pencil and we'll sketch the layout Louie hi daddy did you call mr. stone at the Board of Education I did he not only informed me that mr. Haines his assignment had been officially cleared through the board but that he was delighted to learn that cosmopolitan plans to run a pictorial story on Madison High oh well don't you let it get you down daddy how can I help it can't you visualize my embarrassment at that magazine should run pictures of Madison's teachers and not one lousy not one shot of its principal well I figured a way out I ran home and took some negatives from my own camera several attractive shots of myself posed the way you like to see me what are you gonna do with them I learned that the negatives mr. Haney plans to ship after cosmopolitan are now reposing in his gadget bag in the faculty room Harriet somehow without his knowledge I've got to slip my negatives into that bag oh that sounds pretty risky Danny and justifies the means now run along child all right daddy but you better be careful oh excuse me miss Enright I was just leaving bye dad goodbye what's on your mind miss Enright well a minute ago I paused outside your door at the water fountain mr. Conklin I couldn't help overhearing the scheme you out lying to Harriet and I should like to suggest a partnership partnership yes I'd like to run a home and get some of my negative so that they may be slipped into the gadget bag along with yours what are you trying to blackmail a principal of a public high school how dare you one moment sir let me remind you that my family is quite well-to-do and that I don't give a hoot whether I whether or not I teach here next semester secondly if I should have a little chat with mr. Haney and the head of the Board of Education informing them of whether I happened how soon can you get back with your negative there's the gadget bag miss Brooke's well now's our chance now is your chance to what miss Brooke's to faint catch anyone we we merely wanted to look at the negatives of those pictures you snapped of us this morning mr. Haney we I just can't wait until they appear in the magazine no indeed Hot Diggity and zippity-doo-dah well I'll be glad to show them to you later on mr. Boynton right now I want to go and pick up some shots of the gym I'll have to leave in a minute in a minute oh well we'll come back later on yes indeed come on mr. Barton yeah bye mr. Haney so long why not you sure made a nice dark room out of the wardrobe closet in here mr. Haney there are those negatives in there the ones you took this morning that's right Walter they're complete except for one shot of mr. Boynton which I left over there in the gadget bag the light wasn't so good in the lab so I decided not to use it Photography sure is fascinating work what's in this package mr. Haney oh that's another assignment I'm working on they're pictures of some gangsters for a story called wanted by the FBI say I wonder if you would get me some sealing wax and take them over to the post office oh I'd be glad to I'll be right back mr. aney good I'll wait for you I can develop some of those negatives in the darkroom meanwhile careful are you sure mr. Haney left well I I couldn't see him from where we were hiding but I heard the door slam now let's risk this gadget bag oh that's funny there's only one negative in here see that's the negative of the one he snapped of me how can you tell see I'm holding my frog well I'll just stick this in my purse and we'll look for the other negatives might be in this package I'll take a look oh gosh this is a frightening picture I've never seen such a pasty-faced evil looking individual must be miss Enright no it's a man and there's a note on it wanted by the FBI I better put it back in the package someone's coming we're stuck behind this couch cricket all clear sir good let's get out that gadget bag yes here it is mr. Cochran it's empty Oh evidently mr. Haney transferred the Madison High negatives into this package here well we will just slip our negatives in along with the others oh excuse me fault Oh what do you want Denton Oh mr. Haney asked me to get some sealing wax for this package I've got to rush it over to the post office it's going to Cosmopolitan magazine yeah yes no there's not a minute to lose boy take it over to the post office immediately and with my blessing yes sir well we did it miss Enright soon we'll be celebrities those pictures are printed in cosmopolitan we'll be the talk of the nation well come on sir we'd better get out of here before what's wrong partner we're not alone mr. Conklin look at those shoes sticking out from behind the couch who's that behind the couch there's nobody here but us horses miss Brooke's join them good afternoon sir will dispense with the amenities you two sneaks CMAs and right on me sneaking our negatives into that package we did and I have news for you sir that package had nothing to do with Madison hi the pictures in it were marked wanted by the FBI what we were sneered in our own trap why didn't you stop us miss Brooke's you saw what we were doing I saw what everyone was doing this in right mr.

Haney I should like first to intercede on Miss Enright's behalf she's a peculiar type type of what we won't go into but there are times when she is not responsible for her actions yes that's very true Thank You mr. Boynton and as for mr. Conklin well everybody does stupid things once in a while he's just more consistent small wonder my wife calls me knucklehead tell him miss Brooke mr. Haney as a favor to me please don't print mr.

Haney and thank you Miss Brooks was springing to my defense dear sweet lovable lovable or not I'm afraid I can't be as lenient with you miss Brooks with me mr.

Davis called me to breakfast that morning my mood was far from grim for by that time I had convinced myself the taking a new term at school is not after all like returning to prison good morning Tommy good morning warden apparently the box of sweets it please oh that's not Rhys it's Connie it doesn't matter I like almost any kind of cereal cream please well alright new idea what kind of cereal is this mrs.

Davis it's an evergreen plant it did get a alright the trouble is I have too many private plants around the house as it is I don't know what in the world could do with it I have a suggestion mrs. Davis since this is the first day of school it might be a shrewd political move on my part to present the plants to our beloved principal hey that ought to get you in real solid with old Marblehead I agree Connie I think it's mighty important that you start off on the right foot with your principal is terms as he said to me when I saw him in the drugstore yesterday oh you know what did he say absent-minded lately oh let's see now flat teeth mr. Carson City to me mrs. Davis how about getting Walter a glass of milk no that wasn't it mr. Carson doesn't care for to get milk cannot Tommy I just remembered what mr.

Johnson I'll take it out put it down you Indian giver no much as I dread boring you with school business it's my duty to inform you that there is to William meeting here in my office at 3:00 this afternoon a meeting which you in your capacity as faculty adviser must attend oh I'll be here three o'clock yes sir it's be a routine meeting restricted to school personnel I presume by no means we'll be rubbing elbows with an official from the State Board of Education who literally holds our jobs in the palm of his hand mr. Milton Craig way the power milton crag way wields in our sphere is fantastic we must therefore exert every effort miss Brooke's to make a good initial impression on it you know start off on the right foot yes sir rest assured that heads will roll if we should in any way displease mr. crag way or his assistant his assistant she's a distinguished member of our school board mrs. Gregory you're on a Daily Double IP good morning miss Brooke hi mr. Biden miss Brooke's I've got a problem you've got a problem why serious kept me awake all night I have here a list of names whose homes I visited yesterday upon my return from a camping trip I scratched off the names of all those whom I've sent contacted when I've scratched your name I will have scratched Alba mr. Conklin I suppose all this sounds rather mysterious to you miss Brooks it does in the scratchy sort of way well near the campsite I haven't upon some interesting fauna one specimen of which I brought back to town I have the plant with me when I went visiting in fact that's why I know I must have inadvertently left is it one of the homes on my list it's a potted plant wrapped in cellophane oh that one mrs. Davis thoughts of delivery Boyd lefted it was found on our porch this morning mr. binder oh gosh certainly a relief to know where I can lay my hands on it it's cellophane wrapping it's for protective reasons you see I wouldn't dare expose it until the moment I can actually put it to use in a biology experiment biology experiment well yes miss Brooks that plant happens to be poison ivy it's divine what is it miss Brooke's you don't have to scratch mr. Conklin by now he's scratching himself mr. Boynton drops the bombshell in my lap I promptly dashed over to mr. Conklin's office but neither he nor the poison ivy plant was there such was the case each time I returned at the scene of the crime during my morning classes but finally when I entered the school cafeteria at noon there was mr. Conklin at the scene table with his daughter Harriet as he picked up his tray and headed for a table I meats into action mr. Conklin sorry I'm not Soviet razor if I knew you were coming I'd have baked unbreakable meatballs I'll sell them you want the same order daddy excuse me miss Brooks mr.

Craig Way will be unable to attend heaven it'll be ready in a second and let me finish Harry about that potted plant I gave you as I intimated at the time I cannot ethically accept any form of bribe tinted gift from a faculty member mr. Oakes therefore without bothering to so much as remove its wrappings I tossed the plant Hassan all into the incinerator oh thank you mr. Conklin I'll order my lunch now odd beaver if you really burn that plant daddy of course not I used it for political purposes Harriet that is I walked over to the Board of Education and presented it to mr. stone the head man himself no wonder I couldn't find you in your office if I'd known you were with mr. Starrett the entire morning with him yes indeedy naturally expressed keen disappointment when I told him that our meetings will not be graced by the presence of Milton crag way and mrs. Dodd what Oh apparently you didn't leave the message I left on your desk a half hour ago mrs.

Craig way what's good enough for a member of the school board is good enough for me", "kBbqaEMgesc": "hello and welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about a really really common problem and it is the center pin issue what is that you may ask the center pin issue is if this little plate inside here is too low and doesn't make any proper connection anymore with this little pin inside here with the atomizer positive pole or with sorry with the positive pole of your atomizer which is this bit in here most people think the battery is completely faulty and can't you can't go to work any more that's actually a little mistake because you can get it to work if you bet this Saturday the center pin actually can be too low after week of use after 2 weeks of use after 3 weeks of use or even after 6 month I don't know the reason for that is actually some atomizers have quite outstanding opinion here some batteries have a pin in here which is a bit lower or which is a bit more inside and therefore you can experience these these contact issues unfortunately and in this video I would like to show you how to fix it all you need to do is actually to take your battery and take your needle I take this needle from a multi meat for my multimeter now and you go inside see carefully and now you move this plate a bit into this direction and then you turn your battery around like so ah that is not easy doing it in front of a camera and you move it back into this direction and now try to get into the back into the middle again like so I really hope you can see that properly and then screw the atomizer back on it let's check it I hope you can hear that so this is working in again so all you need to do is actually just erase that center pin a tiny bit with the needle or something like that but do it careful and then you on the safe side and that's actually it so your battery's probably not faulty it's just a little reconnection problem and that's it thank you very much for watching and I speak to you soon gyah", "7lwZkl0yBqA": "this is a fairly typical multimeter I'm going to show you how to use it to measure current multimeters come supplied with leads and one lead should always be plugged into this socket marked com4 common the leads are both just insulated copper wires but by convention we always plug the black lead intercom with any multimeter you need to look at the labels on the other sockets to see which one is appropriate for what you're trying to measure there's a fuse inside here and if you use the wrong socket it could blow or you could even destroy the multimeter on this multimeter there's just one voltage socket this one marked V however if you're going to measure current there's a choice if you've no idea of the size of the current and start here this socket on this setting lets me measure current up to 10 amps but nothing smaller than a hundredth of an amp if you go above 10 amps you could destroy the multimeter let's measure the current in this circuit a meters are always connected in series so I need to break the circuit and then complete it again with the ammeter in series the miners just means we have the opposite polarity 0.14 amps that's a hundred and 40 milliamps since this is below 200 milliamps I can measure it more precisely using one of the more sensitive ranges on the island on the multimeter in order to do this I need to move the red lead into this socket marked milliamps which is connected by a fuse which will blow if the current exceeds 200 milliamps let's measure the current again one hundred and thirty five point two milliamps this is on the 200 milliamp full scale deflection range if I move to the twenty milliamp range the current is too high so I get a 1 on the far left of the display but there's no harm done I just click to a higher range to get a reading the fuse will only blow above 200 milliamps if the milliamp ranges do not work at all I just get a zero then someone has blown the fuse and it needs to be replaced however the meter will still work as a voltmeter you", "3XqNgWs3hX0": "now Anacin the tablets thousands of physicians and dentists recommend for fast relief of pain of headache

it's taken almost six years but this weekend she arranged to have mr. Blanton Madison Shai biology teacher all to herself yes indeed this time I absolutely put my foot down it was just mr. Boynton and me and five hundred delegates to the teachers convention you see over the past weekend a special meeting was held in Evanston to help celebrate American education week I had persuaded mr. Conklin our beloved principal to send me along with mr. Boynton as Madison's representatives and Friday morning my landlady came into my bedroom just as I finished packing for the trip you know Connie it looks just like cowhide it is nice isn't it I borrowed it for mrs. Raths down the street hey you got everything packed honey I think so let's see the Nike Harriet Conklin loaned me is in and mrs. Conklin's negligee that's in your nylon stockings are in yes I've got my things all packed and just wait till you see the new suit I'm wearing for the occasion of course I won't be able to put that on until 5:15 today why not funny silly Eberhardt doesn't get home from work until then you're terribly excited about this weekend trip aren't you dear oh of course mrs. Davis this is quite an important convention I'll get an opportunity to exchange ideas and opinions with other people in my line of work I'll get an opportunity to see what's being accomplished as other schools what else will you get Connie I'll get all my expenses paid and a whack at mr. Bourne huh that would be nice you and mr. Boynton seeing strange places and strange faces together the strange places are alright but the strange faces can go to the races one thing that puzzles me knowing your relationship with mr. Conklin how did he happen you as a delegate well it's very simple mrs. Davis remember two weeks ago mr. Conklin got himself a new gray flannel suit yes indeed his wife Martha told me he spent a small fortune on it I'm glad it was a small fortune I spilled a small bottle of ink on it Monday you didn't he now has grey flannel pants and a very sporty blue jacket anyway on Tuesday he left his wristwatch on his desk and I accidentally brushed it to the floor while I was picking up some papers then when I bent down to get it I broke the crystal but a crystal is easily repaired not when you break it by putting your heels through the back of the watch Tommy I don't understand why did mr. Conklin pick you for the convention this weekend well I was just getting to that mrs. Davis you see mr. Conklin's buying a new pair of glasses this morning and he wants to give them a three-day head start sounds logical well I know another English teacher at Madison will be mighty disappointed that she's not going on this trip you mean miss Enright I do he's almost as sweet on mr. Boynton as you are and this weekend trip would be a wonderful opportunity for her to cut you out with him please mrs. Davis I just got up why talk about nightmares no more pencils no more books no more wait for me miss Brooke's why didn't you pick me up this morning you know my car's in the repair shop it snows mine yesterday when I started for home it happened what happened as soon as I stepped on the starter the exhaust pipe blew the rest of the car into Hirsch's meat market anyway I'm glad I caught you before you dropped into mr. Boynton's biology lab what made you think I was going to drop into the biology lab yo please miss Brooke's it's too early in the morning for quips yeah what I meant was I thought I could save you from a big disappointment oh that's all right I'm used to him by now I mean what kind of disappointment mr. Boynton isn't in school what's more he isn't coming to school today wha but we're supposed to leave from here for the convention yeah I know what miss Brooks and I I know how devastated you'll be by the news but mr. Boynton won't be able to go with his convention he's sick in bed sick in bed how do you know Harriet told me he called in a little while ago and left the message with one of the teachers but how can I leave town if mr. Boynton is sick he has no more relatives in this part of the world and I have who'll take care of him let me put your mind completely at ease miss Brooks Harriet and I can run errands for mr. Boynton besides I'm sure miss Enright will be glad to nurse him back to health Walter you couldn't have put my mind more at ease if you told me my train was going to be bombed not exactly smitten with Miss Ann right are you miss Brooke's well frankly Walter there isn't a lot of affection squandered between us she always speaks highly of you miss Brooks why just the other day miss Enright said the only reason she can't see a romantic attachment between mr. Boynton and yourself is because of the difference in your ages and Wright said that sure let's see now what were her exact words oh yeah I remember she said that in her opinion mr. Boynton was definitely old enough to be your kid brother well that makes my next step quite apparent did you excuse me Walter I'm going right over to the principal's office what for I've got to see a man about a cat I mean don't come any closer on this roof if you take one more step I'll call for help the world are you talking about mr. Conklin I've got my new glasses on Miss Brooks and I mean to protect them with my life your glasses are opposing firmly on your nose and I'm nowhere near you that is how it always starts you weren't near me when you spilled that ink on my final suit either or when you smashed my watch or last month when you dropped the typewriter on my toes last week when you closed the office door on my nose I meant to ask you about that mr. Carson with that door ever fixed you will be pleased to know I'm sure that thanks to your valued efforts I have become one of the poorest accident insurance risks in this part of the state I won't draw an easy breath until you're on the train this afternoon I presume you're packed and ready to go yes sir and I'm really looking forward to it this is the first convention I've attended since I represented Gordon high school six years ago that was a lot of fun well you are not going to this convention to have fun miss Brooks as Madison standard-bearer our school will be judged by your action always remember that oh I will mr. Carson you can depend on me sir I won't get myself thrown into jail this time you mean you were thrown into jail at your last convention Oh for the most absurd reason mr. Carson can you imagine being locked up for riding around on a motorcycle well that's hardly a jail offense that's exactly what I told the policeman besides he wasn't using it at the time anyway you took a policeman's motorcycle it was just a lark sir there was absolutely no reason for them to put that picture in the paper what picture a picture of me holding up a burlesque Queen and the drunk tank you can start unpacking at any time you are not going to the convention not going but mr. Conklin think of your new glasses my glasses we'll have to live dangerously like the rest of my person but if you don't send me sir who will you send well I haven't given it any thought have you any suggestion I haven't given it any thought either miss Enright might be just the person just pause barring do you think she'll relish the idea of going believe me mr. Carson when you tell her about it she'll be so happy she'll clap her paws and glee I'll get to my classroom well good morning miss Brooks oh good morning mr. Boynton oh wait till you hear the news I was just in mr. Carson's office mr. Boynton what are you doing up go right home and get back into bed at once dad what for I'm not sick you're not I never felt better in my life development this is Walter told me that Harriet said you were sick in bed Harry well I didn't talk to Harriet when I phoned the school this morning I thought I was going to be delayed at the biology supply house so I left that message was one of the teachers part teacher miss Enright I should have said which teacher she's a witch teacher if I ever thought you suppose she could have confused the words delayed with laid-up there's no confusion at all this is the result of careful calculations miss Enright knew that Harriet would tell Walter also that Walter would if he saw me and that's customary he'd almost be sure to tell me and then knowing what she would do or thinking she know what I would do she told Harriet what I later heard from Walter and then I did what she thought I'd do are you all right where are you speaking in such jerky sentences there's a very good reason mr. barnman I have just been completely taken in by a very jerky teacher friends if you suffer from acid indigestion I hope you didn't miss reading this wonderful news a headline that says new Mensa medically proven quickly rid stomach of gastric distress that headline is talking about new bison all mints doctors recommend by saddle mints because the bicycle medication acts at once to make painful acid harmless and give you fast five-way relief one speeds relief from gas to sweetens your breath free it was complete longer lasting relief than baking soda for relief stomach upset from too much eating drinking smoking five lets you sleep when acid indigestion strikes at night so don't suffer acid indigestion heartburn or gastric distress from excess acidity remember new mints medically proven quickly rid stomach of gastric distress and remember the name vice at all mints VI s o do L get vice at all mints for fast relief well when we sat down to lunch in the school cafeteria I told mr. barnman that I suspected miss Enright of deliberately saying he was ill so that I would withdraw and she could go in my place the first he refused to believe it ever but finally his sense of justice was so completely outraged but he seemed beside himself with fury and he violently shouted maybe it was all a misunderstanding I think you'd stay home from the convention even if I was sick in bed because I would that's why somebody would have to take care of you get your medicine fix your meals and see that you were made comfortable miss Brooks may I remind her that I'm not sick in bed oh I know that mr. barnman then would you mind not taking my pulse I need this hand to finish my wax beans that when people haven't any relatives in the place it's up to the people who think something of people to do something for the people they think something of maybe I should teach Spanish I know you're disappointed about not attending the convention miss Brooks but if you have any suggestions you'd like me to put before the meeting there's only one suggestion I'm worried about and that'll come from Miss Enright do you see that's funny what you're mentioning this end right she's heading for this table now well speak of the devil it's just the way she's wearing her hair mr. Boynton why aren't you home in bed sheets caught on fire you know yourself miss Enright that I only phoned to say that I might be delayed getting to school No oh I thought you said laid up you did now you see Miss Brooks it was in this understanding oh of course like the one Custer had with those red chaps oh now don't be a bad loser darling not that you are really I understand that you personally recommended me to mr. Canton for the position of second delegate from Madison High oh you did that miss Brooke's wish my mother had quit after my two older brothers were born do you mind if I join you at this table the cafeteria is quite crowded now not as crowded as this table right now sit down this end right I see you have your own sandwich now can I get you some water or a napkin or something oh go ahead Diamond Jim I'd love some water please mr. Boies very well I got some for all of us he's a great boy for a lot of things but you'll be happy to know darling that mr. Conklin told me of my selection is second delegate early in the day that's why I was able to get home during a free period pack of the leash and put on my new fall traveling suit do you like it it all depends how far you travel right we both know that you're going to the convention is my fault we also know that my not going is your fault do I make myself clear to me yes but I can't help wondering how much of you gets across to your pupils let's not spoil mr. Boynton's luncheon with a lot of female bickering you're right miss Enright I might as well be a good sport about it all's fair and you-know-what and war I guess huh here we are ladies here's some good old h2o greatest thing since water well I brought some coffee for us to do you think the suit I'm wearing is all right for our train trip today oh yes miss Enright looks fine it's a very provocative shade of green don't you think so Miss Brooks in my present mood it's puzzling I can't tell where her suit leaves off and my face begins I'm Jubilee miss Enright it is an interesting shade of green who knows you may blend in with your Pullman chair so well mr. Boynton won't be able to find you sorry let's be gay shall we drink up mr. Barney will knock that water cooler silly I've had plenty thanks I'm working on this beef stew right now if you ladies will excuse me I'm not much for conversation while I'm eating of course mr. Barton bon voyage what other clothes are you taking on the trip oh just my two good dresses as a matter of fact they're the only two I'd wear out of the house but I thought you had quite an extensive wardrobe oh yes I did but I gave loads of last year's stuff to charity I think the poor have to live to what a liberal viewpoint I'm sorry miss Enright I'd really like to let bygones be bygones I'm going to get myself a little dessert now may I bring you something well I could do with the peace of palm oh I'd be happy to do you with a piece of pie got something real nice where are you going miss Brooke's can I get something for you you keep that beef your only yards away from a first down leave it to me darling I'll fix you up fine hi miss Brooks I was happy to see that mr. Boynton wasn't sick enough to miss school today he's not sick at all Harriet was just a plot to get me to volunteer to stay home so Miss Enright could go to the convention in my place I suggested her to mr. Conklin myself and he took your suggestion hook line and stinker see I've got an idea that may still turn the tables I'm gonna get miss Enright a nice piece of pie a piece of pie because she played a dirty trick on you exactly let's see now what goes poorest with a green dress Oh miss Brooks you're going to present miss Enright with the pie but in several places why Harriet Conklin what an outrageous thought I'll just take this coconut cream pie I believe how about taking this piece to both of them sure then you can lose your balance easier and as you let it happens you can sing white Christmas we have an extremely poetic mind Oh Harriet there's no one at this counter to punch my food Jack will you please get it done for me I'll pick it up on my way out oh sure miss Brooks you go right in here thanks dear don't mention it I hope I wasn't too long I brought some pie back for both of you oh that was very thoughtful Miss Brooks no looks delicious oh yes it does I'll pass mr. Barton's piece over T in this book oh I think I can manage oh come on let me have it well if you insist I must have tripped how could you be so clumsy oh my goodness the pie is all over your on your suit not quite all over it mr. Boynton most of it splattered on the coat the skirts not touched thank goodness that's what I get for not keeping my head down I'll just dip a napkin in this water and maybe we can get some of that goo off your coat oh here let me try that's what I call teamwork terribly sorry miss Enright my no suit is completely ruined first pie on the coat and then coffee on the skirt it's like I always say what good's a piece of pie without a cup of coffee humor leaves me cold at this point miss Brooke's it's a good thing I had the foresight to pack my other dresses and leave them in my gym locker no it is indeed miss Enright you'd hardly have time to get new clothes this afternoon the train leaves at 5:45 well accidents will happen I apologize again miss Enright and now if you'll both excuse me I've got to practice a bit practice yes my work on the parallel bars has been very vertical I'll miss Rooke will return in a moment yes you can help Keep America Beautiful you can with scarcely any effort at all join the growing ranks of Americans who are making clean streets and highways their own business apart from the aesthetic value of beautiful streets and highways unlettered and - the all-too-familiar collection of tin cans broken bottles and similar debris there's another consideration litter not only is unsightly it's dangerous a sharp ragged edge of a can can cause a blowout so can a broken piece of glass blowouts can cause death and often have if you have been among the thoughtless many who litter our roads park sides picnic sites and open highways give this matter serious thought now and help America mend its ways keep in mind that many states have already instituted heavy fines for littering some in three figures and more states are getting tough on litterers every month it's going to be as expensive to get caught littering as speeding in many states it's more costly good citizenship demanded common-sense demands it safety demands it helped make ours a litter free country help in every way you can well at lunch I had done my best to prevent miss Enright from attending the teachers convention with mr. Boynton however to my disappointment I discovered one ruined dress doesn't mean a missed convention at least not when diehard daizy happened to have the rest of her clothes packed and waiting in her gym locker later that afternoon I received an urgent request to report to our principal's office are you think for me mr. Conklin yes miss Brooks I did I have just spoken with Miss Enright she it appears was foolhardy enough to have lunch with you did share the same table but fortunately she escaped without any serious bodily injury however she has been foster withdraws Madison's second delegate to the teachers convention in Evanston you mean she's not able to go miss Brooke when Miss Enright informed me that you would tip at her garments with a slab of coconut cream pie it didn't surprise me in the least but there's one thing that does puzzle me what's that mr. Conklin well if it isn't revealing too much of a trade secret miss Brooks would you kindly tell me how you managed to plop a second piece of cream pie on the dresses packed inside inside I guess when I get clumsy I just go hog-wild until they infringe upon school operations personal rivalries on the faculty are not my concern however there are two train tickets available for this trip I know it yes so two tickets and that our two delegates expected to the convention that's right two delegates expected two of them you know mr. Borden is one of the delegates all we need now is another one you're right mr. Kaplan you're so right you're the rightest thing since the Wright brothers won more delegates all we need yes mr. Carson get off my desk you're not going I have just made my selection for delegate number two who me you none other not only will the trip do me a world of good it will reflect prestige and credit upon Madison High as well however I don't want you to feel completely out of things miss Brooke Sall so I want you to type up these notes for me they contain some remarks I will make to the convention yes sir how would you like to be my guest for a little lunch it was a nice try good day look all things that happen miss Brooke's must be upset today you're talking to yourself I know I'm a very good listener yes I'm going in to talk to mr. Conklin for a moment mr. Conklin are you in trouble oh not at all I'd rather not mention why I'm seeing him until after the interview but if you'll wait right here miss books I think I'll have a pleasant surprise for you when I come out of his office surprised yes now wait right by that fire hose on the wall I'll just be a few minutes don't worry mr. Boynton unless the hose catches on fire I'll be here oh I'm glad you waited for me miss Brooke's this hose is doubled over exactly sixty two and a half times now what's the surprise well I knew how anxious you were to make this trip to Evanston so when Miss Enright withdrew I determined to prevail upon mr. Conklin to let you go as originally planned there are only two tickets available and mr. Conklin's using one of them himself I know that this Brooks but you're going anyhow I am yes I turned my ticket back to mr. Kondo of course he was a little timorous at first but when I pointed out how helpful you could be to him taking notes and typing and whatnot he agreed to have you accompany him to the convention what about you mr. binder oh don't worry about me I'll be busy as a bee over the weekend I'll probably go on a shopping tour with miss Enright you really must excuse me mr. boy huh this is the only traveling dress I own and I've got to fix it up right away fix it up what's wrong with it that's obvious it hasn't any coconut cream pie on it our Miss Brooke Starling new Vardhan transcribed with directed by Larry burns written by Al Lewis with the music of Wilbur hatch mr. Conklin was played by Gale Gordon others in tonight's cast were Jane Morgan Dick Crenna Bob Rockwell gloria mcmillan and Mary Jane Croft be sure to be with us next week for another comedy episode of our Miss Brooks now it's our miss Brooke starring Eve Arden you well over the years our Miss Brooks who teaches English at Madison High has had more than her share of difficulties with her principal mr. Conklin recently however their relations have improved yes my uncle and man feel a lot better actually that some things have been a bit smoother between mr. Coughlin than me in fact when I suggested the plan I had heard about to supplement our teaching with movies mr. Conklin gave me the money to try it out so until last week when the great experiment was to take place in one of my classes everything was going splendidly and in more ways than one because Thursday morning mr. Boynton was over at my house for breakfast my landlady was attending an early Club meeting so there were just the two of us I could sense that mr. Boynton felt the warm romantic implications of this domestic scene because his voice seemed choked with emotion when he said I wonder how long Joe palooka will be champ whining just a little Abner little Abner he's been staring at me from the other side of that newspaper for the past ten minutes oh oh pardon me miss Brooks reading the paper was rather rude I guess it's just that I feel so at home here I didn't think you'd mind oh I really don't miss turbine that's just the way I want you to feel good I haven't had this sort of breakfast since I was home with mother well have you ever thought that you might enjoy a breakfast like this every day mr. bunny course I have Miss Brooks many times but Dad needs are too much from on to come down here right what I had in mind how's your latest project at school working out miss Brooke's I don't know yet miss button the first film the Lady of the lake was shown to my English class yesterday you don't know how it worked out no I had to do something for mr. Conklin during that hour so I let the kids run the picture themselves will know how it was received when Walter Denton picks us up in a few minutes all films can be a big help to all teachers while other schools have been showing movies in their classrooms for years I wonder why mr. Conklin would never allow it at Madison before he hates popcorn David is very fond of the idea though in fact she's showing a film at her clubs breakfast this morning she rented it from the same place I did what pictures she ran a little number called cheering heap at big Billabong Australia what's it about it's about cheering sheep at big Billabong so the ladies and mrs. Davis's club shearing sheep in Australia why should that be perfect for the ladies and mrs. Davis club there are some pretty woolly ladies and mrs. Davis's 500c water come on in the door is open I'm anxious to hear how your audio-visual experiment was received by the English class if past performances mean anything I know exactly what happened five minutes after I left the room what they left the room pleasant surprise greetings to my two favorite faculty members the fairest of the fair and the brainiest of the brawny shoulders that makes me look hey where's the effervescent mrs. Davis this morning she's fizzing at a ladies club breakfast oh that must be the same one mom and mrs. Conklin are attending Walter were both anxious to hear how that audio-visual experiment worked out yesterday yes how was the Lady of the lake received Walter oh great miss Brooks unfortunately the sound part of the projector didn't work but this class made up for that oh you never heard such whistling in your life whistling the Lady of the lake what did she do come out exactly Miss Brooks you see the title on the can the picture came in said the lady of the lake alright but the picture turned out to be something called sirens of the screen past and present we were two o'clock in the afternoon and every cell in the class was late for dinner last night it's only a 15 minute short I know but we read it 23 times you don't mean that yeah and we stopped the projector for 10 minutes every time we got the Marilyn Monroe hell afternoon I planned for next week miss Brooks a little epic called the teacher dies at dawn Johnson heard about this yet Walter oh I don't know miss Brooks I hope he hasn't I know what this project means to you miss Brooks well cheer up mr. Borden even if he has heard about it we can still get a picture of the Lady of the lake what do you mean I may drown myself now if you will be seated miss Brooke's I'll come directly to the boy yes sir as an experiment in audio-visual education I gave you not only permission but also 15 dollars to rent a projector and film of the poem the Lady of the lake something go wrong with Miss Brooks when I did so I had no idea that the Lady of the lake would turn out to be Marilyn Monroe after Williams would have been much more appropriate I can explain this MacLaine explain this thing when you wanted this film you told me it was Sir Walter Scott's poem presented against a background of Scottish sea and the Terr only scotch in that entire picture was in a glass in Peter Burroughs hair and you run the picture mr. Carson five times I that it is I ran it through a few times to convince myself that what I was seeing was true sirens of the screen indeed I've already heard from mr. stone this morning and he was furious it seems that five parents have already complained to him about it he blames the whole thing on me but why you sir it was my idea I know but I took credit for it this is a mistake on the part of the company institutional pictures it probably won't happen again in another 10 years we're all entitled to one mistake aren't we sometimes when I think of you miss Brooke's that is the only thing that keeps me going but I told mr. stone it was all a mistake and I also told him we had another film in case he wanted to reassure himself on the subject matter of the pictures where sure but sir we haven't another picture and including the projector they cost fifteen dollars to rent that is your problem miss Brooke's you got us into this thing and you are going to get us out of it in any event mr. stone said he wouldn't bother to come over unless the refer the complaints however if there are he said heads would roll Osgoode constant principal speaking who is she's right here now it's for you miss probe for me sir hello hello Connie mrs. Davis oh hello mrs. David I just called to give you all the picture I showed if the ladies club breakfast turned out I ain't bald credit for the idea to you of course and we told the ladies that this was the identical sort of picture he owned it Nelson hi I see well how did cheering sheep at big Billabong turn out Oh Oh terrific once the showgirls dressing room or even more since well where were the sheets you know it was all about a chorus girl however none of the ladies seem to mind that is none except mrs. stone mrs. stone was there what did she say mrs. Davis oh not at all mrs. Davis my tongue always sticks to the roof of my mouth in the morning I'll meet you later goodbye what was that all about Miss Brooks mr. Conklin did mr. stone really say heads would roll if there was another complaint that's exactly what he's hit miss Brooks what about it nothing sir only I wonder how we'll both look when we're ten inches shorter I told mr. Boynton about my predicament in the school cafeteria at lunch time let's see if I've got it straight miss Brooks you must have another film here to show mr. stone when he arrives this afternoon or the entire project goes right out the window followed swiftly by me and the cost of renting a new film and projector is $15 which I've got to get somewhere where isn't mr. Conklin giving you anything yes two hours in which to dig it up well you can count on me for part of the $15 oh really mr. Wein what part two dollars and 35 cents here's a thirty-five cents now well thanks mr. vine but where's the $2 oh just a second till I take off my shoe tell me you've got two dollars in your shoe well no I've only got one dollar in my shoe where's the other dollar in my hatband make a nervous wreck out of a holdup man I do appreciate your this from mr. boy oh hello Harry I hope I'm not interrupting anything but mr. Boynton what you doing with your shoe all he's just airing out his money Harry well first daddy asked me to tell you to be sure to be in his office with the new film by 3:30 because that's mr. stones due to arrive and secondly knowing the position you're in I went around to all the girls and took up a collection for you I'm beginning to feel like a charity case remember the old proverb miss Brooke's pride goeth before a fall bad I know us and at this point I'm not going to turn down anything I knew you needed $15 so I canvassed about 30 girls miss Brooke's I told him to come up as much as they could how much did you collect 80 cents I've also got a dollar of my own I want to lend you oh no really Harriet I wouldn't dream at all but mister all right dear view and sis where is the dollar I'll give it to you as soon as I go down to my locker after lunch the dollars in your locker not exactly Miss Brooks but what that's the only place I can remove the stocking I'm wearing over it the wallet industry depended on this school to go broke thanks a lot Harry all right here's the money miss perks I did the very best I could I knew all the precincts hadn't been heard from would you check up a collection to Walter oh yes sir I went around all the fellas in your English Lit class miss Brooks and I told them you needed 15 iron men for a new film and since they'd all seen sirens of the screen this was one little way of expressing their gratitude and how much did you collect 65 cents got a bigger business with Lady of the lake oh that's not at all I want to lynch a dollar of my own which I've kept for just such an emergency banks were all there where is it well you know that good-luck charm I wear around my neck with my mother's picture in it yes oh that's not my mother it's George Washington people than meets the eye now let's see mr. Boynton has two dollars and 35 cents for me Harriet 180 and Walter a dollar sixty-five that comes to approximately six dollars then I've got another couple of dollars of my own well I didn't think you had any money miss Brooks what did you got two dollars remember when I went to the dentist last week yes well I stashed two dollars away in the temporary filling oh I'm dreadfully sorry miss Brooks but institutional pictures can't accept eight dollars on a projector and film which runs for 15 but mr. Gibson it was your mistake in the first place you sent us sirens of the screen past and present when I'd ordered the Lady of the lake from your salesmen I think his name was Blake oh yeah we've had nothing but trouble with that man our manager wouldn't raise his salary so out of sheer spite he switched any number of films on us before he quit I'd like to help you but we have a strict 24-hour ruling and you've had your film for several days you just have to tell your organization that if what what is it by the way a ladies club social service group union I teach at Madison high school for you what why our biggest rental is two schools you showed sirens of the screen to a high school class for the 10-minute stop over at Marilyn Monroe looks like a very fair-minded person I'll tell you what I'll do you keep the $8 knowledge you have the new film and projector for nothing well I'll make it four films for nothing now get above the rebels entirely I I'll give you a year supply of films free if you get your school to forget this incident well I'll go in ten dollars for yourself well miss Brooke's aren't going to answer me I'm doing good enough well just give me a good film to show the head of our school board when he comes to Madison this afternoon and we'll call it square oh you're the salt of the earth I have just the thing for the occasion the Board of Education at work don't you think it's perfect I suppose those you like fantasy well when mr. Gibson agreed to rectify his mistake and give me a new film to show mr. stone it seemed that my troubles were just about over at 3:00 that afternoon we were getting everything ready and mr. Compton's office well the projectors all set up Miss Brooks all we have to do with mr. Conklin mr. stone get here is turn the switch and run the film yeah this office ought to be a perfect projection room is it the way I fixed the shades no life can get in through the windows at all oh you've done a beautiful job Walter there's only one thing that bothers me this sound on this projector doesn't work if mr. Conklin in the room nobody will notice the difference we don't got a few minutes before daddy gets here well we run the film through once for the four of us good idea Harriet let's sit down yeah but there are only two chairs in this room where are the four of us going to sit we can worry about that when the lights are out what are you talking about what Walter means is that he and Harriet can share the big comfortable chair that mr. Conklin keeps for visitors but what about the two of us we can divide this narrow one and don't look so panicky we can either show the film or just turn out the lights and wait until mr. Conklin there's a stone get here just turn out the lights what good lad do that answer your question maybe we better run the film I was afraid you'd see it that way all right Walter turn off the desk light let's get started yes ma'am there we are yes I can't see a thing where are you Miss Brooks are you seated yet after you mr. Barton I'll sit on the edge of the chair nearest the projector switch now are we all set Walter Robert I want a magnificent view of the Rock of Gibraltar I feel as if I could reach out and touch it uh you're staring at my chin this Brook you're leaning rather close to me how nice of you to notice well we've missed the title but we know it's about the Board of Education that worked oh look at that sign by the side of the road it says you are now entering Las Vegas Nevada oh it's probably all about the Las Vegas Board of Education I hope you're right of course I am there they are now all working around the table nice table mr. Boynton this is a picture about gambling there's been another terrible mistake turn off the projector it was Miss Brooks well I'm trying to this the switch is stuck pull the plug out of the wall I don't know where the wall plug is with the lights on logger turn on the desk lamps Oh mr. Boynton can find the plug Walter Walter do you hear me they help find it in the dark mr. Barnes I'll try oh good you found it going on in here mr. Coughlin Oh a just a moment sir I'll turn on the light no no never mind the lights miss Brooke's since you've apparently started your new film the Board of Education at work I'd like to have a look at it before mr. stone gets here here and sit in my chair sir oh where will you sit I'll stand in front of the screen it is a very good picture mr. Cockrell stop stop babbling please I'll just settle myself in this comfortable chair on the other side of the projector please spirit me you just got on my knees daddy and your little heavy Harriet what are you talking about I got if I can hold the both of you where are you he's between the devil and the deep blue sea well turn on those wall like pointin yes sir haha Harriette I want you intention to leave this room at once through my in office please and I'll speak to you both later very well daddy mr. Conklin appearances are very often deceiving and I want you to know that Harriet was in no way responsible for what happened I'll take the full blame shirt was all my fault and I insist that you let me accept the entire responsibility for this Oh don't ought to be here any minute now and we can get rolling again at least our heads can Oh baby come in oh good afternoon mr. serve good afternoon all good well mr.

Gibson the man who rented this the film well I'll do anything to rectify my mistake miss Brooks why I'll even I oh hello mr. stone I owe you you now mr. town yeah he's evidently mistaking me for somebody else oh no sir don't you remember when that friend of yours got married last month you rented two films from me for a smoker you gave him well I remember it distinctly because one of the pictures called all the hubbub today sirens of the screen past and present always that sold well for your information when I fly stood on the screen that night it turned out to be the Lady of the lake so mr. so you are going to call my moral laxity to the attention of the Board of Education oh you you don't really think I meant that do you ours good ha not on your tintype I've already if anything it's mr. Gibson who should be brought before the board oh that would be a waste of time mr. stone a waste of time the way mr.

Davis I've been looking forward to this for a long time I know you have dear ever since mr.

Boynton is spending his vacation at Crystal Lake so what mr. Boynton spending his vacation at Crystal Lake as far as I'm concerned he can go his way and I'll go my way where are you going on your vacation County Crystal Lake it just happens that my picking out Crystal Lake for a vacation was merely a coincidence as a matter of fact I simply took a map of some surrounding resort towns and stuck a pin in it and the pin landed on Crystal Lake who knows I was afraid to look but Walter Denton is coming over to help me with my bags this morning and I'd appreciate it if you don't mention mr. Boynton in front of him why not Connie Walter knows you're fond of mr. Boynton well I'm fond of Walter to mrs.

Boynton he's still vacationing up there you know he is well you might not believe this Walter but the fact that mr. Boynton happens to be at Crystal Lake in the beaver lodge in room 124 is certainly news to me not tell the truth miss Brooke's Chauncey he's been away his mr. Boynton called you much he hasn't called me anything I couldn't repeat mixed company oh you mean has the telephone well to be perfectly honest Walter mr. Boynton did phoned me about a week ago but I didn't enjoy the conversation as much as I should have why not well mr. Boynton told me that the desk clerk at beaver lodge mr Turner was quite a Snooper and he used to listen in on the guests telephone calls gosh that's pretty hard to believe in a nice hotel like that I didn't believe it myself until mr. Turner cut in on us to deny the whole thing Wow turn it or no Turner you oughta phone mr. Boynton and tell him you're coming up today not me Walter I want to surprise him you but you haven't spoken to him in a week he might have checked out checked out sure but even if he hasn't you don't have to give the surprise away just tell him you call to pass the time of day don't even mention that you're driving up well right that's my towel stretch Snodgrass miss Brooks he said he was gonna come over and say goodbye to you oh I'm quite flattered stretches Madison's most brilliant athlete physically that is right come in spread y'all go help mrs.

DeWitt Oh mr. Norman or miss Enright yeah of course I didn't mention the one person whose dismissal would affect me the most and whose is that mine I couldn't afford to stay out of work for any length of time it would work a considerable hardship on my family they'd have to send me even more money than they do now goodness see here you talk anyone would think you were some kind of helpless instead of a brilliant handsome personable capable scientist who me yes you that's the way you should consider yourself always what do you suppose would happen if you lost your job here at Madison do you think you'd have to pack your clothes in the bindle and become a hobo do you think you have to shuffle through life like this poor coming toward us well no but I should say you wouldn't why you or excuse me mr.

Conklin and Harriet do the laundry that's us all for one and one for all in Union Earth strike old friends are the best friends six Emperor Sophie suds Armus trucks will return in a moment our Miss Brooks certainly does have her problems but let's face it we all do they may not be as hilarious as hers but we've got them for instance it's not possible for most of us to be at the scene of important happenings and world affairs maybe once or twice in a lifetime mr. and mrs. average citizen will figure in a newsworthy experience beyond that few of us participate in the world events that make the history books this makes it impossible for the average man or woman to keep up with world affairs without help the question of where to go for reliable help has been solved by CBS News when eyewitness observers all around the globe men who can fly without notice from their strategically central stations to wherever the news is happening CBS News has complete coverage day and night throughout the week you can come and go as you please plan whatever plans you will and always be sure that when you want to catch up with history CBS News will catch you up on its earliest regularly scheduled news program solve your problem and keeping up with the news of the world by making CBS radio you're listening post while due to a series of circumstances everyone is convinced that mr. Conklin is about to be fired and is practically destitute so in true Musketeers spirit they have rallied to his aid by securing all the laundry business in the neighbourhood and bringing it to his house oh it's awfully nice of you to help out like this but I can't help wondering what mother will think when she gets back from her shopping trip it'll be a nice surprise for her Harriet we've got enough business here to tide mr.

Burnham I did I also put some up in the living room we'll need every inch of space we can get stretch is still out getting more bundles I had no idea daddy was in such dire straits KO but with friends like you nobody could ever consider themselves poor a friend in need is a friend indeed your problem is our problem if I've said it once I've said it twice six Emperor soapy suds yeah so you see Osgood the social duties that go with the position of assistant supervisor are most important is well that's why I brought you to my home mr. stone I want you to see for yourself what a charming background for entertaining mrs.

Boynton to see a great deal of me of course and 16 by 24 is the largest size if a bit outside of wallpaper yes good morning miss Willa a good good morning to Madison's most beauteous faculty member oh hello kids miss Brooke's how did you like that photographer Walter sent you to is Laverne of Hollywood the most well his prices certainly are still I'm not complaining and I'm thankful to you Walter was sending me to him but do me a big favor will you don't under any circumstances tell anyone about the gift I'm giving mr. Boynton also let's keep your mr. Laverne strictly to ourselves don't tell a soul not a female soul hmm oh yes and fear not miss Brooks your secret is sealed up in the chambers of my mind where it will remain solidly entombed like give either like like the answers to my last English quiz yes don't tell anybody no I don't worry Miss Brooks I wouldn't dream of it oh don't look now but I think I see Miss Enright approaching on your starboard bow well batten down my hatches and prepare to abandon ship I wonder what she wants well besides mr. Boynton I haven't the faintest idea huh oh you'll soon find out yeah come on Harriet we gotta get to class all right Walter see you later miss Brooke bye Harriet well good morning miss Brooks and how is my dear friend this morning if I can find one I'll ask her Oh you have such a charming sense if you move gay effervescent bubbling like a slightly moss-covered fountain well it's been nice chatting chatting with you but I must be on my way to class oh well just mount miss Brooks I stopped you for a reason it concerns mr. Boynton for mr. Boyer yes you see I have a delightful surprise for him as the reward for the honor he's just won really now Miss Brooks the only reason I'm discussing the question of gifts with you is to prevent us from both giving him the same thing oh well there isn't a chance of that I assure you no I suppose not I'm presenting him with a framed photograph of myself taken by Laverne of Hollywood and that's something you could never possibly have thought of unless we were sisters out of the same roof what are you here from mom says what you can't be serious you mean you intend getting in the same thing that's what I mean but where on earth did you get the idea and drop dead Walter Denton yes yes as a matter of fact Walter did give me the idea I've already had my picture taken I'm supposed to pick it up this afternoon so I'm afraid you'll have to oh I'm supposed to pick mine up this afternoon to so I'm afraid you'll have to very well darling I see I'll have to convince you to back out the hard way here you may look at the proof of the picture I'm giving in certainly it must be pretty awful whoa I don't look too bad in the French bathing suit do idea I don't know where is the suit oh yes there it is I thought at first it was a speck of dust then right this isn't fair besides mr. Boynton would never display such a photograph unless it had a calendar under it I was healing your lover darling men being men and now what did you say you were getting into you I don't know I may just decide to hop up on his Bureau myself well it was quite a blow to hear that this Enright was going to surprise mr. Borden with a photograph of herself at the same time I was all morning I thought of how to prevent it but without success so in order to be certain my lunch hour would be free for additional thought at noon I took every possible precaution to avoid passing our beloved principal's office I walked down the back stairs past the women's lockers through the cellar then through the furnace room up the stairs to the furnace room door which faced the rear of the cafeteria as I opened the door quickly it landed against something soft you can help me up now if you want to mr. Conklin oh my goodness sir I'm terribly sorry but why were you shaving all the way back here I wasn't shaving miss Brooke's my face was just propelled into my custard pie Hey I was carrying a tray of food a tray of food but I don't see any food how could you thanks to you I'm sitting in most of it mistress was your mother ever frightened by a Keystone ha really mr. Conklin I'm terribly sorry but I had no idea oh never mind what's done is done I suppose I can brush most of this stuff off I wanted to have a word with you anyway but hardly under these circumstances now to be brief it has come to my attention that a few of my teachers are considering patronizing a certain notorious photographer in town and notorious photographer yes this man Laverne has been making his living up to now in Hollywood taking cheesecake pictures of cinema starlets such a man can have nothing but a corrosive and demoralizing effect on the community I'm sure mr. stone the head of the Board of Education would concur in this opinion how do you know saying I asked him therefore henceforth mr. Laverne studio will be considered out of bounds to Madison's personnel and any teacher or pupil found on or near his premises will be ruthlessly dealt with is that clear mr. oh yes sir and I won't detain you from the lunch any longer and please pass the word along to any teachers you meet in the cafeteria who have not already heard my edict but aren't you coming in for lunch today sir with you in the same cafeteria I wouldn't dare well see you later then well hello miss Brooks oh hello mr. Barr huh I was hoping I run into you down here today I wanted to treat you for lunch sort of celebrate the award I won well mr. Boynton how thoughtful is that the lunch and the bundle you're carrying in the bundle oh no no miss Brooks that's some track pants for later I intend giving my mother a photograph of myself bye Laverne of Hollywood that's why I'll need these track pants for my photograph you're posing in just track pants that's right my mother always liked my athletic pictures at college so I thought I'd pose for one like that now I wanted to be a complete surprise don't we all mm-hmm well aren't you taking an awful chance after mr. Conklin's edict well because Laverne studio is out of bounds I've thought about it miss Brooke but since I'm already committed out my chances when are you going down to had this photograph taken well I have an appointment with Laverne is four o'clock this afternoon for this afternoon yes the only time he has open four weeks some woman is supposed to come in to pick up her picture a little before that and I'm supposed to follow this woman I know you were supposed to follow this woman for the past six years with you sure picked a heck of a time to start but miss Brooke's the only reason I came into your classroom was to explain what happened the extruder Vern paid me 10% but you see older it's a little late for explanations by now because of your recommendations everyone in school is having his picture taken as a surprise gift for someone else but worst of all because of your galloping jaws mr. Conklin has declared Luverne out of bounds oh I didn't mention him to mr. Conklin Laverne sent him a special calendar of his beautiful girls for Christmas and mr. Conklin tore it up are you certain of course I'm certain I was in his office when he took it out of his wall safe this morning and tore it up it figures well perhaps I have misjudged you slightly but my particular problem is to prevent miss Enright from giving mr. Boynton her picture well I think I've got a way to eliminate miss Enright quick clean and easy yeah I thought of that too but she refuses to eat the cafeteria food yummy it's nothing like that miss Brooks but I know she can't pay for her picture until the first of the month and if you can convince mr. Laverne that she's a bad credit risk when you pick up your picture he may not give miss Enright hers who's your study teacher Lucretia Borgia hey that might work at that of course it will well does that prove that your interests are uppermost in my mind miss Brooks and that my plugs for mr. Laverne were not only for personal gain but also mirror boyish enthusiasm Walter your boyish enthusiasm stopped when you traded your celluloid raffle to the baby next door for his gold teething ring later that afternoon in spite of mr. Conklin's edict I was in Luverne studio when he showed me my portrait I told him how happy I was with the result well I'm delighted that you're pleased with my work miss Brooks and I hope the others who were coming in this afternoon are equally satisfied oh you're expecting miss Enright aren't you oh yes do you know what oh yes your dog Skippy isn't rippy oh that's just a friendly little nickname that the loan company gave her ha ha ha good old Skippy always the first to skip a payment hmm skips baby yes but she's so wonderful you know she never has less than a half a dozen men chasing after well she must be quite popular they're all from the collection agency oh I think perhaps I'd better hold on to miss Enright's picture until who's that oh we're probably mr. Boynton he's also a teacher I've got to get out of here my picture is a surprise for him he mustn't see me here quick where can I hide where where can I hide oh goodness this is exciting I feel just like we're being raided over there Miss Brooks that door leads to my dark room you can stay there until I get rid of mr. Boyd is that right through that door no mr. Boynton just in time I see mr. Laverne this picture you're taking out me is to be for my mother and I'd like a relaxed informal poll Oh nothing else but would you like one of those studious shots you know pipe in mouth and that dreamy look in the eyes or would you prefer to pose bear in a leopard skin leopard skin oh you look just snazzy oh no no thanks miss Laverne what I want oh goodness that must be somebody else from the school from the school holy smokes your place is out of bounds for us I got to get out of here now where can I hide the what is that door lead to the dark room but uh never mind that's good enough oh it was a close shave oh thank gosh it's dark in here why'd it be completely dark if it weren't for that dim purple light over the basin anybody got a slingshot this hurts Oh whoo gosh you startled me what are you doing here I just know that streetcar gag won't hold up well you see mr. Barton no I probably the same reason I'm here well I think that's mr. Conklin out there now Miss Brooks undoubtedly checking up on us yeah goodness knows how long we'll have to stay huddled together in this stuffy dark room maybe half an hour or an hour or two our 12 hour a week a week or maybe mr. Laverne will forget about us and go on a vacation we may be here quite a while yeah I suppose we might as well do something while we're waiting for mr. Conklin to leave yeah we might as well night away we might as well do that we certainly might might as well know what it'd be something for two people to do together in a dark room two guesses and I can't stay puckered forever I've got it of course why didn't I think of it before the ideal thing yes mr. Bergman will develop some of the burns pictures for her revoltin development is maybe I better take a peek outside and see what's going on no mr. Boynton let them lead their lives and will lead ours just one little peek it miss Enright if I let you have the picture are you certain you can pay by the first of the month oh absolutely you may even get your money sooner if Miss Brooks pays me the $300 she owes me Miss Brooks owes you $300 Skippy a Miss yes and I just hate as that poor bankrupt soul for the money just isn't like me to hit anyone when she's down not when you can kick her in the head instead heavens mission right I had no idea miss Brooklyn who's that probably someone from your school altered ethnicity number but this place is out of bounds Oh quick where can I hide well I'm having splendid success with the dark yes that's it is that where the Dorney put missing right my goodness it's dark in here where's the light in this place oh that's not a light switch you're turning miss Enright that's my nose Brooks are you doing here I was doing fine until you butted in hello miss Enright hi mr. Boynton quietly what I think I hear mr. Conklin's voice mr. Conklin Oh if he finds me here I'll be fired well don't worry there's a civil service exam for County dog catcher coming up you are if we're all quiet for a minute maybe I can take a look outside no no mr. lover and I look ridiculous posing in that leopard skin but mr. Conklin you said you wanted an unusual portrait of yourself didn't you well of course but I prefer to pose in my own skin if you don't mind very well who's that whoo-hoo-hoo good grief I must be seen in here this place is out of bounds we're gonna hide where well where does that door lead to it's a fraternity room they're standing room only in their darkest instant our that's it the dark room Jacqueline butcher - thank you goodness this door must be automatic it opened up for me just as I approached it just lucky none of my faculty know I'm here because hello mr. Conte hello Miss Brooks they ever heard about it I could hardly bear to look any one of them Scotland hello mr. Boynton in the face besides they'd have so much on me I probably never live it down as long mr. Carr hello miss Enright as I remained at Madison they'd hold it over me do everything in their power to force me to do whatever they wanted and there's nothing I could possibly hello miss brooks mr. Vardhan miss I haven't been talking to myself no but you soon will be but this what are all of you doing here oh just a moment sir I think I hear mr. stones voice out there mr. stone Oh what'll I do I'm ruined what can I tell him if he finds me in here we might tell him mr. laverne's hobby is collecting schoolteachers oh what's the use I couldn't stand the embarrassment of having mr. stone find me I'm going out there like a man and give myself up oh no don't do it there mistress oh good Heaven holy catfish oh I don't know I think mr. stone looks cute in that leopard skin river reckoning by Arthur hallsburg and loserman with the music of Wilbur hatch mr. Conklin was played by Gale Gordon others in tonight's Gasper Jane Morgan dick Crenna Bob Rockwell and Whitfield Mary Jane Croft and Frank Nils be sure to now it's our Miss Brooke starring Eve Arden well what if you romances have started between faculty members teaching at the same school but for our Miss Brooks who teaches English at Madison High School romance is a problem it's really two problems problem number one is the object of my affections mr. Phillip Boynton biology teacher he's so bashful he won't even shave himself unless he's wearing a tie and problem number two is the strict anti fraternization rule laid down by Madison's beloved principal Osgood Conklin of course mr. Boynton devised a very effective method of getting around this rule he suggested that we stop seeing each other entirely however I immediately use my power of veto and before he could take it to the general assembly we convened for two dates away from the school the last date occurred on Wednesday night and Thursday morning at breakfast my landlady asked for details now tell me everything that happened last night coming we went to a movie mrs. Davis and and we came home and fold up your program the recital is over pass the cream please but what did mr. Boynton say what did he do nothing nothing pass the cream I can't understand that man here he has date after date with a girl who's intelligent attractive wholesome chic she charming and what does he do about it nothing past the cream oh it's not that he isn't fond of me mrs. Davis but he's been worried lately about someone very near and dear to him a relative yes his pet frog mcdougal it seems with the cold weather coming on Mac is very prone to laryngitis and there are no heating facilities for the cages the least the school should do is put some heating equipment in there why doesn't mr. Boynton ask mr. Conklin for it because mr. Boynton is almost as terrified of mr. Conklin as he is of me he wouldn't dare ask him for anything then you've got to do it Connie don't you see if you get the things that he needs mr. Boynton won't be so preoccupied and worried when he's out on dates with you well it's worth a try I guess now if I can remember where I left it I'll put my face on and get ready for Walter Denton he's driving me to school again you mean your car is still in the repair shop yes the mechanic called yesterday and said it would take a bit longer this time it seems they're having a little trouble with the motor what kind of trouble they've misplaced it I'm glad you pick me up early today Walter I've got to stop in mr. Conklin's office before my first class what a depressing way to start off the day that's right I don't have to see our beloved principal this morning I'm low enough already low yeah I feel gloomy er than a schoolteachers personality present company excepted of course of course what's the reason for your blue mood did Harriet Conklin give you the go-by oh no ma'am no Harriet and I are still an item it's Stretch Snodgrass who's preying on my mind maybe that's because he hasn't got one of his own I know he's never been exactly a beacon of brilliant scholastically miss Brooks but on that gridiron he's always been a tower of strength up to last week that is what happened last week well you saw the game last Saturday didn't you see what he did sure he picked up a fumble and ran 85 yards with it cuz I couldn't quite figure out why I was the only one in my section who was cheering he ran the wrong way first beat us on that one numbskull play now I've stretched doesn't perk up we'll lose our big game to Clay City next week what do you think is the cause of this change Walter I know what it is the big goofs in love in love yeah and the trouble is he won't tell anybody who the girl is oh wait a minute you know he's very fond of you Miss Brooks maybe you could straighten him out you know have a talk with him and I'd like to help Walter but I've got a more pressing problem this morning that's why I'm going straight to mr. Conklin's office well what could possibly be more pressing than Madison's winning the Battle of the year my winning the Battle of Boynton's lab daddy why are you so despondent because of our coaches report on Snodgrass that's why he's been playing abominably and the coach knows the reason the big Moose is in love in love oh but isn't there something we can do daddy if the word I'd be doing it you don't think I want to lose this game to Jayson grills place it in Lincoln Pope's do you course not daddy I know mr. brildor archrival he's worse than that he's just no way out but no way I could possibly feel any worse than I do right now have you thought of Miss Brooks daddy you just showed me away miss Brooks might be able to help if there's one person in this school whom stretch admires and respects it's her maybe she could pull him out of his doldrums so you might have something there at there as soon as she gets to school hi come in oh pardon me mr. Conklin if you're busy I'll come back later not at so miss Brooke Harriet was just leaving for a class run along okay daddy see you later miss Brooke's by Harriet sit down Saddam want you over here by my desk that's the most comfortable chair maybe you don't know who I am sir yeah it's miss Brooks I knew it's Miss Brooks and I'm delighted that you dropped in to see me this morning you are well then it won't be so difficult to ask a favor you want the favor of me miss Bruce yes I do sir haha how isn't that a coincidence I want a review one hand washes the other good way as any to get them both clean what is your favor mr. Caffyn well as you know Madison's big football game with Clay City is to be played next week yes sir you are also aware of my intense rivalry with Jason brill their principal yes sir but what do you want of me mr. Carson well it's very simple miss Brooke perhaps you've heard about Snodgrass running the wrong way last Saturday mm-hmm now you know that nobody with half a brain could make a mistake like that twice except perhaps Snodgrass that idiot woman a few rows behind me who kept cheering him Thanks Saturday I'll keep my mouth shut what do you think I can do about stretch mr. Conklin well you may be able to straighten him out you see Miss Brooks he's been even worse in practice this week than in that game last Saturday and the coach seems to think it's because he's in love that's what Walter Denton thanks to does Denton know with whom no sir nobody does exactly and that's where you come in in his lame brain dunce like way Snodgrass admires you greatly he has his reasons I'm sure we lamebrain dunces are pretty clannish I meant what you seem to be the logical person to find out just what little baggage is turning Snodgrass his head and I use the word advisedly and if I find out what's in then your natural feminine instincts will come to the fore you will devise some way to circumvent the activities of the aforementioned that have baggage now then what is the favor you see well mr. Boynton needs some new equipment for the biology lab and he's too timid to ask for it he shall have it what kind of equipment for some heating facilities for one thing and more comfortable cages for his frogs and guinea pigs it's done anything else else well now that you mention it I could use a new desk and some new window shades in my room I also would like to have it painted the nice cheerful shade of green the miss Brooke you are speaking with Osgood Conklin nutsy agha car well that's the way you feel about it sir maybe stretching his girl should be left alone after all my nice cheerful shade of green it is now you're sure you know what to do miss bro leave it to me mr. Conklin when I get through with him stretch will not only check his baggage he won't call for her for 30 days well I took advantage of a free period I had right before lunch and sought out Madison's moon I'd mastered on Stretch Snodgrass I found him near the water fountain in the hall he was slouching against the wall and seemed half asleep but when I approached him he snapped to attention hmm hi hello stretch I hope I'm not keeping you up I mean I hope I'm not keeping you from any of your classes but I would like to talk to you for a few minutes oh you I keep me from knocking Miss Brooks frenchclasses of the place which I'm supposed to have been that pretty soon from now but my French can wait at least until your English catches up that's what I wanted to talk to you about was your football playing you know yourself that you're not playing as well as you used to and a lot of your friends around here are beginning to worry about it why should they worry gosh just cuz I don't play over my head in every game everybody gets all upset this season's for nothing but practice practice practice look I can't go on like that we'll just all work and no play after all well ain't no Auto matron no Auto matron you know a mechanical man the kind they call a Robert sides little relax never hurt nobody mmm the stretch why should a young boy like yourself be yawning in the middle of the morning well Tory couldn't have thought of a better answer if I tried all day a new girlfriend thinks relaxin is good for me she won't even let me quit rumba ring and take her home till 1:00 in the morning we're going on like that for the last two weeks who is this new girlfriend stretch whoa no you thought no I don't want you don't get Judy's name on me I promised the people the secret well that's your privilege if you don't want me to know Judy's name I'm not gonna know Judy's name that's all there is to that Judy what gosh I didn't even want that part of her name to get out put it to slept look miss Brooke's you didn't want me to break a promise would you perv and play listen stretch even if you enjoy all this rum burring don't your girl's parents subject to these late hours every night well I'm sure they don't how can you be so sure her old man gives me the money to take her out why sure he's not like our principal mr. Brill is a real good sport stretch you mean to tell me you've been taking out Judy Brill how do you know a little bird brain told me I can't wait to see mr. Conklin's reaction to this bit of news hush Miss Brooks you're not gonna tell mr. Cochran are you not yet stretch out of consideration for his family there's something I've got to find out first what's up if his life insurance is paid up I've talked through your entire lunch mr. Vaughn but it couldn't be helped if we're going to get any favors from mr. Conklin we've got the straightened out stretch Snodgrass I'm glad you told me the story miss Brooks imagine Jason grill putting his own daughter up to a trick like that what kind of a girl is this Judy brill anyhow well you know the expression sweet 16 and never been kissed yes when this kid reached 12 she was ineligible I met her last summer mr. Boren Judy brill is quite a little firebrand she's as an age now where she considers all males fair game there's an age this boys been learning biology as well as teaching it look mr. Barton when I found out that stretch was going with Jason drills daughter I devised the plan we're going to beat Jason brill at his own game all we have to do is to get stretched to think that Judy's just a flirt and he'll lose all interest in her brother how do we do that by letting stretch catch her on a date with some other boy what other boy Walter Denton Walter didn't mention my name oh you're just in time Walter sit down please mr. Boynton and I would like to talk to you okay have you thought of any way to get stretches mind off the mystery woman and back on his football game miss Brooks yes Walter I thought of a dilly of a plan but it requires some cooperation from you oh we should all do whatever we can Walter this is a crisis well yeah but what can I do he won't even tell me the name of this chick the name of the chick is Judy brill and her father's been paying all the expenses to keep stretch out late every night rumbling rumbling yes rumbling while the Clay City team is getting its rest Judy Brill is keeping our star players backfield in motion but I know the kind of a boy stretch is and if we can arrange to have him catch Judy with another boyfriend I know he'll forget all about her not only forget about her but it might make him so mad he'll go out on that field Saturday and play the game of his life say that sounds like a swell idea you know of course stretches boxing champ of Madison too so it might not be so pleasant for the guy he catches with his girl all right that's a necessary risk I guess who's the chump you've got lined up to be the Patsy in it don't be crude Patsy Oh Walter I thought that you'd be happy to volunteer for the job me you want to see Madison beat play City don't you well sure I do but well I have my bandages off in time oh you've never seen stretch fight I have believe me Walter mr. Boynton and I will make sure that stretch doesn't lay a hand on you he doesn't have to he could kick me to death I'm afraid you just have to count me out folks no don't you out over the water stretch is a very dear friend of yours oh you don't want to see him ruin his life do you don't you see Walter this girl isn't right for stretch it isn't just a football game that's involved it's a boy's future but what about my future what about your future I want to be around when a gets here Oh stretch has a terrible temper and if he catches me making goo-goo eyes at his girl he'll clobber me till I'm dismal besides there's Harriet Conklin you know where virtually betrothed now what would she think if she heard I was out with another girl she won't hear Walter and even if she does we can always explain that you were just doing it for the good of your school no I'm sorry no I'd rather not take the chance I'm surprised at you Walter haven't you any sense of loyalty haven't you any school spirit this whole thing won't take you more than half an hour all you have to do is sit on the couch and put your arms around a little redheaded girl with big blue eyes a cute little turned-up nose and an adorable mouth now I still think that if stretch and an adorable mouth exquisite nobody can say I haven't got any school spirit what time and where make it 8 o'clock tonight at my place I'll drop over to Clay City High this afternoon and tell Judy I'm thinking of accepting her father's invitation to join the faculty there next term then I'll invite her over to my place for dinner ostensibly so I can ask some questions about my new pupil but supposing she won't come Oh she'll be glad to come judy brill's just a little girl to be asked to dinner by a woman like Miss Brooks is quite flattering after all when you get right down to ages when you get right down to ages I'm almost twice as tall as Judy brill therefore day of my plan worked perfectly and that afternoon I persuaded Judy Brill to have dinner at my house so at 8 o'clock that evening we were in the living-room gabbing away like a couple of old extremely young Magpies I'm sure glad you asked me over tonight Miss Brooks the dinner was wonderful and I've enjoyed talking to you about your teaching at Clay City next turn I suppose you feel you should be out dancing stretches feed off but you've still got three nights before the big game and not seeing you tonight will only make him more anxious you are so right men are such problems they're just like children you've got to play up to their ego and convince each one he's the only man in your life oh but listen to me telling you about men misstated charming woman like you tell the truth how many men do you have Dan Ling from a string just one Judy and he doesn't exactly dangle he sort of Bob's and weaves as if I believe that about a woman like you miss Brooke oh I wish I had your knowledge of mam one trade it was a very pleasant coincidence that Walter death dropped over don't you see he's an awfully cute boy I'm glad you like him Judy by the way where did he disappear to I didn't disappear she's on my lap nice that's three what a naive way to get acquainted I better answer that mrs. Davis is in her sitting room down the hall want me to answer you sit right where you are Walton yes you sit right where you are Walter how can I help but she hasn't budged off me since I said how do you do mr. oh I'll get it well here we are miss Brooks hello mr. barn huh come on in stretch Thanks well what brings you to this part of town stretch I was just walking home with mr. Boynton grow up along side the curb in his car and stuck his head out of the window and said hi stretched just the fall I've been looking for how about hopping in it going for a little ride over to Miss Brooks place and having a glass of milk or something if you haven't got anything better to do I don't have nothin better to do so I said okay mister boy I like nothing better than the Hopkin and go to mister have you got any that's what brings you to this part of town well I'll give you some milk later stretch there are some friends of yours in the living room come on in oh pardon me kids but we've got company hi Walter I didn't know the Judy what are you doing here miss Brooke's invited me over to dinner and then Walter just so did drop by sort of drop by holding Miss Brooks mr. Boynton wait everybody so jumpy about what right you sore at me for sitting here with your girl sue heck no Walter you're doing me a big favor see I got to thinking about what miss Brooks said this morning I realized I get a lot more sleep if I'm gonna be any good in the game Saturday but stretched here you don't have to sleep so much sure I do all right I don't appreciate what you and your dad done for me Judy and I certainly ain't mad about all that rumbling it's just that for athletes rum brands not as good as slumbering now Walter if I may make a suggestion I think you should drop miss Brill off at the bus station what's this all about anyway is this some kind of a prod turnabout's fair play miss brill yeah well if you'll excuse me right now I'll turn about and hit the road I'll excuse all of you right now all but you mr. binding well this is what I get for accepting the hospitality of a Madison High ight thank you and good night and don't slam the door now come on stretch the least we can do is drop her off at the bus station good night miss brockless pointin right now well it's simmered down to just the two of us mr. Bern whoo let's sit down on the couch all right you know Miss Brooks in spite of the fact that I'm a biologist I've never been overly observant about the emotional reactions of the people around me you're not just beating your Bunsen burner Boynton that is you have seemed a little preoccupied at time be that as it may your interest in the welfare of my little animals the trouble you went to to see that I got proper heating facilities from my lab it made me realize just how much you care really mr. Biden yes indeed and I want you to know that I care even more than you do you care even more than I do yes I've got $5.00 bet on that game Saturday well here's 250 I'll take half your bet and we'll set up housekeeping on the 40-yard line and now a word from our star e barking well we all had a wonderful time at the football game honest book starring Lee wasn't I'm fraud and abuse directed by Rory now Louis for the music above Weston mr. Conklin was played by Gale Gordon others in tonight's cast were Jane Morgan dick Crenna Bob Rockwell gloria mcmillan Leonard Smith and Sandra Gould you you you now it's our miss Brooke starring Eve Arden well most rivalries between schoolteachers are restricted to working hours but the one between our Miss Brooks of Madison High School and Daisy Enright extends into their personal lives in fact to see these two English teachers engaged in one of their frequent verbal Tiff's a casual observer might think that either one would cheerfully cut the other's throat for a nickel but this isn't so no indeed I'd give four cents change after what happened this past week I might not even take the penny it all started last Friday morning I was in my room packing a suitcase for a little weekend trip and my landlady was helping me mrs. Davis mr. Boynton is going to Eagle Springs for the weekend so I thought it was only logical for me to go to the same place does he know you're going nobody knows why not security reasons I want to spend these few days with mr. Boynton alone and if Daisy Enright finds out our destination that little dream is done for you mean she'd go up the ego Springs - on her jet room she's giving me some real competition lately she has a certain way with men that just seems to make them do whatever she wants them to why even mr. Conklin's partial to her that's nothing new I've known for a long time that she's the principal's pet well I wish he'd keep her on the leash there's a chance to make a bit of extra money around school she's the first one to get a crack at it he even put her in charge of the new switchboard we had installed last week but doesn't that require an experienced telephone operator they're pretty difficult to get right now so she's filling in temporarily she takes the board herself during her free period and appoints various other teachers to take over the rest of the time what burns me up is the way she got the job by telling mr. Conklin she worked for the phone company when she was a girl what a fish story that is oh there's Walter Denton to drive me to school be right there Walter before you go Connie tell me why do you think it's a fish story because when she was a girl the telephone hadn't been invented Walter please there's no law that says we can't use all four tires going around the corner now slow down little a Thousand pardons dear teacher and frankly I'm barely conscious of the speed with which we are traversing this mundane sphere is only the corporeal Walter Denton who is restricted to the confines of this vehicle the spiritual me is floating in the heavenly blue on silver wings no bailout cherub I'm not ready for harp lessons the reason for this pedestrian destroying ecstasy its hurry up Conklin miss Brooke's she's been treating me like an angel lately last night when her folks rot visiting she even cooked dinner for me gosh it was romantic what did you have liver and onions holy the food of love be honest I was so grateful I barely felt the heartburn but always his beer and skittles as much as Harriet adores me that's how much her father hates the sight of me oh don't tell me you're having trouble with mr. Conklin again no no no more than usual now I wrote an editorial in the monitor a couple of days ago that mr. Conklin didn't agree with you see in it I said I was opposed to hiring a permanent substitute for one of our German teachers which one wolfgang Himmel Stas he's the nice old fellow who's been sick for the past week oh I wouldn't know booth gang isn't one of my intimates at school well the other teachers have been sharing his duties so far but I heard that mr. Conklin is looking for a younger teacher to take over his class that means when mr. him--all stas gets better he won't have a job well it's nice of you to be so loyal to an old teacher Walter I feel the same way about you miss Brooks and I'd go to bat for you too that's why you've got to go to bat for mr. him--all stas me certainly nah how would you like it if you were a worn-out old lonely broken-down bachelor I'm getting used to it how can I help mr. him--all stas well by mentioning to mr. Conklin that you don't think he should replace him will you miss Brooke's will you do that for me and for all the kids who've grown so fond of mr. him whilst I sir will you miss Brooke's huh will you huh well boy that's a relief promise my minds at ease that's one thing about you boy once you make a promise a guy doesn't have to worry about a thing he can rest assured that you'll keep your word or die in the attempt yes sir good morning Harriet oh good morning miss Brooks I have a message for you I know your father wants to see me in his office immediately no miss enlight wants to see you in the faculty room this one on your left well if it isn't the mumps it's the measles well I might as well find out what's on her frightening little mind I'll see you in class Harriet bye-bye miss Brooks toodles and miss n Ride Oh come in darling my you're looking lovely this morning I'm mad about that dress you're wearing it does so much to bring out your natural lines really yes especially the ones around your eyes well then there's no time for chitchat miss Brooke's we've got to sit down and have a real heart-to-heart talk alright borrow a heart and let's get started I'll ignore that remark because there's too much at stake to bicker now we're both aware of the fact that we're interested in the same man and each one of us has been keeping extremely close tabs on him for instance I heard that he's going to spend the weekend at Eagle Spring Eagle Springs from now who could have started such a ridiculous rumor mr. Boynton told me himself he's the logical one to start it off I also have a hunch that we were both going to surprise him by showing up at the same place why miss in right wherever did you get such a fantastic notion I've got my train ticket in the bag in my locker where are yours I'm picking them up after school I suppose we did have the same idea you see Miss Brooke with such an elusive query we've got to be more cagey I'm sure that mr. Barton sees some good points in both of us but the way we've been going about things we're only hurting each other's chances miss Enright you may have something there what do you suggest that one of us step out of the picture completely for a specified amount of time and leave the other a clear field how much time for instance well how about a couple of months fine see you in January miss Enright not so fast we'll decide who's going to remove herself first in a sportsman like manner say by dealing a hand of cards her hand of cards you know some of us play bridge during lunch hour and I just happened to have a dick in my handbag you have the nerve to go through with it no sit down and deal miss Enright what kind of a game shall we play well do you know poker I've heard of it fine then I'll be a one hand of Draw Poker and the loser agrees to stay away from mr. Boynton for a period of two months commencing at once right right all right here we are now you care to cup the day run them one two three four five there know how many cards do you want miss Brooke's let's see I'll take four how about you I'll play these you got miss Brooke's a pair of ten oh no good I've got four aces well that's that oh I'm glad you're taking it like a good sport miss Brooke's may I walk to your class with you sure if you don't mind climbing for flight bull I'd but your classrooms on the first floor I know but whoever heard of jumping from a first-floor window I determined to live up to my bargain with miss Enright and sever all relations with the bashful biologist as I approached our usual table in the cafeteria at lunchtime I resolved to get it over with as quickly and painlessly as possible mr. Boynton yes goodbye goodbye you're going somewhere miss Brooks yes out of your life goodbye just a moment what on earth you're talking about it's just that I got to thinking about our relationship mr. Barton and I've come to the conclusion that it's best for both of us if we don't see each other for a while but why miss Brooks how did you come to that conclusion I know I did something when it's nothing you've done it's not going to be easy of course we've had some memorable times together those exciting nights when we stroll through the zoo those long walks past the aquarium those evenings under the stars just you and me in the planetarium now that I've made my decision all that seems aces ago ages ago miss Brooks I think we should talk this over I haven't picked up my train ticket to Eagle Springs yet I was going to phone in my reservation after school but I don't have to go up there this weekend oh yes you do mr. Barton if I'm gonna be a good sport you've got to go this is goodbye please don't make it any harder hmm that's the way you really feel about it I don't suppose that's the way I feel just give me one long lingering kiss and I'll go okay what's your next best offer I just thought that since we've always been such good friends we should part as good friends do hmm well I guess I could kiss you good-bye if you want to I want I want well I'm all puckered mr. Barney Oh eyes closed and puckered cooling soup miss Brooke indeed if you'll excuse me sir I've got to get some sherbet I said I'd pick it up before it got cold he's a little nervous today miss Brooks what was the meaning of that hideous oscul Ettore display I was about to witness I was just saying goodbye to mr. Boynton sir he's going away and I goodbye you looked like a sea lion about to play Yankee Doodle on a Calliope the idea of kissing in the public school cafeteria is that what the Board of Education pays you for Miss Brooks if it is they haven't been getting their money's worth though the insolence to think that in one English department I should have two such extremes and teachers as Miss Enright and you the one alert calm efficient the other an emotional mooning lovesick cocker spaniel I don't know maybe it's just the way her ears flopped down that make this end right look my men Miss Brooke sometimes I don't know what I'd do without miss Enright in addition to her duties as an English teacher she has recently taken over the operation of our new switchboard yes I know sir she's very clever Plus which just a few moments ago she solved another problem for me she has suggested a teacher to take mr. him--all sausage play but mr. Helme of stas is perfectly capable of taking his own place I mean when he gets better he'll be completely well that is everybody's so attached to him mr. Conklin and he's quite old that just if this Smithson Felder is young well I don't care how you miss Mertzon Felder I'm only on this afternoon to make an appointment as Enright speaks very highly other ah stand aside please you're sentimental pleading cannot stay me from my rendezvous with some meatball and watch that fraternization miss glad I yes glad I I'll bet that miss Schmitz entailed her walks with a goose step just not fair then you mind if I join you Miss Brooks I've been talking to myself too lately sit down Walter what's your trouble your old model it and mr. Conklin's had me on cleanup detail during my free period yeah it's usually pretty dull work but I just found something quite interesting in a trash basket in the Faculty room what is it well this deck of cards see well those are the cards miss Enright and I used this morning what but you played her with these but this is a trick deck miss Brooke she could clobber you with these she did clobber me you mean by trick day it's stacked did she beat you for much Miss Brooks just about two months of my life but Walter I think I've got an idea excuse me please where are you going miss Brooks I'm going to see a floppy-eared spaniel about a man where you are being a good sport miss Brooke's this being my free period I was about to take over the switchboard myself Oh think nothing of it miss Enright I'll be happy to take over for you I know how rushed you must be particularly if you want to make that 4:30 train oh yes it's the only one up to Eagle Springs today but you're sure you know how to handle switchboard miss groves miss Enright I worked on the board of a summer resort for an entire summer when I was in my teens and you learned everything on a Resort switchboard that was the summer I grew up well I guess there's no sense in looking a gift horse in the mouth now figuratively speaking of course oh that's all right slip me the earphones and call me native dancer well very well I'm off to the country remember now I have quite a reputation for efficiency with mr. Compton don't you worry about that miss Enright I'll take care of your duties and your reputation but good this switchboard is a pretty complicated gadget thank goodness there haven't been any cops oh it goes one of the lights now oh it's pretty I guess I plugged this cord in under it Madison High School would you connect me with her apparently she's in the home economics class I'd love to alter my sports what are you doing there is Miss Anne Wright at the switchboard not unless she sneaked in under me now you wanted the home economics class I wonder which hole I plug in for that don't you know well they all look alike to me oh there's another call hold it Walter I'll have to get back to you a Madison High School hello would you connect me with Miss Brooks please oh hello mrs.

Conklin Oh what about your last position oh I wasn't canned on account of mine teaching the silliest reason nor the silliest reason how was I don't know he didn't like crap games in the elevator right spoke of you so highly yeah it's too bad she couldn't say the same about you what a temper she said you got she said dooba straight nuts to you miss Enright said that either is the word of truth in it I'm essentially a very mild-mannered man anyone who knows make a dog for that of course they could ask someone else oh I'm sorry mr.

Conklin I've got one more line that's still free and I know just what I'm going to do with it what hang myself what else and now here's the star of our show Eve Arden well we finally got our lines untangled though I'm still not sure how honest crook sorry vodka transcribed is produced and directed by Larry burns written by Arthur all's Bergen al Lewis with the music of luck plus key mr. content was played by Gale Gordon others in tonight's cast were Jane Morgan Dick Crenna Bob Rockwell gloria mcmillan and Mary Jane crow Oh ah ah next week at the same time louver this same station Eve Arden in the role of Madison High School's favorite English teacher Miss Brooks will again call the student body together don't you be absent our miss foots is presented each week to the worldwide facilities of the United States Armed Forces radio and television service Oh now it's our Miss Brooks story Eve Arden well over the years our Miss Brooks who teaches English at Madison High has had more than her share of difficulties with her principal mr. Conklin recently however their relations have improved yes my uncle and man feel a lot better actually the some things have been a bit smoother between mr. Conklin than me in fact when I suggested the plan I had heard about to supplement our teaching with movies mr. Conklin gave me the money to try it out so until last week when the great experiment was to take place in one of my classes everything was going splendidly and in more ways than one because Thursday morning mr. Boynton was over at my house for breakfast my landlady was attending an early Club meeting so there were just the two of us I could sense that mr. Boynton felt the warm romantic implications of this domestic scene because his voice seemed choked with emotion when he said I wonder how long joel palooka will be chimp idea why don't you ask little Abner little Abner he's been staring at me from the other side of that newspaper for the past 10 minutes whoa oh pardon me miss Brooks reading the paper was rather rude I guess it's just that I feel so at home here I didn't think you'd mind oh I really don't mr. Boynton that's just the way I want you to feel good I haven't had this sort of breakfast since I was home with mother well have you ever thought that you might enjoy a breakfast like this every day mr. barnman course I have Miss Brooks many times but Dad needs are too much for mom to come down here quite what I had in mind how's your latest project at school working out miss Brooke's I don't know yet mr. Barton the first film the Lady of the lake was shown to my English class yesterday good you don't know how it worked out no I had to do something for mr. Conklin during that hour so I let the kids run the picture themselves will know how it was received when Walter Denton takes us up in a few minutes films can be a big help to all teachers while other schools have been showing movies in their classrooms for years wonder why mr. Conklin would never allow it at Madison before he hates popcorn day is very fond of the idea though in fact she's showing a film at her clubs breakfast this morning she rented it from the same place I did what pictured she ran a little number called shearing sheep at big Billabong Australia what's it about it's about cheering sheep that's big Billabong the ladies and mrs. Davis is club shearing sheep in Australia why should that be perfect for the ladies and mrs. Davis club there are some pretty woolly ladies and mrs. Davis is five oh that must be Walter come on in the door is open I'm anxious to hear how your audio-visual experiment was received for the English class if past performances mean anything I know exactly what happened five minutes after I left the room what they left the room pleasant surprise greetings to my two favorite faculty members the fairest of the fair and the brawn iasts of the brawny I always just adding in these shoulders it makes me look hey where's the upper vest mr. Davis this morning she's fizzing at a ladies club breakfast wow that must be the same one mom and mrs. Conklin are attending Walter we're both anxious to hear how that audio-visual experiment worked out yesterday yes how would the Lady of the lake received Walter oh great Miss Brooks he unfortunately the sound part of the projector didn't work but this class made up for that well you never heard such whistling in your life whistling at the lady of the lake what did she do come out exactly Miss Brooks you see the title on the can the picture came in said the lady of the lake alright but the picture turned out to be something called sirens of the screen past and present and we put it on at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and every fella in the class was late for dinner last night it's only a 15 minute short I know but we ran a 23 times you don't mean that yeah and we stopped to protect her for 10 minutes every time we got the Marilyn Monroe hell afternoon plan for next week miss Brooks a little epic called the teacher dies at dawn I'm worried about this yet Walter oh I don't know Miss Brooks I hope he hasn't I know what this project means to you Miss Brooks well cheer up mr. boy even if he has heard about it we can still get a picture of the Lady of the lake what do you mean I may drown myself now if you'll be seated miss Brooke's I'll come directly to the pie yes sir as an experiment in audio-visual education I gave you not only permission but also 15 dollars to rent a projector and film of the poem the Lady of the lake something go wrong mr. miss Bruce when I did so I had no idea that the Lady of the lake would turn out to be Marilyn Monroe Esther Williams would have been much more appropriate I can explain this MacLaine explain this thing when you wanted this film you told me it was Sir Walter Scott's poem presented against the background of Scottish seas as it there the only Scotch in that entire picture was in a glass in Peterborough's hair and you've run the picture mr. Conklin five times I that is I ran it through a few times to convince myself that what I was seeing was true sirens of The Scream indeed I've already heard from mr. stone this morning and he was furious it seems that five parents have already complained to him about it he blames the whole thing on me but why you sir it was my idea I know but I took credit for it this is a mistake on the part of the company institutional pictures it probably won't happen again in another ten years we're all entitled to one mistake aren't we sometimes when I think of you miss Brooke's that is the only thing that keeps me going but I told mr. stone it was all a mistake and I also told him we had another film in case he wanted to reassure himself on the subject matter of the pictures we are showing but sir we haven't another picture and including the projector they cost $15 to rent that is your problem miss Brooks you got us into this thing and you are going to get us out of it in any event mr. stone said he wouldn't bother to come over unless for a further complaint however if there are he said heads would roll Osric onsen principal speaking who is she's right here now for you miss probe for me sir hello hello Connie mrs. Davis oh hello mrs. Davis I just called it can you off the picture I showed you the ladies top breakfast turns out I ain't both credit for the idea to you of course and I told the ladies that this was the identical sort of picture being a donut Madison hi I see well how did cheering sheep at big Billabong turn out all those scenes in the night chopper terrific beer and the ones of the showgirls dressing room or even more sensation well where were the sheets you know that's what we three times trying to find them it was all about a chorus girl however none of the ladies into mind that is none except mrs. stone mrs. stone was there what did she say mrs. Davis oh you can say a pain dear he just fainted oh no not at all mrs. Davis my tongue always sticks to the roof of my mouth in the morning I'll speak to you later - bye - what was that all about miss Brooke mr. Conklin did mr. stone really say heads would roll if there was another complaint that's exactly what he's hit miss Brooks what about it nothing sir only I wonder how we'll both look when we're ten inches shorter I told mr. Boynton about my predicament in the school cafeteria at lunch time let's see if I've got it straight miss Brooks you must have another film here to show mr. stone when he arrives it's after noon or the entire project goes right out the window followed swiftly by me and the cost of renting a new film and projector is $15 which I've got to get somewhere where's mr. Conklin giving you anything yes two hours in which to dig it up well you can count on me for part of the $15 oh really mr. boy what part two dollars and thirty five cents here's a 35 cent now well thanks mr. Varney but where's the $2 oh just a second till I take off my shoe tell me you've got two dollars in your shoe well no I've only got one dollar in my shoe where's the other dollar in my hatband let me make a nervous wreck out of a holdup man I do appreciate your mr. boy oh hello Harry I hope I'm not interrupting anything but mr. Boynton what's doing with your shoe wha he's just airing out his money well first daddy asked me to tell you to be sure to be in his office with the new film by 3:30 because that's what mr. stones do to arrive and secondly knowing the position you're in I went around to all the girls and took up a collection for you I'm beginning to feel like a charity case remember the old proverb Miss Brooks pride goeth before a fall dad I know it and at this point I'm not going to turn down anything I knew you needed $15 so I canvassed about 30 girls miss Brooks I told them to cough up as much as they could how much did you collect 80 cents not much of a car I've also got a dollar of my own I want to lend you oh no really Harriet I wouldn't dream at all but mister all right dear Hugh and said where is the dollar I'll give it to you as soon as I go down to my locker after lunch the dollars in your locker boy not exactly Miss Brooks but but that's the only place I can remove the stocking I'm wearing over it the wallet industry depended on this school if you go broke thanks a lot Harry here's the money miss first I get the very best I could I knew all the precincts hadn't been heard from would you check up a collection to Walter oh yes sir I went around to all the fellows in your English Lit class miss Brooks and I told them you needed 15 iron men for a new film and since they'd all seen sirens of the screen this was one little way of expressing their gratitude oh oh and how much did you collect 65 cents done a bigger business with Lady of the lake oh that's not all I want to lynch a dollar of my own which I've kept for just such an emergency thanks Walter where is it well you know that good-luck charm I wear around my neck with my mother's picture in it yes well that's not my mother it's George Washington more to people than meets the eye now let's see mr. Boynton has to dot 35 cents for me carry at 180 and Walter a dollar 65 that comes to approximately $6 then I've got another couple of dollars of my own well I didn't think you had any money miss Brooks what is you've got two dollars remember when I went to the dentist last week yes well I stashed two dollars away in the temporary filling all I'm I'm dreadfully sorry miss Brooks but institutional pictures can't accept $8 on a projector in film which rents for 15 but mr. Gibson it was your mistake in the first place you sent a sirens of the screen cast and present when I'd ordered the Lady of the lake from your salesman I think his name was Blake oh yes we've had nothing but trouble with that man our manager wouldn't raise his salary so out of sheer spite he switched any number of films on us before he quit I'd like to help you but we have a strict 24 hour ruling and you've had your film for several days you'll just have to tell your organization that if what what is it by the way a ladies club social service group Union I teach at Madison high school you do what why our biggest rental is to schools you showed sirens of the screen to a high school class with a 10-minute stop over at Marilyn Monroe looks like a very fair-minded person I'll tell you what I'll do you keep the $8 knowledge you have the new film and projector for nothing well I'll make it four films for nothing man forget about the rentals entirely I'll give you a year's supply a film's free if you get your school to forget this incident land I'll throw in ten dollars for yourself well miss Brooke's aren't good I after me I'm doing good enough of the whale just give me a good film to show the head of our school board when he comes to Madison this afternoon and we'll call it square oh you're the salt of the earth I have just the thing for the occasion a Board of Education at work don't you think it's perfect I suppose those you like fantasy well when mr. Gibson agreed to rectify his mistake and give me a new film to show mr. stone it seemed that my troubles were just about over at 3:00 that afternoon we were getting everything ready and mr. confidence office well the projectors all set up Miss Brooks all we have to do when mr. Conklin mr. stone get here is turn the switch and run the film yeah this off it's got to be a perfect projection room it seat the way I've fixed the shades no light can get in through the windows at all oh you've done a beautiful job while there there's only one thing that bothers me the sound on this projector doesn't work but mr. Conklin in the room nobody will notice the difference we still got a few minutes before daddy gets here where we run the film through once to the four of us good idea Harriet let's sit down yeah but there are only two chairs in this room where are the four of us going to set we can worry about that when the lights are out are you talking about what Waller means is that he and Harriet can share the big comfortable chair that mr. Conklin keeps for visitors what about the two of us we can divide this narrow one and don't look so panicky we can either show the film or just turn out the lights and wait until mr. Conklin mrs. stone get here just turn out the light what good let's do does that answer your question maybe we better run the film I was afraid you'd see it that right all right Walter turn off the desk light let's get started yes ma'am there we are yes I can't see a thing where are you Miss Brooks are you seated yet after you mr. Biman and it I'll sit on the edge of the chair nearest the projector switch now are we all set Walter Robert oh what a magnificent view of the Rock of Gibraltar I feel as if I could reach out and touch it you're staring at my chin miss Brooke's you're a leaning rather close to me how nice of you to know this well we've missed the title but we know it's about the Board of Education that worked well look at that sign by the side of the road it says you are now entering Las Vegas Nevada it's probably all about the Las Vegas Board of Education I hope you're right of course I am there they are now all working around the table nice table the Boyne this is a picture about gambling there's been another terrible mistake turn off the projector at once Miss Brooks well I'm trying to just the switch is stuck pull the plug out of the wall I don't know where the wall plug is with the lights off Walter turn on the desk lamp so mr. Boynton can find the plug Walter Walter do you hear me find it in the dark mr. Boynton I'll try oh good you found it going on in here mr. Conklin Oh a just a moment sir I'll turn on the light no no never mind the lights miss Brooks since you've apparently started your new film the Board of Education at work I'd like to have a look at it before mr. stone gets here here sit in my chair sir oh where will you sit I'll stand in front of a screen it isn't a very good picture mr. Cockrell stop stop badly please I'll just settle myself in this comfortable chair on the other side of the projector area please here's me you just thought on my knees daddy and you're a little heavy Harriet's what are you talking about I doubt if I can hold the both of you since where are you he's between the devil and the deep blue sea well turn on those wall lights Boynton yes sir uh-huh Harriet I want you in Denton to leave this room at once through my in office please and I'll speak to you both later very well daddy mr.

nothing to worry about and if you as her husband wish you ain't and she proves it where she can the worst she can do is throw you in jail which she came how do you mean Bertie I'll try to remember that well it's just too bad she had to come here I don't use that name the newspapers with the story well the police I hope it's what I think it is uh you suppose it could be that woman you bring it in Bertie this was straight not everything kiddies well your old aunt was pretty shrewd those telegrams from an old pal of mine Burt Bradbury who proved I wasn't in Duluth in 1938 I was in Oshkosh Oh bird Bradbury and tock Horton T Gillis leave the unknown at this address what happened to Burt mr. gills leave if you don't stop taste nothing down the rooms you go where a hole in that carpet dirty I don't know what to do I keep running into blind alleys that woman was after me I did but open road I can't leave town Bertie that would be an admission yes and let's leave you in no position to admit nothing you know I even called oshkosh long distance no wonder they didn't know Bert Bradbury and me they tore down the boardinghouse for a pickle factory Bertie you better get the phone yeah it could be that woman nice she's down at the corner she's coming right over here oh my goodness and she sounds like she's loaded for bear who else he can't intimidate me no I'm innocent Bertie I'm not Julia being married no sir the other thing to do is to have it out with it I was down on my own two feet and battledore toe to toe if you don't mind me putting in my two cents worth yes really sometimes when you cross an angry woman she just gives angry I know cause that woman yeah I suppose you're right what you need is time to clear things up and you got to keep a pacified why are you doing it Bertie how do you pacify a buzz saw I don't want that woman here okay take her out treated to dinner Keith ain't going smooth until you get you evidence if you got any well that makes sense yeah yeah you bet I'll be nice to above all I want to get her out of the house before my dream Leroy come so doorbell this time you get it it's out I killed asleep mrs. cosgrove sorry I wasn't available when you call before you skip town again close the door you know oh yes fidelity where are the children you talked about you well they're not here mm-hmm thought you know the thief didn't die no mrs. cosgrove stop calling me mrs. cosgrove you know my first name y-yes Susie Farrell yeah well yes sir sit down sir over there couch couch you don't mind other than the piano stool ooh-whee Oliver stop being so standoffish it seems to me that after 14 years well there's plenty of time I hope you make a lot of money we may not go back to Duluth wouldn't you like to show me the upstairs no mrs. cosgrove Sarah you don't take off your hat why shouldn't I make myself at home yeah I thought we might go to dinner you talk things over see the town go dancing sounds like my old way over I guess if I'm going to live here I should see the town Oh about the Wilbur let's remember I'm Throckmorton P Gillis lead Wilbur let's not go through that again well look at it this way whatever my name is I'm known here is Throckmorton P Gillis Lee so please call me that all right I'll call you rock but what if you try to skip out on me again I warn you I have your elephant gun in my hotel room not a gun yeah but you use it too come along little likey you serve out a whole mix guilties breakfast miss Marjorie I don't know birdie you didn't get in until late last night I wasn't so sure and go make it at all after she mentioned that elephant gun good morning what a beautiful morning Oh everything must've worked out fine hunky yeah what happened well I decided the way to get along with mrs. cosgrove was to be nice to it oh then birdies idea work Rudy's I did you well she did think of it but it took the old master to really make it work oh and I don't mind admitting that I was at my charming base oh you see after birdies idea started to work I added one of my own suits that Wilbur was always running out on mrs. cosgrove I'm not paying any attention to it I decided to be just the opposite I showered her with attention deadly with witty sayings yes indeed you don't think your old uncle can turn on the personality my boy last night I was a regular Don Juan I even sang and read well I did that because I found out this fellow Wilbur couldn't carry a tune you didn't even know how to dance how do you feel about things now in my eyes you by now she must realize that I'm not her you can be done in different ways I know Wilbur may be a wisdom the field of adventure is that I'm talking about charming the ladies when it comes to that I'm a real charm ball well good for you auntie I think was a very clever scheme my only concern is that you may prefer a man like me to Wilbur well is she's leaving town and wants to thank me for the big evening yeah yeah it wasn't a lazy eye returning to Duluth this morning see what did I tell you see what else she said absolute last night I'm convinced that you're not my Wilbur I nothing important oh I give me that note my husband could never be such

through college delivering milk I'm going to the 11 o'clock service the way I always do I'll need my sleep so I'll be alert when I pass the collection plate I don't want to drop it again of course I can drive Leroy and Bertie to the service but I wish you'd come along he's birdee going she's singing in the choir 100 voices on well I would like to hear birdie sing well is there 99 other voices I wouldn't hear much of birdie anyway no no it isn't that very well I intend going to the 11 o'clock service tomorrow every day all planned a very busy day we all have a busy day ahead on heat yeah I

Hill will be banked with flowers yes I read about that well I've been there every year that's worth it just to hear those trumpets when the Sun comes up it is very hot Easter such a thrilling day and monkey you'll see all the beautiful women in their new spring dresses eh well if you children insist glad you change your mind is kill food yeah well I didn't exactly change my mind I've been considering going for some time but I wanted to be sure all of you are willing to get up at 4 o'clock as I am Hey look at Phoebe's window all decorated for Easter the that rabbit holding the talcum powder looks just like Judge hooker you think I'll go in I still don't have a gift for Paula OPP can I do for you this morning Phoebe what would make a nice Easter gift for Paula winter when Easter usually a little chilly how about a hot water bottle hmm how about some perfume perfume women like to dress up for Easter and a good perfume like this is the crowning touch how much is it Phoebe twelve down is an ounce that's their crowning tags wrap it up you're teaching a man planning a big day I am yes indeed Peevy guess what important official is getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning for the sunrise service Reverend McNair well he's got to be there I'm thinking about a fella who's just volunteering hey yep I'm taking a little panel and then I'm passing the collection plate at the 11 o'clock service too good for you I went to both services one Easter that's so I didn't sleep tonight before not wanting to miss the sunrise service and by an eleven o'clock my eyes were so red I wore dark glasses to church you did you know what the minister did he lectured me for staying out all night oh my good but mrs. Peevy and I always enjoyed the sunrise services of course it's usually a little foggy at that hour but well I haven't been up at that hour since I was an air raid warden well you'd better take a flashlight there's a tendency to bump into trees oh and if you're showing off a new salute you I don't take a cushion along TV I'm not the sort of person who just goes somewhere to show off I'm wearing my old blue serge yes yes it's quite a climb up Cedar Hill mr. Gildersleeve you trying to discourage me boom I know I I consider it quite a rewarding experience in fact mrs. Peevy and I would be going again this year if she could stand the track again settling for the 11 o'clock service I you Peedee yeah but between you and me and the gatepost I'd rather get up at 4 o'clock and go with you then go to the 11 o'clock with me 2pv well I don't follow you when she insists on wearing your new Easter bonnet what's the matter with defeating that bad dude words it's one of those dove on the nest affairs Oh mr. Gildersleeve I don't mind having people pointed mr. Peavey's hat but when bird dogs start fighting it can't be that bad you know I wouldn't well Gildersleeve you're ready for the sunrise service I wonder if I will need this flashlight Phoebus / oh the judge I am Diogenes judge what do you mean Diogenes that flashlight you must be looking for an honest man Here I am you're right judge hop in I'll take you home you thanks iris that's where I'm headed Gilda why are you carrying a flashlight in the middle of the day no I need it in the morning I'm getting up at 4 o'clock you're going to the Sun right serve it and I'm going to 11 o'clock service yeah you must have a new suit you want to display judge you're as bad as Pete I'm not going to church just to show off my clothes besides I don't have an issue to show up I see here's a bump yelled a what bumped me in the back of the head that's my canteen canteen what is all this junk in the back of your car there miss battles blankets folding chairs and the buffalo roam judge where are you going on a safari I'm taking miss Matterhorn to the sunrise service do you need all this equipment well yeah prepare for it you're not just taking a flashlight are you well I decide what I have in the car miss Matterhorn is packing a lunch basket lunch but the road to Cedar Hill is narrow building and with several hundred cars up there it takes hours to get home miss Matterhorn and I enjoy the service then spread our lunch and listen to the scene birds and the clash of bumpers mm-hmm that 11 o'clock service looks better and better but algae I thought it was all settled that you'd go no mind you they can conduct the sunrise service without me you Leroy and Bertie go and enjoy yourselves I don't know why you don't go my idea I might not get back in time to pass the plate at the regular service judge says traffic is pretty heavy out there um you just cooled off on the idea yeah I'll admit I'm not as keen of others I was this morning why well PB in the judge metal to me they accuse me are going just to show off my new Easter suit but you don't have a new Easter suit you just don't want to miss out on your sleep that's all that has nothing to do with it I'm staying home as a matter of principle all right on key if that's your final decision that's my final decision Paula Marjorie hello mrs. Winthrop voila I was about to come over and pay you a visit oh really I have a little Easter gift for you well had very thoughtful of you well why don't you give it to me early tomorrow morning early tomorrow morning uh-huh Leroy told me you're all going to sunrise service you did well would it be terrible of me if I invited myself to go along Oh Leroy Bertie and I will be delighted to have you go with it well I had no idea you plan to go to the service oh I would miss it Marjorie you should see my Easter suit oh I want to it's blue pastel file with pique collar cuffs and gloves to match oh it must be darling sounds great what the heck is file and that is no I have matching PK's shoes and hat with file trim how wonderful is this thrilling what are you wearing Marjorie well I have the cutest linen dress with a full skirt and fitted top and it has eyelet trim very smart I can see there's no conversation for a man oh oh throughout Morton here we are talking about our new outfits not letting you get a word in you l I know you're gonna be so handsome in your new Easter suit action well thank you I like to see men dressed up you know people don't just look at the pretty girl yeah I hope you got a powder blue pinstripe I just love them well yes indeed Paula right nerely good bye Paula honky I thought you decided not to go the service and why shouldn't I go this winter up talk him into it miss Marjorie she had nothing to do with it no I thought you weren't going because of what the judge mr.

the morgue they call her Jane Doe number seven just by accident we'd come across a concrete lead on the killer's method of operation the picture we showed the man on the donut shop was a shot of the Stranglers first victim the night before evidently the killer would enter a bar coffee shop or restaurant strike up a conversation with a woman make friends with it either buy her drinks to invite her

Korby in place is a rest home Hansons there is a patient been there for the past for a month or doctor says he's bedridden we checked on the rest home it was a private sanitarium in the valley we got in touch with the medical authorities and found that the head of the hospital was listed as dr. James Corby Frank and I drove out and talk to dr. Korby and the rest of the staff from then we got the story that Hanson had been a resident of the home for the past four month we found that he had a learning ailment was confined to his bed 24 hours a day the doctor showed us his records and charts what we could tell it would have been impossible for Hanson killed in the Bandit three week span on August 4th the market thieves hit again this time out in Los Angeles they got away with a little over $9,000 the manager of the market came downtown and check the rug books they again identified Hanson as the thief we had the stats office make another run on the mo use the result came back and out of the thousands of cards check only one fitted the way the robbery had been carried out Hanson's we called the rest home and found it on the day of the holdup for such they hadn't left his bed another month past during that time we ran down all leads informants were questioned that they could tell us nothing apparently the holdup men were hitting and then dropping completely out of sight until late again Monday October 27th 8:05 a.m. I checked in for work so yeah just get in a couple of minutes ago sure is a beautiful day in glad you see did he in yet oh well he talked yesterday I don't want to nice pretty Hank I can't blame too much the guy sure seemed to have a stop thing I can't understand is that everybody's positive with Hanson doesn't seem to be any dominant minds doesn't make any sense to get the kickback on the doctor yeah I came in late yesterday I'll buy don't can't find anything on him family man lives out in the valley couple blocks in the hospital protect his bank account he does pretty well not great no big deposits lately you check the AME on him yeah he's not a member and got a nine how about the rest of the staff out there mom seemed to be okay two of the nurses have been there for over two years and the male nurse was hired about five months ago that'll be just before handsome guy thing yeah what's his record there isn't any nothing on him in the finals nothing from Washington and I don't know we seem to come up out of the ground pull the job and drop back in nothing on the partner no thought I had something talk to informit this morning or I had coffee he thought at first that he knew who the little guy was but I remember that the fella he was thinking about died two years ago hotshot I'll get it let's go my hit again at 8:01 a.m. that morning a pair of holdup men had walked into a market out on Adams Boulevard and robbed the place of a little under $11,000 the manager gave us a description of the holdup men one was large dark and had a small scar over the bridge of his nose the other was small sandy haired and had no visible marks or scar we showed the manager mug shots of Hanson he positively identified him as the larger of the two men a local and an APB was data now repair and then Frank and I drove out to the hospital to see Anthem 8:46 a.m. we talked with dr. Korby I know you men are trying to do your duty but I told you before it couldn't possibly be mr. Hanson I know for a fact that he hasn't been out of his bed this morning was it possible for him to get out of his room without you knowing no one if we could see him back no I don't think that'd be possible he's still asleep and I can't have him disturbed you're sure though that he couldn't have left the hospital without you knowing it absolutely no chance of it what time does Hanson general wake up doctor depends usually though I'd say he's awake by 9:30 or so what if we could wait and talk to him if you like I'll tell one of the nurses to call you when he's awake I'll let you that'd be fine one thing though I must insist on what they're they mustn't be excited I don't think you gentlemen really know how ill mr. Hanson is if you had any idea you wouldn't be out here with this ridiculous questioning yes sir we understand just trying to get this thing straight now as we can fine I'll go along with you part of the way but I'll not have my patient disturbed then the excitement would be very bad for him well don't worry doctor we'll be as brief as possible fine she'll excuse me now I've got some things to do I'll tell the nurse to call you when it wakes up and remember no excitement well you figure Joe I've got me way he talks every one of those witnesses are wrong yeah it's happened before get a positive identification and end up with the wrong guy but all of them are so far there were just as many cents yeah your police officer that's right why Bob Jameson my work here oh yeah you're the male notice that right yeah you have here about Bonnie Hanson aren't you we want to see him yet what can we do for you it's about Barney what about it I don't think things are the way they look worried about that I wouldn't want the doctor know I've been talking to you'd raise the roof probably fire me what's it about Jameson like I said it's about Barney yeah when I came here they told me that bonnie was pretty sick said they didn't expect him to live though I made a buzzer rang in his room you know he wanted some big horrible well the doctor was on the phone the other nurses were busy so I started down the hall to see what Barney wanted got to the door of their own and the doctor stopping uh-huh really read me off said that I wasn't going to the room at all but he was taking care of Barney person me that he'd see what he wanted yell that was just the first time same things happened a couple more times he told us about you told us what to say if you asked any questions well would be fed so that we wasn't it tell you anything that we didn't know anything well why didn't you tell us all this before then you see this isn't a regular in hospital I don't think that he's even a regular doctor I worked around hospitals for a long time I never saw a doctor act like he does he doesn't even know how to write out a diet feed some of the people hear all the wrong fate that right yeah and I'll tell you something else too what's that I don't think there's anything wrong with Barney I think the whole reason for being here is pulling Bob oh yes doctor what are you doing here I came to see these gentlemen needed anything Oh mm-hmm well I'll take care of it now will you check on mr.
